abstract = {Optimizing traditional training methods to elicit greater adaptations is paramount for athletes. Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) can improve maximal exercise capacity and up-regulate signaling pathways involved in physiological training adaptations. However, data on the chronic use of IPC are scarce and its impact on high-intensity training is still unknown. We investigated the benefits of adding IPC to sprint-interval training (SIT) on performance and physiological adaptations of endurance athletes. In a randomized controlled trial, athletes included eight SIT sessions in their training routine for 4 weeks, preceded by IPC (3 × 5min ischemia/5min reperfusion cycles at 220 mmHg, n = 11) or a placebo (20 mmHg, n = 9). Athletes were tested pre-, mid-, and post-training on a 30 s Wingate test, 5-km time trial (TT), and maximal incremental step test. Arterial O2 saturation, heart rate, rate of perceived exertion, and quadriceps muscle oxygenation changes in total hemoglobin (1[THb]), deoxyhemoglobin (1[HHb]), and tissue saturation index (1TSI) were measured during exercise. Blood samples were taken pre- and post-training to determine blood markers of hypoxic response, lipid-lipoprotein profile, and immune function. Differences within and between groups were analyzed using Cohen's effect size (ES). Compared to PLA, IPC improved time to complete the TT (Mid vs. Post: −1.6%, Cohen's ES ± 90% confidence limits −0.24, −0.40;−0.07) and increased power output (Mid vs. Post: 4.0%, ES 0.20, 0.06;0.35), 1[THb] (Mid vs. Post: 73.6%, ES 0.70, −0.15;1.54, Pre vs. Post: 68.5%, ES 0.69, −0.05;1.43), 1[HHb] (Pre vs. Post: 12.7%, ES 0.24, −0.11;0.59) and heart rate (Pre vs. Post: 1.4%, ES 0.21, −0.13;0.55, Mid vs. Post: 1.6%, ES 0.25, −0.09;0.60). IPC also attenuated the fatigue index in the Wingate test (Mid vs. Post: −8.4%, ES −0.37, −0.79;0.05). VO2peak and maximal aerobic power remained unchanged in both groups. Changes in blood markers of the hypoxic response, vasodilation, and angiogenesis remained within the normal clinical range in both groups. We concluded that IPC combined with SIT induces greater adaptations in cycling endurance performance that may be related to muscle perfusion and metabolic changes. The absence of elevated markers of immune function suggests that chronic IPC is devoid of deleterious effects in athletes, and is thus a safe and potent ergogenic tool.},

abstract = {Executive functioning and attention require mental effort. In line with the resource conservation principle, we hypothesized that mental effort would be saved when individuals expected to exercise for a long period. Twenty-two study participants exercised twice on a cycle ergometer for 10 min at 60% of their maximal aerobic power, with the expectation of exercising for either 10 min or 60 min. Changes in activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rdlPFC) and right medial frontal cortex (rmPFC) were investigated by measuring oxyhemoglobin using near-infrared spectroscopy. Attentional focus and ratings of perceived exertion were assessed at three time points (200, 400, and 600 s). The oxyhemoglobin concentration was lower in the rdlPFC and higher in the rmPFC under the 60-min than under the 10-min condition. Also, attention was less focused in the 60-min than in the 10-min condition. We discuss these results as possible evidence of a disengagement of the brain regions associated with mental effort (executive network), in favor of brain regions linked to resting activity (the default network), in order to save mental resources for the maintenance of exercise.},

abstract = {Background Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements of oxygenation reflectO2 delivery and utilization in exercising muscle and may improve detection of a critical exercise threshold. Purpose First, to detect an oxygenation breakpoint ($\Delta$[O2HbMb-HHbMb]-BP) and compare this breakpoint to ventilatory thresholds during a maximal incremental test across sexes and training status. Second, to assess reproducibility of NIRS signals and exercise thresholds and investigate confounding effects of adipose tissue thickness on NIRS measurements. Methods Forty subjects (10 trained male cyclists, 10 trained female cyclists, 11 endurance trained males and 9 recreationally trained males) performed maximal incremental cycling exercise to determine $\Delta$[O2HbMb-HHbMb]-BP and ventilatory thresholds (VT1 and VT2). Muscle haemoglobin and myoglobin O2 oxygenation ([HHbMb], [O2HbMb], SmO2) was determined in m. vastus lateralis. $\Delta$[O2HbMb-HHbMb]-BPwas determined by double linear regression. Trained cyclists performed the maximal incremental test twice to assess reproducibility. Adipose tissue thickness (ATT) was determined by skinfold measurements. Results $\Delta$[O2HbMb-HHbMb]-BPwas not different from VT1, but only moderately related (r = 0.58- 0.63, p<0.001). VT1 was different across sexes and training status, whereas $\Delta$[O2HbMb-HHbMb]-BP differed only across sexes. Reproducibilitywas high for SmO2 (ICC = 0.69- 0.97), $\Delta$[O2HbMb-HHbMb]-BP (ICC = 0.80-0.88) and ventilatory thresholds (ICC = 0.96- 0.99).SmO2 at peak exercise and at occlusion were strongly related to adipose tissue thickness (r2 = 0.81, p<0.001; r2 = 0.79, p<0.001). Moreover, ATT was related to asymmetric changes in $\Delta$[HHbMb] and $\Delta$[O2HbMb] during incremental exercise (r = -0.64, p<0.001) and during occlusion (r = -0.50, p<0.05). Conclusion Although the oxygenation threshold is reproducible and potentially a suitable exercise threshold, VT1 discriminates better across sexes and training status during maximal stepwise incremental exercise. Continuous-wave NIRS measurements are reproducible, but strongly affected by adipose tissue thickness.},

abstract = {Background: Symptoms of fatigue and pain are often reported for the trapezius muscle in the shoulder. The present study evaluated endurance in the trapezius muscles of healthy participants using electric twitch mechanomyography (ETM). Methods: Surface electrodes and a tri-axial accelerometer were placed over the left trapezius muscle. Muscles were stimulated for 3 min each at 2 Hz, 4 Hz and 6 Hz. Maintenance of acceleration during muscle twitches was used to calculate an endurance index (EI). Subjects (n = 9) were tested on two separate days to assess reproducibility of the trapezius EI measurements. The endurance measurements were made on the wrist flexor and vastus lateralis muscles for comparison. Near infrared spectroscopy was used to measure muscle oxygenation (HbO2) during the stimulation protocol (n = 8). Results: Mean (SD) EI was 84.9% (8.7%), 63.3% (19.1%) and 41.7% (20.0%) for 2 Hz, 4 Hz and 6 Hz, respectively. The coefficients of variation were 7.4%, 11.3% and 24.0% for 2 Hz, 4 Hz and 6 Hz, respectively. EI values were significantly lower in the trapezius compared to arm and leg muscles (p < 0.05). HbO2 values were unchanged from resting values with electrical stimulation. Conclusions: The EI as measured by ETM may provide a reproducible method of evaluating function in trapezius muscles that is not influenced by oxygen saturation.},

Eleven amateur team-sport athletes performed a repeated-sprint running protocol (4 sets of 4, 4-s all-out sprints; i.e., RSR444) under both conditions (14.5% and 20.9% O2) on a non-motorized treadmill. Changes in SpO2, prefrontal cortex total haemoglobin ($\Delta$[THb]), oxyhaemoglobin ($\Delta$[O2Hb]), deoxyhaemoglobin ($\Delta$[HHb]) and cognitive function (detection task: DET; identification task: IDN; one card learning task: OCL; performed pre and 20 min post RSR444) were examined. During RSH, SpO2 was lower following each set (p ≤ 0.05), while [HHb] was higher after each set (p ≤ 0.05) compared with RSN. In addition, while there was no effect of condition on DET (p = 0.20) or IDN (p = 0.14), OCL accuracy was lower after, compared with before, RSH (p=0.04), but not RSN (p = 0.52). A significant relationship was observed between ∆[HHB] and ∆OCL accuracy (r =-0.68, p = 0.01). Performance of a single bout of RSH with 14.5% O2 resulted in impaired cognitive function in amateur team-sport athletes. Coaches should be mindful of timing of RSH prescription with regard to other training sessions that challenge speed and movement accuracy.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: This study examined the effects of repeated long-duration hyperoxic water immersions (WIs) at 1.35 atmospheres absolute (ATA) on neuromuscular endurance performance. We hypothesized that over a 5-day period of consecutive, resting, long-duration hyperoxic WIs there would be a decrease to neuromuscular endurance performance and tissue oxygenation with the quadriceps muscle, but not with the forearm flexors. METHODS: Thirteen well-trained, male subjects completed five consecutive 6-h resting WIs with 18-h surface intervals during the dive week while breathing 100% oxygen at 1.35 ATA. We assessed skeletal muscle endurance performance before and after each WI, and 24 and 72 h after the final WI. Muscular endurance assessments included 40% maximal handgrip endurance (MHE) and 50-repetition maximal isokinetic (IK) knee extensions. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to measure muscle oxidative capacity (MOC) of the vastus lateralis and localized muscle tissue oxygenation of the vastus lateralis and flexor carpi radialis. Simultaneously, we measured brachioradialis neuromuscular activation by surface electromyography (SEMG). RESULTS: MHE time-to-fatigue performance declined by 15% at WI 3 (p = 0.009) and by 17% on WI 5 (p = 0.002). Performance continued to decline by 22% at 24-h post-WI (p < 0.001) and by 12% on 72-h post-WI (p = 0.019). Fifty-repetition IK knee extension total work decreased by 5% (p = 0.002) on WI 3, and was further reduced by 7.5 and 12.3% (p = 0.032) at pre-WI 5 and 24-h post-WI, respectively. However, the rate of fatigue was 8 (p = 0.033) and 30% (p = 0.017) lower at WI 3 and 24-h post-WI when compared to WI 1, respectively, demonstrating the muscles were still fatigued from the previous hyperoxic WIs. We detected no significant limitations in oxygen off-loading kinetics during the exercise or MOC measurements. CONCLUSION: Repeated, resting, long-duration hyperoxic WIs caused significant reductions to muscular endurance but not to indirect measures of oxygen kinetics in load bearing and non-load bearing muscles.},

abstract = {Purpose: To determine the effect of limb selection (upper/lower), cuff width (small (6 cm)/medium (13 cm) upper; medium/large (18 cm) lower) and anthropometry on arterial occlusion pressure (AOP) in ischemic preconditioning (IPC). Methods: Twenty athletes (10 females and 10 males) had surface anthropometry and dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) assessments before using Doppler ultrasound to confirm AOP for each limb. Subsequently, 5 min of occlusion occurred, with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measuring muscle oxygenation changes. Resultant AOP was compared between sexes, limbs and cuff sizes using linear regression models. Results: Mean AOP was higher in the lower limbs than the upper limbs (161 ± 18 vs. 133 ± 12 mm Hg; p <.001), and with smaller cuffs in upper (161 ± 16 vs. 133 ± 12 mm Hg; p <.001), but not lower limbs (161 ± 16 vs. 170 ± 26 mm Hg; p =.222). Sex and resting systolic blood pressure (SBP) accounted for 77% (small cuff) to 83% (medium cuff) of variance in AOP for upper limbs, and 61% (medium cuff) to 63% (large cuff) in lower limbs. Including anthropometry accounted for 82% (small cuff) to 89% (medium cuff) and 78% (medium cuff) to 79% (large cuff) of variance for upper and lower limbs, respectively. Adding DXA variables improved the explained variance up to 83% (small cuff) to 91% (medium cuff) and 79% (medium cuff) to 87% (large cuff) for upper and lower limbs, respectively. NIRS data showed significantly greater tissue oxygenation changes in upper versus lower limbs. Conclusions: The AOP in athletes is dependent on limb occluded, sex, SBP, limb and cuff size, and body composition.},

abstract = {Purpose: To compare prefrontal cortex oxygenation in recreationally-active women using oral contraceptives (WomenOC; n = 8) to women with a natural menstrual cycle (WomenNC; n = 8) during incremental exercise to exhaustion. Methods: Participants performed incremental cycling to exhaustion to determine lactate threshold 1 (LT1) and 2 (LT2) and peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak). Prefrontal cortex oxygenation was monitored via near-infrared spectroscopy through concentration changes in oxy-haemoglobin ($\Delta$[HbO2]), deoxy-haemoglobin ($\Delta$[HHb]), total-haemoglobin ($\Delta$[tHb]) and tissue saturation index (TSI). Results: 17$\beta$-oestradiol and progesterone were lower in WomenOC (35 ± 26; 318 ± 127 pmol{\textperiodcentered}L−1, respectively) than WomenNC (261 ± 156; 858 ± 541 pmol{\textperiodcentered}L−1, respectively). There were no differences in full blood examination results or serum nitric oxide (p > 0.05). However, WomenOC presented lower concentrations in ferric-reducing ability of plasma (− 8%; effect size; ES − 0.52 ± 0.61), bilirubin (− 32%; ES − 0.56 ± 0.62) and uric acid (− 17%; ES − 0.53 ± 0.61). Cardiopulmonary parameters were similar between groups during cycling, including VO2peak (p = 0.99). While there was a significant effect of time on all parameters measured by near-infrared spectroscopy during incremental cycling, there was no effect of OC at LT1, LT2 or exhaustion calculated as a change from baseline (TSI; p = 0.096, $\Delta$[HbO2]; p = 0.143, $\Delta$[HHb]; p = 0.085 and $\Delta$[tHb]; p = 0.226). The change in TSI from LT1 to LT2 was significantly different between groups (WomenNC; mean difference + 2.06%, WomenOC; mean difference − 1.73%; p = 0.003). Conclusion: Prefrontal tissue oxygenation declined at a lower relative exercise intensity in WomenOC as compared to WomenNC, however, this did not influence VO2peak. The results provide the first evidence for variance in the cerebral oxygenation response to exercise, which may be associated with female sex hormones.},

On visits 2–4, 2–10 days apart, 19 participants completed 4 sets of knee extensions (30% one-repetition maximum) with BFR (40% arterial occlusion pressure) to momentary failure (inability to lift load) using each muscle action (counterbalanced order). Ultrasound muscle thickness was measured at 60% and 70% of the anterior thigh before (Pre), immediately (Post-0), and 5 min (Post-5) after exercise. Surface electromyography and tissue deoxygenation were measured throughout. Results, presented as means, were analyzed with a three-way (sex by time by condition) Bayesian RMANOVA. Results There was a time by sex interaction (BFinclusion: 5.489) for left leg 60% muscle thickness (cm). However, changes from Pre to Post-0 (males: 0.39 vs females: 0.26; BF10: 0.839), Post-0 to Post-5 (males: − 0.05 vs females: − 0.06; BF10: 0.456), and Pre to Post-5 (males: 0.34 vs females: 0.20; BF10: 0.935) did not differ across sex. For electromyography (%MVC), there was a sex by condition interaction (BFinclusion: 550.472) with alternating having higher muscle excitation for females (16) than males (9; BF10: 5.097). Tissue deoxygenation (e.g. channel 1, µM) increased more for males (sets 1: 11.17; 2: 2.91; 3: 3.69; 4: 3.38) than females (sets 1: 4.49; 2: 0.24; 3: − 0.10; 4: − 0.06) from beginning to end of sets (all BFinclusion ≥ 4.295e + 7).

abstract = {New Findings: What is the central question of this study? Do patients with cystic fibrosis have reduced skeletal muscle oxidative capacity, measured with near-infrared spectroscopy, compared with demographically matched control subjects? What is the main finding and is its importance? Patients with cystic fibrosis have impairments in skeletal muscle oxidative capacity. This reduced skeletal muscle oxidative capacity not only appears to be accelerated by age, but it may also contribute to exercise intolerance in patients with cystic fibrosis. Exercise intolerance predicts mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF); however, the mechanisms have yet to be elucidated fully. Using near-infrared spectroscopy, in this study we compared skeletal muscle oxidative capacity in patients with CF versus healthy control subjects. Thirteen patients and 16 demographically matched control subjects participated in this study. Near-infrared spectroscopy was used to measure the recovery rate of oxygen consumption ( mus V˙O2 max) of the vastus lateralis muscle after 15 s of electrical stimulation (4 Hz) and subsequent repeated transient arterial occlusions. The mus V˙O2 max was reduced in patients with CF (1.82 ± 0.4 min-1) compared with control subjects (2.13 ± 0.5 min-1, P = 0.04). A significant inverse relationship between age and mus V˙O2 max was observed in patients with CF (r = -0.676, P = 0.011) but not in control subjects (r = -0.291, P = 0.274). Patients with CF exhibit a reduction in skeletal muscle oxidative capacity compared with control subjects. It appears that the reduced skeletal muscle oxidative capacity is accelerated by age and could probably contribute to exercise intolerance in patients with CF.},

Fifteen well-trained cyclists performed an exhaustive intermittent cycling exercise (EICE 1; 15 s at 30% of anaerobic power reserve interspersed with 45 s of passive recovery) at sea level (SL; FiO2 $\sim$ 0.21), moderate (MH; FiO2 $\sim$ 0.16) and severe hypoxia (SH; FiO2 $\sim$ 0.12). This was followed, after 30 min of passive recovery in normoxia, by an identical exercise bout in normoxia (EICE 2). Neuromuscular function of the knee extensors was assessed at baseline, after EICE 1 (post-EICE 1), and EICE 2 (post-EICE 2). The number of efforts completed decreased with increasing hypoxic severity during EICE 1 (SL: 39 ± 30, MH: 22 ± 13, SH: 13 ± 6; p ≤ 0.02), whereas there was no difference between conditions during EICE 2 (SL: 16 ± 9, MH: 20 ± 14, SH: 24 ± 17; p ≥ 0.09). Maximal torque (p = 0.007), peripheral (p = 0.02) and cortical voluntary activation (p < 0.001), and twitch torque (p < 0.001) decreased from baseline to post-EICE 1. Overall, there were no significant difference in any neuromuscular parameters from post-EICE 1 to post-EICE 2 (p ≥ 0.08). Increasing hypoxia severity during exhaustive intermittent cycling hampered exercise capacity, but did not influence performance and associated neuromuscular responses during a subsequent bout of exercise in normoxia performed after 30 min of rest.},

abstract = {Background: Abnormal ventilatory/hemodynamic responses to exercise contribute to functional impairment in patients with heart failure (HF). This study investigates how interval and continuous exercise regimens influence functional capacity by modulating ventilatory efficiency and hemodynamic function in HF patients. Methods: Forty-five HF patients were randomized to perform either aerobic interval training (AIT; 3-minute intervals at 40% and 80% VO2peak) or moderate continuous training (MCT; sustained 60% VO 2peak) for 30 min/day, 3 days/week for 12 weeks, or to a control group that received general healthcare (GHC). A noninvasive bio-reactance device was adopted to measure cardiac hemodynamics, whereas a near-infrared spectroscopy was employed to assess perfusion/O2 extraction in frontal cerebral lobe ({\^{a}}̂†[THb]FC / {\^{a}}̂†[HHb]FC) and vastus lateralis ({\^{a}}̂†[THb]VL / {\^{a}}̂†[HHb] VL), respectively. Results: Following the 12-week intervention, the AIT group exhibited higher oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES) and lower VE-VCO2 slope than the MCT and GHC groups. Furthermore, AIT, but not MCT, boosted cardiac output (CO) and increased {\^{a}}̂ †[THb]FC, {\^{a}}̂†[THb]VL, and {\^{a}}̂†[HHb]VL during exercise. In multivariate analyses, CO was the dominant predictor of VO2peak. {\^{a}}̂†[THb]FC and {\^{a}}̂†[THb] VL, which modulated the correlation between CO and OUES, were significantly correlated with OUES. Simultaneously, {\^{a}}̂†[THb] VL was the only factor significantly associated with V E-VCO2 slope. Additionally, AIT reduced plasma brain natriuretic peptide, myeloperoxidase, and interleukin-6 levels and increased the Short Form-36 physical/mental component scores and decreased the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire score. Conclusions: AIT effectively improves oxygen uptake efficiency by enhancing cerebral/muscular hemodynamics and suppresses oxidative stress/inflammation associated with cardiac dysfunction, and also promotes generic/disease-specific qualities of life in patients with HF. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Performing absolute measurements of tissue saturation of the brain with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a clinically desirable brain monitoring tool. Tissue oxygenation index (TOI) is an indicator of absolute tissue mixed arterial and venous oxygen saturation, and can be calculated using a NIRS technique called spatially resolved spectroscopy (SRS). SRS instruments measure the change of light attenuation with distance by using multiple light source-detector distances at two or more wavelengths. The aim of the study is to use broadband NIRS SRS data to investigate the effects on the calculation of TOI of different parameters: wavelength selection, scattering dependence, source-detector distance, and resolving for water. In total, 55 neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy were monitored using a broadband multi-distance continuous wave NIRS system; 172 datasets were recorded. Using a “Standard” approach, TOI values between 0 and 100% (“good”) were calculated in 157/172 datasets with a mean TOI of 50%. By changing the wavelength selection, the number of “good” data sets increases to 165/172 with a mean of 60%. Alteration of the dependence of scattering on wavelength acts as a constant which shifts the absolute value of TOI significantly (p < 0.05), demonstrating the importance of having a subject-appropriate estimation of scattering dependence. In general, changing the combination of source-detector distances does not significantly alter the TOI (the mean TOI ranges from 41% to 53%) which suggests that the algorithm is robust to different source-detector combinations. The study shows the broadband NIRS SRS algorithm gives the opportunity to explore the calculation of TOI and could further improve the measurement of tissue saturation in a clinical setting.},

Methods: Seven participants (26.6 ± 2.9 years old; 74.0 ± 13.1 kg; 1.76 ± 0.09 m) performed four sessions of RST (10-s maximal sprints with 20-s recovery until exhaustion) during both leg and arm cycling to measure power output and metabolic equivalents as well as oxygenation (near-infrared spectroscopy) of the muscle tissue and prefrontal cortex. Results: Mean power output was lower in arms than legs (316 ± 118 vs. 543 ± 127 W; p < 0.001) and there were no differences between conditions for a given limb. Arms demonstrated greater changes in concentration of deoxyhemoglobin (∆[HHb], − 9.1 ± 6.1 vs. − 6.5 ± 5.6 $\mu$m) and total hemoglobin concentration (∆[tHb], 15.0 ± 10.8 vs. 11.9 ± 7.9 $\mu$m), as well as the absolute maximum tissue saturation index (TSI, 62.0 ± 8.3 vs. 59.3 ± 8.1%) than legs, respectively (p < 0.001), demonstrating a greater capacity for oxygen extraction. Further, there were greater changes in tissue blood volume [tHb] during BFR only compared to all other conditions (p < 0.01 for all). Conclusions: The combination of BFR and/or hypoxia led to increased changes in [HHb] and [tHb] likely due to greater vascular resistance, to which arms were more responsive than legs.},

abstract = {In behavioral neuroscience, the adaptability of humans facing different constraints has been addressed on one side at the brain level, where a variety of functional networks dynamically support the same performance, and on the other side at the behavioral level, where fractal properties in sensorimotor variables have been considered as a hallmark of adaptability. To bridge the gap between the two levels of observation, we have jointly investigated the changes of network connectivity in the sensorimotor cortex assessed by modularity analysis and the properties of motor variability assessed by multifractal analysis during a prolonged tapping task. Four groups of participants had to produce the same tapping performance while being deprived from 0, 1, 2, or 3 sensory feedbacks simultaneously (auditory and/or visual and/or tactile). Whereas tapping performance was not statistically different across groups, the number of brain networks involved and the degree of multifractality of the inter-tap interval series were significantly correlated, increasing as a function of feedback deprivation. Our findings provide first evidence that concomitant changes in brain modularity and multifractal properties characterize adaptations underlying unchanged performance. We discuss implications of our findings with respect to the degeneracy properties of complex systems, and the entanglement of adaptability and effective adaptation.},

abstract = {Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can potentially be used to assess the cardiovascular autonomic system by monitoring orthostatic challenge-induced shifts in lower limb blood volume. However, in order to be of clinical utility the test must be valid, reliable, and relatively simple to conduct. Purpose To induce lower limb blood volume shifts using a 10 min 70° head-up tilt, and: (1) in the soleus, determine the validity of an inexpensive continuous wave (cw)-NIRS device by comparing to a criterion frequency-domain (fd-) NIRS device, (2) determine the between-day reliability of soleus assessments obtained from cw-NIRS and fd-NIRS; and, (3) compare the between-day reliability for fd-NIRS assessments obtained at the soleus (standard) and gastrocnemius (simpler alternative). Methods Fifteen non-smoking healthy adults were tested on 3 different mornings, under standardized conditions, separated by a maximum of 7 days. Total haemoglobin concentration (tHb) was continuously monitored bi-laterally in the medial soleus using cw-NIRS and fd-NIRS. For site comparison, tHb was measured in the medial gastrocnemius using fd-NIRS. Results (1) The area under the curve (AUC) for cw-NIRS and fd-NIRS assessments at the soleus were not significantly different (p = 0.619). (2) The criterion (0.75) intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was exceeded for both cw-NIRS and fd-NIRS. (3) The criterion ICC was exceeded for both soleus and gastrocnemius assessments. Conclusion Continuous-wave NIRS can be used to monitor orthostatic stress-induced shifts in lower leg blood volume with acceptable validity and reliability. This orthostatic test may present a relatively simple and inexpensive approach for assessing the cardiovascular autonomic nervous system.},

abstract = {The organisation of language in the brain of multilingual people remains controversial. Using a high temporal resolution 12-channel near-infrared continuous wave spectroscopy system, we have demonstrated that it is possible to monitor non-invasively, comfortably and, without the interferences due to intrinsic limitations of positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), cortical oxygenation changes in the Broca's area in response to translation of short sentences and language switching. Eight Dutch students proficient in English translated aloud from their native language into English or vice versa or alternating (switching) short visually presented sentences. These tasks provoked, in the left inferior frontal cortex which includes the Broca's area, a consistent and incremental rise in oxyhaemoglobin accompanied by a smaller decrease in deoxyhaemoglobin. The investigated cortical areas surrounding the Broca's area showed no uniform and consistent oxygenation changes upon the three different translation tasks. These results confirm that Broca's area is involved in the translation process and its so called activation is unaffected by the direction of the translation. In addition, these results strengthen the role of near-infrared multi-point measurements as a powerful tool for investigating the spatial and temporal features of the cortical oxygenation changes during language processing. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Almost no hemodynamic response was found in the extra-cerebral region in both the motor task and the startling test. In the motor task, as expected we found a canonical hemodynamic response in the cerebral region when sheep were walking. In the startling test, the measured hemodynamic response in the cerebral region was mainly from movement. Overall, these results indicate that with the current setup and probe positioning we are primarily measuring the motor area of the sheep brain, and not probing the too deeply located cortical areas related to processing of emotions.},

abstract = {Background: Insulin-stimulated muscle blood flow facilitates plasma glucose disposal after a meal, a mechanism that is impaired in obese, insulin-resistant volunteers. Nitrate- or flavonoid-rich products, through their proposed effects on nitric oxide, may improve postprandial blood flow and, subsequently, glucose disposal. To investigate whether a single dose of nitrate-rich beetroot juice or flavonoid-rich black tea lowers postprandial muscle vascular resistance in obese volunteers and alters postprandial glucose or insulin concentrations. Method: In a randomised, controlled, cross-over study, 16 obese, insulin-resistant males consumed 75 g glucose, which was combined with 100 ml black tea, beetroot juice or control (water). Peripheral vascular resistance (VR), calculated as mean arterial pressure divided by blood flow, was assessed in the arm and leg conduit arteries, resistance arteries and muscle microcirculation across 3 h (every 30-min) after the oral glucose load. Results: During control, we found no postprandial response in VR in conduit, resistance and microvessels (all P > 0.05). Black tea decreased VR compared to control in conduit, resistance and microvessels (all P < 0.05). Beetroot juice decreased postprandial VR in resistance vessels, but not in conduit artery and microvessels. Although postprandial glucose response was similar after all interventions, postprandial insulin response was attenuated by $\sim$29 % after tea (P < 0.0005), but not beetroot juice. Conclusions: A single dose of black tea decreased peripheral VR across upper and lower limbs after a glucose load which was accompanied by a lower insulin response. Future studies in insulin-resistant subjects are warranted to confirm the observed effects and to explore whether long-term regular tea consumption affects glucose homeostasis. Trial registration: The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov on 30th November 2012 (NCT01746329).},

abstract = {The magnitude and timing of oxygenation responses in highly active leg muscle, less active arm muscle, and cerebral tissue, have not been studied with simultaneous alveolar gas exchange measurement during incremental treadmill exercise. Nor is it known, if blood O 2 carrying capacity affects the tissue-specific oxygenation responses. Thus, we investigated alveolar gas exchange and tissue (m. vastus lateralis, m. biceps brachii, cerebral cortex) oxygenation during incremental treadmill exercise until volitional fatigue, and their associations with blood O 2 carrying capacity in 22 healthy men. Alveolar gas exchange was measured, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to monitor relative concentration changes in oxy- ($\Delta$[O 2Hb]), deoxy- ($\Delta$[HHb]) and total hemoglobin ($\Delta$[tHb]), and tissue saturation index (TSI). NIRS inflection points (NIP), reflecting changes in tissue-specific oxygenation, were determined and their coincidence with ventilatory thresholds [anaerobic threshold (AT), respiratory compensation point (RC); V-slope method] was examined. Blood O 2 carrying capacity [total hemoglobin mass (tHb-mass)] was determined with the CO-rebreathing method. In all tissues, NIPs coincided with AT whereas RC was followed by NIPs. High tHb-mass associated with leg muscle deoxygenation at peak exercise (e.g., $\Delta$[HHb] from baseline walking to peak exercise vs. tHb-mass: r = 0.64, p < 0.01), but not with arm muscle- or cerebral deoxygenation. In conclusion, regional tissue oxygenation was characterized by inflection points, and tissue oxygenation in relation to alveolar gas exchange during incremental treadmill exercise resembled previous findings made during incremental cycling. It was also found out, that O 2 delivery to less active m. biceps brachii may be limited by an accelerated increase in ventilation at high running intensities. In addition, high capacity for blood O 2 carrying was associated with a high level of m. vastus lateralis deoxygenation at peak exercise. {\textcopyright} 2012 Rissanen, Tikkanen, Koponen, Aho, H{\"{a}}gglund, Lindholm and Peltonen.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to explore the application of near- infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to the assessment of peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD). Muscle blood flow, oxygen consumption, arterial inflow capacity, O2 resaturation, and recovery times were determined at rest, under ischemic and hyperemic conditions, and continuously during and after walking exercise in 11 claudicants and 15 nonclaudicants. Blood flow and oxygen consumption (V̇O2) at rest and blood flow following walking exercise did not differ significantly between claudicants and nonclaudicants. In contrast, V̇O2 after walking exercise was increased by a factor of 4.1 in claudicants compared to a factor of 1.7 in nonclaudicants. The oxygen resaturation rate after arterial occlusion and the oxygen resaturation rate after walking exercise were significantly lower in claudicants. Claudicants showed a higher degree of hemoglobin deoxygenation during walking exercise than nonclaudicants. A high postexercise V̇O2 is correlated with a low ankle-brachial index (ABI). The resaturation rates and recovery times following walking exercise and arterial occlusion correlated significantly with ABI parameters. A significant negative correlation was found between hemoglobin deoxygenation during exercise and the ABI parameters. A high correlation was observed between the oxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb) recovery time and the ABI recovery time after walking exercise. NIRS appears to be an effective noninvasive method for assessing the imbalance between oxygen demand and oxygen delivery in the leg muscles of PAOD patients at rest and during exercise.},

Methods: Fourteen well-trained cyclists (V˙ O 2peak: 62 ± 9 mL kg−1 min−1) completed seven laboratory visits. At visit 1, the participants' peak oxygen consumption (V˙ O 2peak) and lactate thresholds were determined. At visits 2–7, participants completed either a 6 × 4 min or 3 × 8 min high-intensity interval training (HIIT) protocol with one of three recovery intensity prescriptions: passive (PA) recovery, active recovery at 80% of lactate threshold (80A) or active recovery at 110% of lactate threshold (110A). Results: The time spent at > 80%, > 90% and > 95% of maximal minute power during the work intervals was significantly increased with PA recovery, when compared to both 80A and 110A, during both HIIT protocols (all P ≤ 0.001). However, recovery intensity had no effect on the time spent at > 90% V˙ O 2peak (P = 0.11) or > 95% V˙ O 2peak (P = 0.50) during the work intervals of both HIIT protocols. Session RPE was significantly higher following the 110A recovery, when compared to the PA and 80A recovery during both HIIT protocols (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Passive recovery facilitates a higher work interval PO and similar internal stress for a lower sRPE when compared to active recovery and therefore may be the efficacious recovery intensity prescription.},

abstract = {After spinal cord injury (SCI) skeletal muscle decreases in size, increases in intramuscular fat, and has potential declines in mitochondrial function. Reduced mitochondrial function has been linked to the development of metabolic disease. The aim of this study was to measure mitochondrial function in persons with SCI using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Oxygen consumption of the vastus lateralis muscle was measured with NIRS during repeated short-duration arterial occlusions in nine able-bodied (AB) and nine persons with motor complete SCI. Skeletal muscle oxidative capacity (V max) was evaluated with two approaches: (1) rate constant of the recovery of oxygen consumption after exercise and (2) extrapolated maximum oxygen consumption from a progressive work test. V max as indicated by the rate constant (k) from the recovery kinetics test was lower in SCI compared with AB participants (k: SCI 0.7 ± 0.3 vs. AB 1.9 ± 0.4 min-1; p < 0.001). Time constants were SCI 91.9 ± 37.8 vs. AB 33.6 ± 8.3 s. V max from the progressive work test approached a significant difference between groups (SCI 5.1 ± 2.9 vs. AB 9.8 ± 5.5 % Hb-Mb/s; p = 0.06). NIRS measurements of V max suggest a deficit of 50-60 % in participants with SCI compared with AB controls, consistent with previous studies using 31P-MRS and muscle biopsies. NIRS measurements can assess mitochondrial capacity in people with SCI and potentially other injured/diseased populations. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Study objectives: Effects of chronic metabolic alkalosis and acidosis and their relation to central chemoregulation may differ between normocapnic and chronic hypercapnic patients with COPD. The relationship between responses of inspired ventilation (VI), mouth occlusion pressure (P0.1), and cerebral blood volume (CBV), to short-term changes in arterial Pco2 was measured. Patients and methods: Seventeen patients with chronic hypercapnia and COPD(Paco2 > 6.0 kPa) and 16 normocapnic patients with COPD (Paco2 ≤ 6.0 kPa) [FEV1 27% predicted] were studied under baseline metabolic conditions and after 1 week of treatment with oral furosemide, 40 mg/d, or acetazolamide, 500 mg/d. Hypercapnia (change in end-tidal carbon dioxide > 1 kPa) was induced by administering adequate amounts of carbon dioxide in the inspired air. CBV was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy. Results: Compared with baseline metabolic condition, chronic metabolic acidosis and alkalosis did not change ventilatory ($\Delta$VI/$\Delta$Paco2) and cerebrovascular ($\Delta$CBV/$\Delta$Paco2) reactivity. Base excess (BE) decreased by 6.8 ± 1.1 mEq/L and 6.9 ± 1.6 mEq/L, respectively, in the normocapnic and chronic hypercapnic COPD groupsduring metabolic acidosis, resulting in a not-quite-significant leftward shift of both the ventilatory and cerebrovascular carbon dioxide response curve. BE increased by 2.3 ± 1.2 mEq/L and 1.2 ± 1.3 mEq/L, respectively, during chronic metabolic alkalosis in both COPD groups, without concomitant shift. Poor correlations between ventilatory and cerebrovascular carbon dioxide responsiveness ($\Delta$CBV/$\Delta$Paco2 and $\Delta$VI/$\Delta$Paco2, $\Delta$CBV/$\Delta$Paco2 and $\Delta$P0.1/$\Delta$Paco2, respectively) were found irrespective of baseline, respiratory condition, and induced metabolic state. Conclusions: Normocapnic and chronic hypercapnic COPD patients have the same ventilatory and cerebrovascular carbon dioxide responsiveness irrespective of induced metabolic state. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This study evaluated the effects of nitrate (NO3-) supplementation on NO bioavailability, physiological and cognitive function, and exercise performance at moderate and very-high simulated altitude. Methods:Ten males (mean (SD): V˙O2max: 60.9 (10.1) ml{\textperiodcentered}kg-1{\textperiodcentered}min-1) rested and performed exercise twice at moderate ($\sim$14.0% O2; $\sim$3,000 m) and twice at very-high ($\sim$11.7% O2; $\sim$4,300 m) simulated altitude. Participants ingested either 140 ml concentrated NO3--rich (BRJ; $\sim$12.5 mmol NO3-) or NO3--deplete (PLA; 0.01 mmol NO3-) beetroot juice 2 h before each trial. Participants rested for 45 min in normobaric hypoxia prior to completing an exercise task. Exercise comprised a 45 min walk at 30% V˙O2max and a 3 km time-trial (TT), both conducted on a treadmill at a 10% gradient whilst carrying a 10 kg backpack to simulate altitude hiking. Plasma nitrite concentration ([NO2-]), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), pulmonary oxygen uptake (V˙O2), muscle and cerebral oxygenation, and cognitive function were measured throughout. Results: Pre-exercise plasma [NO2-] was significantly elevated in BRJ compared with PLA (p = 0.001). Pulmonary V˙O2 was reduced (p = 0.020), and SpO2 was elevated (p = 0.005) during steady-state exercise in BRJ compared with PLA, with similar effects at both altitudes. BRJ supplementation enhanced 3 km TT performance relative to PLA by 3.8% [1,653.9 (261.3) vs. 1718.7 (213.0) s] and 4.2% [1,809.8 (262.0) vs. 1,889.1 (203.9) s] at 3,000 and 4,300 m, respectively (p = 0.019). Oxygenation of the gastrocnemius was elevated during the TT consequent to BRJ (p = 0.011). The number of false alarms during the Rapid Visual Information Processing Task tended to be lower with BRJ compared with PLA prior to altitude exposure (p = 0.056). Performance in all other cognitive tasks did not differ significantly between BRJ and PLA at any measurement point (p ≥ 0.141). Conclusion: This study suggests that BRJ improves physiological function and exercise performance, but not cognitive function, at simulated moderate and very-high altitude.},

Each participant was randomly assigned to a single water- or land-based 50-minute bout of combined aerobic and resistance exercise. Blood samples were collected to detect pre- and post-exercise lactate concentration. Total hemoglobin, deoxidized hemoglobin, and the percentage change in the total oxygen saturation index (TSI%) of the rectus femoris were detected by means of near-infrared spectroscopy. We found similar RPE at various stages of land- and water-based exercise, and a similar change in lactate concentration in these environments (in water: 4.35 ± 1.49 mol/L; on land: 3.62 ± 1.18 mol/L). However, the reduction in HHb response was less pronounced after water-based exercise, and TSI% increased on land but decreased in water, with the magnitude of this change much higher on land. For similar RPE and lactate concentration, the oxygen saturation in the exercising muscles decreased in water, suggesting higher oxygen consumption in water than on land.},

abstract = {Improvements in the treatment of stroke lead to an increase in the number of patients living with the consequences of stroke. Although stroke induces cognitive impairment, a lack in mobility or difficulties in walking are common problems for stroke survivors and restoring the walking pattern is one of the main targets in the rehabilitation procedures. Perturbation application is helpful in creating a suitable environment in gait training and it drives problem solving. In our study we aimed to investigate the instantaneous and direct effectiveness of perturbation in stroke patients on the brain during walking by using Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) and also evaluated the cognitive functions of these patients by Mini Mental Test and Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Study groups were composed of 6 healthy and 6 stroke survivors. Perturbation was applied to subjects by using Re-Step Rehabilitation System and NIRS was used to analyse the instant effect of perturbation on oxygen consumption dynamics of the brain. Although HHb did not change in both groups, HbO2 value showed significant changes in healthy group during walking protocol of the study. Healthy Group Mini Mental Test score was found to be increased significantly when compared to Patient Group. We may suggest that the perturbation implantation increases the prefrontal circulation which is activated during motor planning and central input processing, especially in healthy group compared to stroke patients. This determination may consequently be thought as increase in activity in neural centers related to the task and parallel effect of plasticity.},

abstract = {Altitude ascending represents an intriguing experimental model reproducing physiological and pathophysiological conditions sharing hypoxemia as the denominator. The aim of the present study was to investigate fractional oxygen extraction and blood dynamics in response to hypobaric hypoxia and to acute resistance exercises, taking into account several factors including different ethnic origin and muscle groups. As part of the “Kanchenjunga Exploration & Physiology” project, six Italian trekkers and six Nepalese porters took part in a high altitude trek in the Himalayas. The measurements were carried out at low (1,450 m) and high altitude (HA; 4,780 m). Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-derived parameters, i.e., Tot-Hb and tissue saturation index (TSI), were gathered at rest and after bouts of 3-min resistive exercise, both in the quadriceps and in the forearm muscles. TSI decreased with altitude, particularly in forearm muscles (from 66.9 to 57.3%), whereas the decrement was less in the quadriceps (from 62.5 to 57.2%); Nepalese porters were characterized by greater values in thigh TSI than Italian trekkers. Tot-Hb was increased after exercise. At altitude, such increase appeared to be higher in the quadriceps. This effect might be a consequence of the long-term adaptive memory due to the frequent exposures to altitude. Although speculative, we suggest a long-term adaptation of the Nepalese porters due to improved oxygenation of muscles frequently undergoing hypoxic exercise. Muscle structure, individual factors, and altitude exposure time should be taken into account to move on the knowledge of oxygen delivery and utilization at altitude.},

abstract = {Background: Aerobic adaptations following interval training are supposed to be mediated by increased local blood supply. However, knowledge is scarce on the detailed relationship between exercise duration and local post-exercise blood supply and oxygen availability. This study aimed to examine the effect of five different exercise durations, ranging from 30 to 240 s, on post-exercise muscle oxygenation and relative changes in hemoglobin concentration. Methods: Healthy male subjects (N = 18) performed an experimental protocol of five exercise bouts (30, 60, 90,: 120, and 240 s) at 80 % of peak oxygen uptake VO2peak in a randomized order, separated by 5-min recovery periods. To examine the influence of aerobic fitness, we compared subjects with gas exchange thresholds (GET): above 60 % VO2peak (GET60+) with subjects reaching GET below 60 % VO2peak (GET60−). VO2 and relative changes in:: concentrations of oxygenated hemoglobin, deoxygenated hemoglobin, and total hemoglobin were continuously measured with near-infrared spectroscopy of the vastus lateralis muscle. Results: Post-exercise oxygen availability and local blood supply increased significantly until the 90-s exercise duration and reached a plateau thereafter. Considering aerobic fitness, the GET60+ group reached maximum post-exercise oxygen availability earlier (60 s) than the GET60− group (90 s). Conclusions: Our results suggest that (1) 90 s has evolved as the minimum interval duration to enhance local oxygen availability and blood supply following cycling exercise at 80 % VO2peak; whereas (2) 60 s is sufficient to: trigger the same effects in subjects with GET60 + .},

Methods: A total of 20 recreationally active participants completed 2 cycling RSE sessions, with and without lower-limb compression tights. The RSE session consisted of 4 sets of 10 × 6-s maximal sprints on a wind-braked cycle ergometer, interspaced by 24 s of recovery between bouts and 2 min of recovery between sets. Muscle oxygen consumption (mVO2) of, and blood flow (mBF) to, the right vastus lateralis muscle was measured during exercise using near-infrared spectroscopy and venous/arterial occlusions of the right lower limb. Cycling performance, oxygen consumption (VO2), heart rate, and capillary blood samples (lactate, pH, bicarbonate, and base excess) were also measured/taken throughout the session. Results: Compared with control, peak power (40.7 [19.9] W; mean ± 95% confidence intervals) and mBF (0.101 [0.061] mL{\textperiodcentered}min−1{\textperiodcentered}100 g−1) were higher, and heart rate (2 [1] beats/min) was lower, when participants wore compression (P < .05). mVO2, VO2, blood lactate, and heart rate increased as a result of exercise (P < .05), with no differences between conditions. Similarly, blood pH, bicarbonate, and base excess decreased as a result of exercise (P < .05), with no difference between conditions. Conclusions: Wearing lower-limb compression tights during RSE with short intervals of rest improved cycling performance, vastus lateralis mBF, and heart rate. These results provide novel data to support the notion that lower-limb compression garments aid RSE performance, which may be related to local and/or central blood flow.},

abstract = {Scenes from nature share in common certain statistical properties. Images with these properties can be processed efficiently by the human brain. Patterns with unnatural statistical properties are uncomfortable to look at, and are processed inefficiently, according to computational models of the visual cortex. Consistent with such putative computational inefficiency, uncomfortable images have been demonstrated to elicit a large haemodynamic response in the visual cortex, particularly so in individuals who are predisposed to discomfort. In a succession of five small-scale studies, we show that these considerations may be important in the design of the modern urban environment. In two studies we show that images from the urban environment are uncomfortable to the extent that their statistical properties depart from those of scenes from nature. In a third study we measure the haemodynamic response to images of buildings computed as having unnatural or natural statistical properties, and show that in posterior brain regions the images with unnatural statistical properties (often judged uncomfortable) elicit a haemodynamic response that is larger than for images with more natural properties. In two further studies we show that judgments of discomfort from real scenes (both shrubbery and buildings) are similar to those from images of the scenes. We conclude that the unnatural scenes in the modern urban environment are sometimes uncomfortable and place excessive demands on the neural computation involved in vision, with consequences for brain metabolism, and possibly also for health.},

With different sensor designs in the selection and configuration of light sources and detectors and implemented analysis algorithms in tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) extraction, substantial differences were observed between different commercially available CTO device measurements. Tissue models (phantoms) mimicking a human head both optically and anatomically provide the controllable, safe, universally agreeable, and reproducible environment for the evaluation of CTO device performances. In this article, we implemented our realistic and dynamic multilayer mixed solid and liquid phantom design with controlled and repeatable test procedures in the evaluation of multiple commercially available CTO devices. Performances were evaluated for each CTO device within themselves, across each other and a reference device simultaneously under continuously changing oxygen saturation conditions. Results indicated the feasibility of our phantoms in CTO device performance testing and suggested that in general, CTO device measurements were very precise ( S_ res < 1.48 %) and highly correlated ( R^2 > 0.89 and p < 0.0001 ) but had varying levels of accuracy, sensitivity, static, and proportional bias ( 15.4%< A_ rms < 21.1 %, 0.31 < sensitivity (regression slope) <0.43, and 35.94< bias (regression intercept) <49.74). In addition, gauge repeatability and reproducibility (Gauge R&R) analysis provided that most of the CTO devices were within acceptable ranges with precision-to-tolerance (P/T) ratio <10%, a number of distinct categories (NDC) >5, and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) >80%.},

abstract = {There is growing evidence showing that spinal manipulation increases muscle strength in healthy individuals as well as in people with some musculoskeletal and neurological disorders. However, the underlying mechanism by which spinal manipulation changes muscle strength is less clear. This study aimed to assess the effects of a single spinal manipulation session on the electrophysiological and metabolic properties of the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle. Maximum voluntary contractions (MVC) of the ankle dorsiflexors, high-density electromyography (HDsEMG), intramuscular EMG, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) were recorded from the TA muscle in 25 participants with low level recurring spinal dysfunction using a randomized controlled crossover design. The following outcomes: motor unit discharge rate (MUDR), strength (force at MVC), muscle conduction velocity (CV), relative changes in oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin were assessed pre and post a spinal manipulation intervention and passive movement control. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess within and between-group differences. Following the spinal manipulation intervention, there was a significant increase in MVC (p = 0.02; avg 18.87 ± 28.35%) and a significant increase in CV in both the isometric steady-state (10% of MVC) contractions (p < 0.01; avg 22.11 ± 11.69%) and during the isometric ramp (10% of MVC) contractions (p < 0.01; avg 4.52 ± 4.58%) compared to the control intervention. There were no other significant findings. The observed TA strength and CV increase, without changes in MUDR, suggests that the strength changes observed following spinal manipulation are, in part, due to increased recruitment of larger, higher threshold motor units. Further research needs to investigate the longer term and potential functional effects of spinal manipulation in various patients who may benefit from improved muscle function and greater motor unit recruitment.},

abstract = {This study was conducted to determine the effects of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) on respiratory and peripheral muscles oxygenation during a maximal exercise tolerance test and on repeated-sprint ability (RSA) performance in professional women football players. Eighteen athletes were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: SHAM (n = 8) or IMT (n = 10). After a maximal incremental exercise test, all participants performed (on a different day) a time-to-exhaustion (Tlim) test. Peripheral and respiratory muscles oxygenation by near-infrared spectroscopy, breath-by-breath ventilatory and metabolic variables, and blood lactate concentration were measured. The RSA test was performed on a grass field. After a 6 week intervention, all athletes were reevaluated. Both groups showed increases in inspiratory muscles strength, exercise tolerance and RSA performance, however only the IMT group presented lower deoxyhemoglobin and total hemoglobin blood concentrations on intercostal muscles concomitantly to an increased oxyhemoglobin and total hemoglobin blood concentrations on vastus lateralis muscle during Tlim. In conclusion, these results may indicate the potential role of IMT to attenuate inspiratory muscles metaboreflex and consequently improve oxygen and blood supply to limb muscles during high-intensity exercise, with a potential impact on inspiratory muscle strength, exercise tolerance and sprints performance in professional women football players.},

abstract = {Purpose of review Continuous wave near infrared spectroscopy (CW NIRS) provides non-invasive technology to measure relative changes in oxy- and deoxy-haemoglobin in a dynamic environment. This allows determination of local skeletal muscle O2 saturation, muscle oxygen consumption ( V˙O2 ) and blood flow. This article provides a brief overview of the use of CW NIRS to measure exercise-limiting factors in skeletal muscle. Recent findings NIRS parameters that measure O2 delivery and capacity to utilise O2 in the muscle have been developed based on response to physiological interventions and exercise. NIRS has good reproducibility and agreement with gold standard techniques and can be used in clinical populations where muscle oxidative capacity or oxygen delivery (or both) are impaired. CW NIRS has limitations including: the unknown contribution of myoglobin to the overall signals, the impact of adipose tissue thickness, skin perfusion during exercise, and variations in skin pigmentation. These, in the main, can be circumvented through appropriate study design or measurement of absolute tissue saturation. Summary CW NIRS can assess skeletal muscle O2 delivery and utilisation without the use of expensive or invasive procedures and is useable in large population-based samples, including older adults.},

abstract = {In this study, the performance and selected physiological responses to team-sport specific repeated-sprint and jump sequence were investigated. On four occasions, 13 team-sport players (22 ± 3 year) performed alternatively six repeated maximal straight-line or shuttle-sprints interspersed with a jump ([RS+j, 6 × 25 m] or [RSS+j, 6 × (2 × 12.5 m)]) or not ([RS, 6 × 25 m] or [RSS, 6 × (2 × 12.5 m)]) within each recovery period. Mean running time, rate of perceived exertion (RPE), pulmonary oxygen uptake ( $$ \dot{V} $$ O2), blood lactate ([La]b), and vastus lateralis deoxygenation ([HHb]) were obtained for each condition. Mean sprint times were greater for RS+j versus RS (4.14 ± 0.17 vs. 4.09 ± 0.16 s, with the qualitative analysis revealing a 82% chance of RS+j times to be greater than RS) and for RSS+j versus RSS (5.43 ± 0.18 vs. 5.29 ± 0.17 s; 99% chance of RSS+j to be >RSS). The correlation between sprint and jump abilities were large-to-very-large, but below 0.71 for RSSs. Jumps increased RPE (Cohen's d ± 90% CL: +0.7 ± 0.5; 95% chance for RS+j > RS and +0.7 ± 0.5; 96% for RSS+j > RSS), $$ \dot{V} $$ O 2 (+0.4 ± 0.5; 80% for RS+j > RS and +0.5 ± 0.5; 86% for RSS+j > RSS), [La]b (+0.5 ± 0.5; 59% for RS+j > RS and +0.2 ± 0.5; unclear for RSS+j > RSS), and [HHb] (+0.5 ± 0.5; 86% for RS +j > RS and +0.5 ± 0.5; 85% for RSS+j > RSS). To conclude, repeated-sprint and jump abilities could be considered as specific qualities. The addition of a jump within the recovery periods during repeated-sprint running sequences impairs sprinting performance and might be an effective training practice for eliciting both greater systemic and vastus lateralis physiological loads. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Background: Previous reports show that patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) rely on prefrontal activation to compensate for impaired motor function during complex activities such as obstacle negotiation. However, the influence of the properties of the obstacles on prefrontal activation has not been systematically evaluated. Here, we examined the effects of obstacle height and anticipation time on prefrontal activation in patients with PD and older adults. Methods: 34 patients with PD (age: 67.4 ± 5.7 years; 14 women) and 26 older adults (age: 71.3 ± 8.9 years; 11 women) walked in an obstacle course while negotiating anticipated and unanticipated obstacles (long/short available time response, ART) at heights of 50 mm and 100 mm. Prefrontal activation was measured using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS); obstacle negotiation performance was measured using Kinect cameras. Results: PD patients showed greater increases in prefrontal activation during and after obstacle crossing compared to the older adults (p < 0.001). Obstacle height affected prefrontal activity only when crossing anticipated obstacles (ARTxheight interaction, p = 0.011), in which case higher obstacles were accompanied by higher prefrontal activity. PD patients showed higher levels of activation during unanticipated obstacles, compared to older adults (groupXART: p = 0.015). Different correlations between prefrontal activation and obstacle negotiation strategies were observed in patients and controls. Conclusions: These results point to the use of prefrontal activation as a compensatory mechanism in PD. Moreover, the higher activation observed when negotiating more challenging obstacles suggests that there is greater reliance on cognitive resources in these demanding situations that may contribute to the higher risk of falls in PD patients.},

abstract = {We investigated whether leg and arm skeletal muscle, and cerebral deoxygenation, differ during incremental cycling exercise in men and women, and if women's lower capacity to deliver O2 affects tissue deoxygenation. Men (n=10) compared to women (n=10), had greater cardiac output, which with greater hemoglobin concentration produced greater absolute (QaO2) and body size-adjusted oxygen delivery (QaO2i) at peak exercise. Despite women's lower peak QaO2, their leg muscle deoxygenation was similar at a given work rate and QaO2, but less than in men at peak exercise ($\delta$tissue saturation index -27.1±13.2% vs. -11.8±5.7%, P<0.01; $\delta$[deoxyhemoglobin] 15.03±8.57$\mu$M vs. 3.73±3.98$\mu$M, P<0.001). At peak exercise, oxygen uptake was associated both with QaO2 and leg muscle deoxygenation (both P<0.01). Arm muscle and cerebral deoxygenation did not differ between sexes at peak exercise. Thus, both high O2 delivery and severe active muscle deoxygenation are determinants of good exercise performance, and active muscle deoxygenation responses are regulated partly in a sex-specific manner with an influence of exercise capacity. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Background: Little is known about the mechanistic basis for the exercise intolerance characteristic of patients with respiratory disease; a lack of clearly defined, distinct patient groups limits interpretation of many studies. The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the pulmonary oxygen uptake (V{\textperiodcentered}: O2) response, and its potential determinants, in patients with emphysema and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Methods: Following a ramp incremental test for the determination of peak V{\textperiodcentered}: O2 and the gas exchange threshold, six emphysema (66 ± 7 years; FEV1, 36 ± 16%), five IPF (65 ± 12 years; FEV1, 82 ± 11%) and ten healthy control participants (63 ± 6 years) completed three repeat, heavy-intensity exercise transitions on a cycle ergometer. Throughout each transition, pulmonary gas exchange, heart rate and muscle deoxygenation ([HHb], patients only) were assessed continuously and subsequently modelled using a mono-exponential with (V{\textperiodcentered}: O2, [HHb]) or without (HR) a time delay. Results: The V{\textperiodcentered}: O2 phase II time-constant ($\tau$) did not differ between IPF and emphysema, with both groups significantly slower than healthy controls (Emphysema, 65 ± 11; IPF, 69 ± 7; Control, 31 ± 7 s; P < 0.05). The HR $\tau$ was slower in emphysema relative to IPF, with both groups significantly slower than controls (Emphysema, 87 ± 19; IPF, 119 ± 20; Control, 58 ± 11 s; P < 0.05). In contrast, neither the [HHb] $\tau$ nor [HHb]:O2 ratio differed between patient groups. Conclusions: The slower V{\textperiodcentered}: O2 kinetics in emphysema and IPF may reflect poorer matching of O2 delivery-to-utilisation. Our findings extend our understanding of the exercise dysfunction in patients with respiratory disease and may help to inform the development of appropriately targeted rehabilitation strategies.},

abstract = {Context: Contrast baths (CB) is a thermal treatment modality used in sports medicine, athletic training, and rehabilitation settings. Proposed physiological effects of CB include increasing tissue blood flow and oxygenation and decreasing tissue swelling and edema to promote better healing, improved limb function, and quicker recovery. Objective: To investigate the physiological effects of CB on the intramuscular hemodynamics and oxygenation of the lower leg muscles using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), an optical method for monitoring changes in tissue oxygenated (O2Hb), deoxygenated (HHb), and total hemoglobin (tHb) as well as tissue oxygen saturation index (TSI%). Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Patients or Other Participants: Ten healthy men and women with a mean age of 29 (range ¼ 17 6 42) years, mean body mass index of 24.6 6 3.2, and mean adipose tissue thickness of 6.4 6 2.2 mm. Intervention(s): Conventional CB (10-minute baseline, 4: 1-minute hot: cold ratio) was applied to the left lower leg. Main Outcome Measure(s): Changes in chromophore concentrations of O2Hb, HHb, tHb, and TSI% of the gastrocnemius muscle were monitored during 10 minutes of baseline measurement, a 30-minute CB protocol, and 10 minutes of recovery using a spatially resolved NIRS. Results: After a 30-minute CB protocol, increases (P, .05) in tissue O2Hb (7.4 6 4 lM), tHb (7.6 6 6.1 lM), and TSI% (3.1% 6 2.3%) were observed as compared with baseline measures. Conclusions: Application of CB induced a transient change in the hemodynamics and oxygenation of the gastrocnemius muscle in healthy individuals. The effect of CB application in improving tissue hemodynamics and oxygenation may, therefore, support the therapeutic benefits of CB in the treatment of muscle injuries.},

abstract = {Central motor drive to active muscles is believed to be reduced during numerous exercise tasks to prevent excessive peripheral fatigue development. The purpose of the present study was to use hypoxia to exacerbate physiological perturbations during a novel, intermittent exercise task and to explore the time-course and interplay between central and peripheral neuromuscular adjustments. On separate days, 14 healthy men performed four sets of 6 × 5 maximal-intensity, isokinetic leg extensions (1 repetition lasting ∼7 s) at 300°/s (15 and 100 s of passive rest between repetitions and sets, respectively) under normoxia (NM, fraction of inspired O2 0.21), moderate (MH, 0.14), and severe normobaric hypoxia (SH, 0.10). Neuromuscular assessments of the knee extensors were conducted before and immediately after each set. There was an interaction between time and condition on the mean peak torque produced during each set (P < 0.05). RMS/M-wave activity of the rectus femoris decreased across the four sets of exercise, but there was no difference between conditions (8.3 ± 5.1% all conditions compounded, P > 0.05). Potentiated twitch torque decreased post set 1 in all conditions (all P < 0.05) with greater reductions following each set in SH compared with NM but not MH (end-exercise reductions 41.3 ± 3.0% vs. 28.0 ± 3.2%, P < 0.05 and 32.1 ± 3.3%, P > 0.05). In conclusion, severe hypoxia exacerbates both peripheral fatigue development and performance decrements during maximal, intermittent, dynamic leg extensions. In contrast to observations with other exercise modes, during exercise involving a single muscle group the attenuation of central motor drive does not appear to independently regulate the development of peripheral muscle fatigue.},

abstract = {Background: High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has been proposed as a time-efficient exercise format to improve exercise adherence, thereby targeting the chronic disease burden associated with sedentary behaviour. Exercise mode (cycling, running), if self-selected, will likely affect the physiological and enjoyment responses to HIIT in sedentary individuals. Differences in physiological and enjoyment responses, associated with the mode of exercise, could potentially influence the uptake and continued adherence to HIIT. It was hypothesised that in young sedentary men, local and systemic oxygen utilisation and enjoyment would be higher during a session of running HIIT, compared to a session of cycling HIIT. Methods: A total of 12 sedentary men (mean ± SD; age 24 ± 3 years) completed three exercise sessions: a maximal incremental exercise test on a treadmill (MAX) followed by two experiment conditions, (1) free-paced cycling HIIT on a bicycle ergometer (HIITCYC) and (2) constant-paced running HIIT on a treadmill ergometer (HIITRUN). Deoxygenated haemoglobin (HHb) in the gastrocnemius (GN), the left vastus lateralis (LVL) and the right vastus lateralis (RVL) muscles, oxygen consumption (VO2), heart rate (HR), ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and physical activity enjoyment (PACES) were measured during HIITCYC and HIITRUN. Results: There was a higher HHb in the LVL (p = 0.001) and RVL (p = 0.002) sites and a higher VO2 (p = 0.017) and HR (p < 0.001) during HIITCYC, compared to HIITRUN. RPE was higher (p < 0.001) and PACES lower (p = 0.032) during HIITCYC compared to HIITRUN. Discussion: In sedentary individuals, free-paced cycling HIIT produces higher levels of physiological stress when compared to constant-paced running HIIT. Participants perceived running HIIT to be more enjoyable than cycling HIIT. These findings have implications for selection of mode of HIIT for physical stress, exercise enjoyment and compliance.},

However, whether or not beetroot supplementation presents a beneficial effect on the exercise performance of jiu-jitsu athletes remains inconclusive. Therefore, the present study assessed the effect of beetroot-based gel (BG) supplementation on maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), exercise time until fatigue (ETF), muscle O2 saturation (Sm O2), blood volume (tHb), and plasma nitrate and lactate in response to handgrip isotonic exercise (HIE) in jiu-jitsu athletes. In a randomized, crossover, double-blind design, 12 jiu-jitsu athletes performed 3 sets of HIE at 40% of the MVC until fatigue after 8 days (the eighth dose was offered 120 min previous exercise) of BG supplementation or a nitrate-depleted gel (PLA), and forearm Sm O2 and tHb were continuously monitored by using near-infrared spectroscopy. Blood samples were taken before, immediately after exercise, and 20 min after exercise recovery in the PLA and BG conditions. MVC was evaluated at baseline and 20 min after HIE. There was a significant reduction in $\Delta$MVC decline after HIE in the BG condition. Forearm Sm O2 during exercise recovery was significantly greater only after BG supplementation. No significant difference in ETF and tHb were observed between both BG and PLA in response to HIE. Plasma nitrate increased only after BG, whereas the exercise-induced increase in plasma lactate was significantly lower in BG when compared with PLA. In conclusion, BG supplementation may be a good nutritional strategy to improve forearm Sm O2 and prevent force decline in response to exercise in jiu-jitsu athletes.},

abstract = {Objectives: in vitro assessment of the reproducibility and the optimal separation and position of the optodes in continuous wave (CW-) NIRS measurement of local inhomogeneities in absorption and/or scattering. Methods: a CW- NIRS system (OXYMON) was used with laser diodes at wavelengths of 767 nm, 845 nm, 905 nm, 945 nm and 975 nm. For practical considerations (dimensions of neonatal head) the measurements were perforated on a cylindrical tissue-equivalent phantom (70 mm diameter of base material with $\mu$a = 0.01 mm-1 (800 nm) and $\mu$′s = 1.00 mm-1 (800 nm)), containing rods with 10 × absorption, or 10 × scattering, and 5 × both Monte Carlo simulations were carried out of a cylinder with transport scattering coefficient $\mu$′s = 0.525 mm-1 and absorption coefficient $\mu$a = 0.075 mm-1 and two optode positions. Results: reproducibility of repeated measurements (n = 10) was ± 0.005 OD. Maximum OD in case of absorbing rod, and of absorbing + scattering rod was measured with optodes separated by 90° and rod position angle symmetrically (45°) in between. Minimum OD for these rods was obtained with optodes at 150° angle and rod position at 2400 (i.e. relative to transmitting optode position at 0°). A second maximum OD was obtained at an optode angle 180° and rod position at 180°. Maximum OD (i.e. attenuation) for the scattering rod was at optode separation angle of 90° and rod at 0°. Minimum OD for this case was obtained with optode angle of 180o and rod positions around 80° and 280°. Maximum OD changes by absorbing rod were in the order of +0.12 OD and -0.04 OD, respectively. Simulations at an optode separation angle of 90° showed a spatial sensitivity path enclosing the rod position at maximum absorption found experimentally. Conclusions: when considering the phantom as a realistic geometrical model for the neonatal head, it can be concluded that the optode position at 90° angle would be optimal for detecting an inhomogeneity at 15 mm depth, i.e. the location of the periventricular white matter. Since the rods are relatively strongly different from the base material the question remains to be answered whether local ischemia, which might lead to irreversible brain damage, can be detected by CW-NIRS.},

abstract = {Background:Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a neuromodulatory tech-nique that delivers low levels of a constant current via scalp electrodes to specificallytargeted areas of the brain. The effects of tDCS on whole-body exercise performance has been of interest in recent literature. The purpose of the current investigation was to investigate if tDCS, administered via Halo Sport, influences time trial performance in trained cyclists, and if changes in exercise performance are associated with prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation and/or muscle oxygenation (SmO2). Methods: Twelve recreationally trained cyclists volunteered to participate in two 10-kilometer time trials fol-lowing 20 minutes of tDCS or a sham condition. Results: T-tests showed there was no significant difference in performance (time to completion) or physiological measures (BLa-, HR, SmO2, PFC oxygenation) between the Halo and sham conditions. Conclusions: These results indicate that the application of tDCS via Halo Sport does not induce changes in exercise performance or related phys-iological parameters during a 10-kilometer cycling time trial.},

abstract = {Purpose: The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of graduated compression socks (GCS) on enhancing muscle blood flow and oxygenation during exercise and recovery in healthy subjects. Methods: Twelve healthy volunteers completed a protocol involving baseline, exercise, and recovery periods with and without GCS. Each test was repeated twice to assess repeatability of the results. The applied sock pressure was measured prior to experimentation using a custom pressure sensing system, and modified as necessary using tensor bandages to control the applied load. During each of the experimental phases, blood velocity in the popliteal artery, calf muscle tissue oxygenation, muscle activity, heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output, and applied pressure from the sock were measured. Popliteal artery diameter was measured during baseline and recovery periods. Results: The GCS significantly reduced deoxyhemoglobin (HHb) in the leg during baseline (HHb, p = 0.001) and total blood volume and HHb in the leg during exercise (total hemoglobin, p = 0.01; HHb, p = 0.02). However, there were no differences in leg muscle blood flow velocity or any other variables with and without GCS at baseline, exercise, or recovery. Interestingly, it was found that the local applied sock pressure was very sensitive to the sock application process and, furthermore, the pressure varied considerably during exercise. Conclusions: No significant changes were observed in measures reflecting oxygen delivery for healthy subjects using GCS during exercise and recovery. Applied sock pressure was carefully controlled, thus eliminating the sock application process as a variable.},

abstract = {Factors underlying the amplitude of exercise performance reduction at altitude and the development of high-altitude illnesses are not completely understood. To better describe these mechanisms, we assessed cardiorespiratory and tissue oxygenation responses to hypoxia in elite high-altitude climbers. Eleven high-altitude climbers were matched with 11 non-climber trained controls according to gender, age, and fitness level (maximal oxygen consumption, VO2 max ). Subjects performed two maximal incremental cycling tests, in normoxia and in hypoxia (inspiratory oxygen fraction: 0.12). Cardiorespiratory measurements and tissue (cerebral and muscle) oxygenation were assessed continuously. Hypoxic ventilatory and cardiac responses were determined at rest and during exercise; hypercapnic ventilatory response was determined at rest. In hypoxia, climbers exhibited similar reductions to controls in VO2 max (climbers -39 ± 7% vs controls -39 ± 9%), maximal power output (-27 ± 5% vs -26 ± 4%), and arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2 ). However, climbers had lower hypoxic ventilatory response during exercise (1.7 ± 0.5 vs 2.6 ± 0.7 L/min/%; P < 0.05) and lower hypercapnic ventilatory response (1.8 ± 1.4 vs 3.8 ± 2.5 mL/min/mmHg; P < 0.05). Finally, climbers exhibited slower breathing frequency, larger tidal volume and larger muscle oxygenation index. These results suggest that elite climbers show some specific ventilatory and muscular responses to hypoxia possibly because of genetic factors or adaptation to frequent high-altitude climbing.},

abstract = {Purpose: Aerobic endurance training (ET) increases systemic and peripheral oxygen utilisation over time, the adaptation pattern not being linear. However, the timing and mechanisms of changes in oxygen utilisation, associated with training beyond one year are not known. This study tested the hypothesis that in women aged 40-60 years performing the same current training load; systemic O2 utilisation (VO2) and tissue deoxyhaemoglobin (HHb) in the Vastus Lateralis (VL) and Gastrocnemius (GAST) would be higher in long term trained (LTT; > 5 yr) compared to a short term trained (STT; 6-24 months) participants during ramp incremental (RI) cycling, but similar during square-wave constant load (SWCL) cycling performed at the same relative intensity (below ventilatory turn point [VTP]); and that pre-frontal cortex (PFC) HHb would be similar between participant groups in both exercise conditions. Methods: Thirteen STT and 13 LTT participants performed RI and SWCL conditions on separate days. VO2, and VL, GAST, and PFC HHb were measured simultaneously. Results: VO2peak was higher in LTT compared to STT, and VO2 was higher in LTT at each relative intensities of 25%, 80% and 90% of VTP in SWCL. HHb in the VL was significantly higher in LTT compared to STT at peak exercise (4.54 ± 3.82 vs 1.55 ± 2.33 $\mu$M), and at 25% (0.99 ± 1.43 vs 0.04 ±0.96 $\mu$M), 80% (3.19 ±2.93 vs 1.14 ± 1.82 $\mu$M) and 90% (4.62 ±3.12 vs 2.07 ± 2.49 $\mu$M) of VTP in SWCL. Conclusions: The additional (12.9 ± 9.3) years of ET in LTT, resulted in higher VO2, and HHb in the VL at peak exercise, and sub-VTP exercise. These results indicate that in women 40-60 years old, systemic and muscle O2 utilisation continues to improve with ET beyond two years.},

abstract = {The development of novel miniaturized wireless and wearable functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) devices has paved the way for new functional brain imaging that could revolutionize the cognitive research fields. Over the past few decades, several studies have been conducted with conventional fNIRS systems that have demonstrated the suitability of this technology for a wide variety of populations and applications, to investigate both the healthy brain and the diseased brain. However, what makes wearable fNIRS even more appealing is its capability to allow measurements in everyday-life scenarios that are not possible with other gold-standard neuroimaging modalities, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging. This could have a huge impact on the way we explore the neural bases and mechanisms underpinning human brain functioning. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of studies conducted with wearable fNIRS in naturalistic settings in the field of cognitive neuroscience. In addition, we present the challenges associated with the use of wearable fNIRS in unrestrained contexts, discussing solutions that will allow accurate inference of functional brain activity. Finally, we provide an overview of the future perspectives in cognitive neuroscience that we believe would benefit the most from the study of wearable fNIRS devices.},

abstract = {Background: Gait and mobility impairments affect the quality of life (QoL) of patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). Robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) is an effective rehabilitative treatment but evidence of its superiority compared to other options is lacking. Furthermore, the response to rehabilitation is multidimensional, person-specific and possibly involves functional reorganization processes. The aims of this study are: (1) to test the effectiveness on gait speed, mobility, balance, fatigue and QoL of RAGT compared to conventional therapy (CT) in progressive MS and (2) to explore changes of clinical and circulating biomarkers of neural plasticity. Methods: This will be a parallel-group, randomized controlled trial design with the assessor blinded to the group allocation of participants. Ninety-eight (49 per arm) progressive MS patients (EDSS scale 6-7) will be randomly assigned to receive twelve 2-h training sessions over a 4-week period (three sessions/week) of either: (1) RAGT intervention on a robotic-driven gait orthosis (Lokomat, Hocoma, Switzerland). The training parameters (torque of the knee and hip drives, treadmill speed, body weight support) are set during the first session and progressively adjusted during training progression or (2) individual conventional physiotherapy focusing on over-ground walking training performed with the habitual walking device. The same assessors will perform outcome measurements at four time points: baseline (before the first intervention session); intermediate (after six training sessions); end of treatment (after the completion of 12 sessions); and follow-up (after 3 months from the end of the training program). The primary outcome is gait speed, assessed by the Timed 25-Foot Walk Test. We will also assess walking endurance, balance, depression, fatigue and QoL as well as instrumental laboratory markers (muscle metabolism, cerebral venous hemodynamics, cortical activation) and circulating laboratory markers (rare circulating cell populations pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, growth factors, neurotrophic factors, coagulation factors, other plasma proteins suggested by transcriptomic analysis and metabolic parameters). Discussion: The RAGT training is expected to improve mobility compared to the active control intervention in progressive MS. Unique to this study is the analysis of various potential markers of plasticity in relation with clinical outcomes. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT02421731.

To resume interventions and assessments, many services are now using telehealth-based online platforms. Using the Zoom conferencing platform, our research group has been providing creative play-based interventions to school-age children with autism spectrum disorder. The feedback on this telehealth intervention experience has been generally positive (mean satisfaction score: 4.4 on a 5-point Likert-type scoring range) and our preliminary data from six children with autism spectrum disorder suggest training-related improvements in gross motor, balance, and imitation skills. Despite the positive results, it remains to be explored if the effects of telehealth interventions are similar to those of F2F interventions. Neuroimaging techniques could provide objective measures of intervention effects. However, this will require researchers to resume neuroimaging research while adopting safe public health protocols to control the risk of COVID-19 transmission. In this short report, we summarize existing safety protocols for F2F neuroimaging research, our own experiences of safely conducting alternative, on-site and off-site neuroimaging data collection, as well as the potential opportunities of using online data sharing and low-cost, remote neuroimaging/electrophysiological techniques to continue brain research during the pandemic.},

Objective: To determine if dry cupping therapy decreased pain and increased subcutaneous blood flow compared with sham cupping and control conditions. Design: Controlled laboratory study. Setting: Laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 32 participants (age ¼ 22.5 6 2.8 years, height ¼ 173.3 6 10.1 cm, mass ¼ 76.6 6 18.7 kg) with self-reported nonspecific neck pain. Intervention(s): We used dry cupping and sham cupping interventions and a control condition. For the dry cupping intervention, 1 stationary cup was placed directly over the most painful area for 8 minutes. The sham cupping intervention followed the same procedures as the dry cupping intervention except a sham cup was applied. For the control condition, participants received no treatment. Main Outcome Measure(s): Subjective pain intensity (visual analog scale); pain-pressure threshold; subcutaneous hemodynamics, including superficial and deep oxygenated, deoxygenated, and total hemoglobin levels; and tissue saturation index. Results: We observed differences in the visual analog scale score and the superficial and deep oxygenated and total hemoglobin levels (P values ≤ .002) immediately postintervention compared with baseline. Post hoc tests revealed that the dry cupping group had less pain than the sham cupping and control groups and higher superficial and deep oxygenated and total hemoglobin levels (P values ≤ .008). No differences were found between baseline and 24 hours postintervention. Conclusions: A single session of dry cupping therapy may be an effective short-term treatment method for immediately reducing pain and increasing oxygenated and total hemoglobin levels in patients with nonspecific neck pain.},

abstract = {This crossover study examined whether acute cardiovascular responses, baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS), and brain oxygenation during isometric exercise are altered after cigarette smoking. Twelve young, habitual smokers randomly performed a smoking and a control protocol, during which participants smoked one cigarette (0.9 mg nicotine) or a sham cigarette, before exercise. Testing involved baseline, a 5-minute smoking, a 10-minute post-smoking rest, 3-minute handgrip exercise (30% maximum voluntary contraction), and recovery. Beat-to-beat blood pressure, heart rate (HR), and cerebral oxygenation (near infrared spectroscopy) were continuously monitored. Double-product, stroke volume (SV), cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance and BRS were assessed. During post-smoking rest, systolic or diastolic blood pressure (140.8 ± 12.1/87.0 ± 6.9 vs. 125.9 ± 7.1/77.3 ± 5.5 mm Hg), HR, and double product were higher in the smoking versus the control protocol, whereas BRS was lower (P <.05). During handgrip exercise, smoking resulted in greater HR and double product (17,240 ± 3893 vs. 15,424 ± 3173 mm Hg{\textperiodcentered}bpm) and lower BRS versus the control protocol (P <.05), without significant differences in stroke volume and systemic vascular resistance between protocols. During recovery, smoking elicited a delayed return of brain oxygenation indices, lower BRS, and higher double product. Smoking a cigarette shortly before the exercise session amplifies myocardial stress and dysregulates autonomic function and cerebral oxygenation during exercise and recovery, even in young habitual smokers, perceived as free from long-term cardiovascular effects of smoking.},

Objectives: The objectives of this systematic review were to highlight the application of muscle oximetry in evaluating oxidative skeletal muscle performance to sport activities and emphasize how this technology has been applied to exercise and training. Methods: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed in a systematic fashion to search, assess and synthesize existing literature on this topic. The Scopus and MEDLINE/PubMed electronic databases were searched to 1 March 2017. Potential inclusions were screened against eligibility criteria relating to recreationally trained to elite athletes, with or without training programs, who must have assessed physiological variables monitored by commercial oximeters or NIRS instrumentation. Results: Of the 14,609 identified records, only 57 studies met the eligibility criteria. This systematic review highlighted a number of key findings in 16 sporting activities. Overall, NIRS information can be used as a marker of skeletal muscle oxidative capacity and for analyzing muscle performance factors. Conclusions: Although NIRS instrumentation is promising in evaluating oxidative skeletal muscle performance when used in sport settings, there is still the need for further instrumental development and randomized/longitudinal trials to support the detailed advantages of muscle oximetry utilization in sports science.},

abstract = {This study examined the electromyographic, cerebral and muscle hemodynamic responses during intermittent isometric contractions of biceps brachii at 20, 40, and 60% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). Eleven volunteers completed 2 min of intermittent isometric contractions (12/min) at an elbow angle of 90° interspersed with 3 min rest between intensities in systematic order. Surface electromyography (EMG) was recorded from the right biceps brachii and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to simultaneously measure left prefrontal and right biceps brachii oxyhemoglobin (HbO2), deoxyhemoglobin (HHb), and total hemoglobin (Hbtot). Transcranial Doppler ultrasound was used to measure middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAv) bilaterally. Finger photoplethysmography was used to record beat-to-beat blood pressure and heart rate. EMG increased with force output from 20 to 60% MVC (P < 0.05). Cerebral HbO2 and Hbtot increased while HHb decreased during contractions with differences observed between 60% vs. 40% and 20% MVC (P < 0.05). Muscle HbO2 decreased while HHb increased during contractions with differences being observed among intensities (P < 0.05). Muscle Hbtot increased from rest at 20% MVC (P < 0.05), while no further change was observed at 40 and 60% MVC (P > 0.05). MCAv increased from rest to exercise but was not different among intensities (P > 0.05). Force output correlated with the root mean square EMG and changes in muscle HbO2 (P < 0.05), but not changes in cerebral HbO2 (P > 0.05) at all three intensities. Force output declined by 8% from the 1st to the 24th contraction only at 60% MVC and was accompanied by systematic increases in RMS, cerebral HbO2 and Hbtot with a leveling off in muscle HbO2 and Hbtot. These changes were independent of alterations in mean arterial pressure. Since cerebral blood flow and oxygenation were elevated at 60% MVC, we attribute the development of fatigue to reduced muscle oxygen availability rather than impaired central neuronal activation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Bhambhani, Fan, Place, Rodriguez-Falces and Kayser.},

abstract = {In most team sports, intermittent high intensity sprint efforts combined with short recovery periods have been identified as a key factor of physical performance; the ability to repeat these efforts at a sustained level is of great importance. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been proposed as a tool to monitor muscle oxygenation changes during such sprint efforts. The purpose of this study was to observe muscle reoxygenation rate (reoxy rate) (% s-1) between sprint efforts in a repeat sprint cycle test. A two wavelength spatially resolved NIR spectrometer (Portamon, Artinis Inc.) was used to assess reoxy rate changes in the vastus lateralis of the dominant leg before and after a training stimulus. Eight UK premiership academy level rugby players were assessed (age 20.6 ± 0.9) years; height 187 ± 0.6 cm; weight 109.5 ± 8.6 kg; quadriceps skin fold 16.6 ± 4.5 mm); the subjects completed ten repeated 10-s cycle sprints interspersed with 40 s recovery, upon a Wattbike Pro cycle. Hemoglobin variables ($\Delta$HHb, $\Delta$tHb, $\Delta$O2Hb, $\Delta$TSI %) during the sprint and the post-sprint reoxygenation rate (%TSI sˉ1) were measured. During both cycle tests all subjects experienced a drop in muscle oxygen saturation (Pre-$\Delta$ − 12.39 ± 6.01%), Post-$\Delta$ − 14.83 ± 3.88%). Post-training, there was an increase in the extent of desaturation (drop in TSI %) in the group means, both for the biggest single change and the average of all ten changes. Seven out of eight players showed an increase based on the maximum change and six based on the average of their ten tests. Additionally, seven out of eight players showed a significant increase in $\Delta$HHb (Pre-$\Delta$ + 76.80 ± 61.92, Post-$\Delta$ + 121.28 ± 69.76) (p < 0.01) (including the one player who did not show a significant effect on the TSI measure). Players who exercised at the highest power tended to decrease their muscle oxygenation to a greater extent. The number of bike training sessions undertaken correlated with improvements in post-exercise recovery of oxygenation (R = 0.63). The simplest explanation for the increase in desaturation following training is an increase in muscle oxygen consumption due to an increase in mitochondrial content. This results in an increased extraction of delivered oxygen as confirmed by the HHb data. In conclusion, NIRS is able to measure positive training effects on muscle oxygen extraction, at the level of the individual elite athlete.},

abstract = {Sufficient O2-supply to the brain is necessary for an adequate cerebral energy metabolism, function and growth. To elucidate the relation between changes in, respectively, mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and cerebral O2-supply and changes in the oxygenation state of hemoglobin during hypotension in preterm born lambs. Preterm lambs were delivered at 141 days (n=7) or 127 days (n=7) of gestation. Hypotension was induced by stepwise withdrawal of blood. Cerebral arterial blood gases were analyzed at the end of each level to calculate cerebral O2-supply. Near-infrared spectroscopy was used to measure changes in the concentration of cerebral oxyhemoglobin (cO2Hb), deoxyhemoglobin (cHHb) and cHbD (the difference between cO2Hb and cHHb). In the 141 and the 127 d lambs, changes in MABP and cerebral O2-supply were positively linearly related with $\Delta$cO2Hb, and negatively with $\Delta$cHHb. MABP was positively linearly related with changes in cHbD. During hemorrhagic hypotension, changes in MABP and cerebral O2-supply are reflected by changes in the oxygenation state of cerebral hemoglobin in near-term born lambs.},

abstract = {Exercise intolerance is one of the clinical hallmarks of late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD). We studied the acute effects of ERT on the physiological variables associated with exercise tolerance in patients chronically ERT treated. Moreover, we assessed the influence of clinical severity on the investigated variables. The day before (B) and the day after (A) ERT injection, 11 LOPD patients performed on a cycle-ergometer an exercise tolerance test to voluntary exhaustion; VO2, HR, RPE, and GAA activity were determined in B and A. The disease severity was characterized by Walton scale, 6MWT, and pulmonary function tests. No significant differences in the variables related to exercise tolerance were found in A vs B, despite a significant increase in GAA activity in peripheral lymphocytes. No differences in VO2 peak were observed between patients with only skeletal muscle impairment and patients with both skeletal and respiratory muscle impairment. Distance walked at 6MWT was significantly higher than VO2 peak expressed as percentage of normal values. In conclusion, in LOPD patients the exercise tolerance test is not acutely affected by ERT administration; the peripheral muscle component seems more prominent in determining the VO2 peak decrease than the respiratory component; VO2 peak might be more sensitive than 6MWT in estimating exercise tolerance in LOPD.},

abstract = {Background. Walking while performing another task (eg, talking) is challenging for many stroke survivors, yet its neural basis are not fully understood. Objective. To investigate prefrontal cortex activation and its relationship to gait measures while walking under single-task (ST) and dual-task (DT) conditions (ie, walking while simultaneously performing a cognitive task) in stroke survivors. Methods. We acquired near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data from the prefrontal cortex during treadmill walking in ST and DT conditions in chronic stroke survivors and healthy controls. We also acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and NIRS during simulated walking under these conditions. Results. NIRS revealed increased oxygenated hemoglobin concentration in DT-walking compared with ST-walking for both groups. For simulated walking, NIRS showed a significant effect of group and group × task, being greater on both occasions, in stroke survivors. A greater increase in brain activation observed from ST to DT walking/ simulated walking was related to a greater change in motor performance in stroke survivors. fMRI revealed increased activity during DT relative to ST conditions in stroke patients in areas including the inferior temporal gyri, superior frontal gyri and cingulate gyri bilaterally, and the right precentral gyrus. The DT-related increase in fMRI activity correlated with DT-related change in behavior in stroke participants in the bilateral inferior temporal gyrus, left cingulate gyrus, and left frontal pole. Conclusion. Our results provide novel evidence that enhanced brain activity changes relate to dual task motor decrements.},

abstract = {Background: Although the initial anaerobic component of exercise adaptation is unavoidable, no specific functional test is available for use in routine non-sporting practice to evaluate it. Objective: To assess the bioenergetic and biomechanical properties of the Short and Fast Step Test (SFST), which consists of walking up and down a step as many times as possible in 1 minute and to analyse its ability to explore the initial anaerobic component of effort in comparison to a reference self-paced step test. Methods: Overall, 31 healthy subjects (19 women; mean [SD] age, 32.4 [10.2] years) completed a test–retest of a self-paced step test and the SFST, with pre- and post-test measurement of blood lactate concentration and continuous recording of VO2 and modelling of excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC), near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) of the quadriceps and mechanical power (estimated by the number of steps climbed and 3-D motion analysis). Results: Both step tests were well tolerated. The reliability of the bioenergetics parameters, number of raised steps, mechanical power and NIRS tissue saturation index was good. Indirect mechanical power (estimated from number of steps) was correlated with direct power (computed from the centre of mass). Lactate accumulation was significantly increased during exercise with only the SFST (mean [SD] increase, 3.86 [3.26] mmol L−1 from resting values, P < 0.05). EPOC was higher with the SFST than the self-paced step test (P < 0.05). Only the SFST showed significant correlations between number of steps climbed and EPOC (r = 0.84; P < 0.001) and decreased tissue saturation index (NIRS) and EPOC area (r = −0.39; P < 0.05). Conclusions: SFST is feasible, well tolerated, reliable and responsive to explore a brief exercise involving anaerobic metabolism at submaximal intensity. The number of steps taken in 1 minute seems a suitable parameter for practical application.},

abstract = { Previous studies have used supplements to increase dietary nitrate intake in clinical populations. Little is known about whether effects can also be induced through vegetable consumption. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the impact of dietary nitrate, through nitrate-rich vegetables (NRV) and beetroot juice (BRJ) supplementation, on plasma nitrate and nitrite concentrations, exercise tolerance, muscle oxygenation, and cardiovascular function in patients with peripheral arterial disease. In a randomized crossover design, 18 patients with peripheral arterial disease (age: 73 ± 8 years) followed a nitrate intake protocol (∼6.5 mmol) through the consumption of NRV, BRJ, and nitrate-depleted BRJ (placebo). Blood samples were taken, blood pressure and arterial stiffness were measured in fasted state and 150 min after intervention. Each intervention was followed by a maximal walking exercise test to determine claudication onset time and peak walking time. Gastrocnemius oxygenation was measured by near-infrared spectroscopy. Blood samples were taken and blood pressure was measured 10 min after exercise. Mean plasma nitrate and nitrite concentrations increased (nitrate; Time × Intervention interaction; p < .001), with the highest concentrations after BRJ (494 ± 110 $\mu$mol/L) compared with NRV (202 ± 89 $\mu$mol/L) and placebo (80 ± 19 $\mu$mol/L; p < .001). Mean claudication onset time and peak walking time did not differ between NRV (413 ± 187 s and 745 ± 220 s, respectively), BRJ (392 ± 154 s and 746 ± 176 s), and placebo (403 ± 176 s and 696 ± 222 s) ( p = .762 and p = .165, respectively). Gastrocnemius oxygenation, blood pressure, and arterial stiffness were not affected by the intervention. NRV and BRJ intake markedly increase plasma nitrate and nitrite, but this does not translate to improved exercise tolerance, muscle oxygenation, and/or cardiovascular function. },

abstract = {Aims: Objectives During acute bronchial obstruction, the work of breathing increases, while a reduction in perfusion of respiratory muscles due to hyperinflation and/or mechanical constraints may impair the contraction. To test this hypothesis, tissue oxygenation of intercostal muscles was assessed by NIRS in healthy subjects breathing freely or against an expiratory load (EL).Methods: 11 active men (23 ± 2 years) were included in the study. Subjects breathed freely for 5 min in unloaded condition (Ctrl) then for 20 min through a positive EL of 20 cmH2O (Threshold PEP, Respironics). Tissue saturation index (TSI) of intercostal muscle and the changes in concentration of oxy, deoxy and total haemoglobin [O2Hb], [HHb] and [tHb] were measured in the 7th intercostal space by NIRS (Oxymon Mk III, Artinis). Ventilation (VE), O2 uptake and CO2 production (VCO2), (Metamax, Cortex), dyspnea (Borg scale) and pulmonary volumes and capacities (Hyp'Air, Medisoft) were also measured.Results: Tidal volume and VE increased during EL (p{\textless}0.001) while breathing frequency was decreased (p{\textless}0.05). Ti, Ttot, Ti/Ttot and Vt/Te were greater with EL and dyspnea occurred. [tHb] and [O2Hb] were decreased as compared to Ctrl (-5.16 µmol and -3.54 µmol, p{\textless}0.05), [HHb] did not change. TSI was 68 ± 8 {\%} during Ctrl and did not change with EL. RER increased as well as VE/VCO2 (+14.6, p{\textless}0.001); conversely PetCO2 significantly decreased.Conclusions: Tissue saturation index and [O2Hb] were not significantly altered by EL, whereas [tHb] was reduced. Despite this reduction in Hb muscle concentration, the oxygen availability in the intercostal muscles did not seem to be reduced during an acute airway obstruction suggesting an adaptation of blood flow to EL.FootnotesCite this article as: European Respiratory Journal 2018 52: Suppl. 62, PA3359.This is an ERS International Congress abstract.

abstract = {Motor and cognitive tasks often interfere when performed concurrently. The amount of interference typically scales with difficulty of the tasks involved. Thus, supposedly ‘easy' motor tasks with restricted movement amplitude, like sitting on a chair, should show little or no interference with cognitive tasks at all. We measured the processing load induced by different postural tasks and their effect on cognitive performance under cognitive–motor dual-task conditions. Sixteen subjects performed postural motor tasks in three different positions: ‘Lying in a sun lounger', ‘Sitting on a bike saddle', and ‘Upright on feet'. In each position, three different movement instructions were given; ‘Stay stock-still', ‘Relax', ‘Move easily'. Each combination of position and instruction was performed as single task but also in a dual-task condition with a concurrent calculation task. Brain activity in the right prefrontal cortex was monitored using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. The instruction to ‘Stay stock-still' produced higher cortical loads in single-task conditions for all positions compared to all other instructions. The calculation task induced additional brain activity in the same prefrontal area as the motor task. Calculation performance tended to be reduced in the ‘LyingStay stock-still' condition. We discuss the relevance of these findings for learning scenarios in school.},

Setting: Animal laboratory. SUBJECTS: Nine piglets. INTERVENTIONS: Ultrasound dilution cardiac output measurements were performed in ventilated, anesthetized piglets. Interventions that are required for ultrasound dilution cardiac output measurement were evaluated for its effect on cerebral and systemic circulation and oxygenation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN Results: $\Delta$cHbD and $\Delta$ctHb, representing changes in cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume, respectively, were measured with near infrared spectrophotometry. Pulmonary artery (Q) and left carotid artery (Q) blood flow were assessed with transit time flow probes. Starting and/or stopping blood flowing through the arteriovenous loop did not cause relevant hemodynamic changes. Fast injection of isotonic saline caused a biphasic change in $\Delta$cHbD and $\Delta$ctHb. After injection of 0.5 mL/kg, the mean (sd) increase in $\Delta$cHbD and $\Delta$ctHb was 0.175 (0.213) $\mu$mol/L and 0.122 (0.148) $\mu$mol/L, respectively, with a subsequent mean decrease of -0.191 (0.299) $\mu$mol/L and -0.312 (0.266) $\mu$mol/L. Injection of 1.0 mL/kg caused a mean increase in $\Delta$cHbD and $\Delta$ctHb of 0.237 (0.203) $\mu$mol/L and 0.179 (0.162) followed by a mean decrease of -0.334 (0.407) $\mu$mol/L and -0.523 (0.335) $\mu$mol/L, respectively. Q and Q changed shortly with a mean increase of 5.9 (3.0) mL/kg/min and 0.23 (0.10) mL/kg/min after injection of 0.5 mL/kg and with 12.0 (4.2) mL/kg/min and 0.44 (0.18) mL/kg/min after injection of 1.0 mL/kg, respectively. The observed changes were more profound after an injection volume of 1.0 mL/kg compared with 0.5 mL/kg for $\Delta$cHbD (p = .06), $\Delta$ctHb (p = .09), Q, and Q (p < .01). No relevant changes in mean arterial blood pressure or heart rate were detected in response to the indicator injection.

abstract = {Background: The Stroop test is a well-known model to denote the decline in performance under the incongruent condition, which requires selective attention and control of competitive responses. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy can identify activated brain regions associated with the Stroop interference effect. Objective: This research aims to identify the neural correlates associated with the Stroop tasks within the brain activated regions. Materials and Methods: In this cross sectional study, twelve right-handed healthy controls were investigated by means of a multi-channels fNIRS unit during the execution of the Stroop test. Effective connectivity changes in the prefrontal cortex between Stroop attentional conflict and rest states were calculated using DCM approach to investigate (1) areas known for selective attention and (2) analyze internetwork functional connectivity strength (FCS) by selecting several brain functional networks. Results: The results indicated that an increased activity was recorded in the LDLPFC during incongruent condition, while under neutral condition, the increase in activity was even more pronounced in those areas. Effect of Stroop interference associated with significant consistent causes an increase in the RDLPFC to DMPFC, LDLPFC to DMPFC and LDLPFC to RPFC effective connectivity strengths. Conclusion: This study showed the use of DCM algorithm for fNIRS data with respect to fMRI has provided additional information about the directional connectivity and causal interactions in LPFC networks during a conflict processing. Eventually, high temporal resolution fNIRS can be a promising tool for monitoring functional brain activation under the cognitive paradigms in neurological research and psychotherapy applications.},

abstract = {This investigation elucidated the underlying mechanisms of functional impairments in patients with heart failure (HF) by simultaneously comparing cardiaccerebral- muscle hemodynamic and ventilatory responses to exercise among HF patients with various functional capacities. One hundred one patients with HF [New York Heart Association HF functional class II (HF-II, n = 53) and functional class III (HF-III, n = 48) patients] and 71 normal subjects [older control (O-C, n = 39) and younger control (Y-C, n = 32) adults] performed an incremental exercise test using a bicycle ergometer. A recently developed noninvasive bioreactance device was adopted to measure cardiac hemodynamics, and near-infrared spectroscopy was employed to assess perfusions in the frontal cerebral lobe ($\Delta$[THb] FC) and vastus lateralis muscle ($\Delta$ [THb] VL). The results demonstrated that the Y-C group had higher levels of cardiac output, $\Delta$ [THb] FC, and $\Delta$ [THb] VL during exercise than the O-C group. Moreover, these cardiac/peripheral hemodynamic responses to exercise in HF-III group were smaller than those in both HF-II and O-C groups. Although the change of cardiac output caused by exercise was normalized, the amounts of blood distributed to frontal cerebral lobe and vastus lateralis muscle in the HF-III group significantly declined during exercise. The HF-III patients had lower oxygen-uptake efficiency slopes (OUES) and greater V E-VO 2 slopes than the HF-II patients and age-matched controls. However, neither hemodynamic nor ventilatory response to exercise differed significantly between the HF-II and O-C groups. Cardiac output, $\Delta$ [THb] FC, and $\Delta$ [THb] VL during exercise were directly related to the OUES and VO 2peak and inversely related to the V E-VCO 2 slope. Moreover, cardiac output or $\Delta$ [THb] FC was an effect modifier, which modulated the correlation status between $\Delta$ [THb]VL and V E-VCO 2 slope. We concluded that the suppression of cerebral/muscle hemodynamics during exercise is associated with ventilatory abnormality, which reduces functional capacity in patients with HF. {\textcopyright} 2011 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract = {Objective and background: Impaired cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reactivity to hypercapnia during wakefulness at rest as well as reduced exercise tolerance have been reported in severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients. Impaired cerebral oxygenation and hemodynamics can contribute to reduced exercise performance. We hypothesized that (i) OSA patients show impaired cerebrovascular response both during exercise and in response to hypercapnia together with reduced exercise tolerance and (ii) continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment improves these alterations in cerebral oxygenation. Methods: Fifteen OSA patients and 12 healthy matched controls performed a hypercapnic response test and a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test before and after eight weeks of CPAP treatment or control period. Prefrontal cortex and muscle oxygenation were assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during both tests. Results: Cerebrovascular reactivity to hypercapnia was impaired in OSA patients (lower increase in oxyhemoglobin [0.29 ± 0.19 vs 0.44 ± 0.14 $\mu$mol mmHg−1] and total hemoglobin [0.14 ± 0.15 vs 0.26 ± 0.09 $\mu$mol mmHg−1]) compared to controls. Reduced prefrontal cortex oxygen extraction and total blood volume (ie, lower increase in deoxyhemoglobin [1.76 ± 1.57 vs 3.43 ± 2.08 $\mu$mol] and total hemoglobin [5.36 ± 7.08 vs 8.55 ± 5.13 $\mu$mol at exhaustion], respectively) during exercise together with a reduced exercise tolerance (ie, lower peak oxygen consumption) were observed in OSA patients compared to controls. CPAP treatment did not induce any improvement in cerebrovascular response during hypercapnic response test and exercise. Conlusions: This study demonstrates that cerebrovascular response to exercise is altered in OSA and may contribute to exercise intolerance in these patients. Prefrontal cortex oxygenation and exercise tolerance are not significantly improved following eight weeks of CPAP treatment. Clinical trial registration: NCT02854280.},

abstract = {Introduction: As survival of previously considered as lethal congenital heart disease forms is the case in our days, issues regarding quality of life including sport and daily activities emerge. In patients with Fontan circulation, there is no pump to propel blood into the pulmonary arteries since the systemic veins are directly connected to the pulmonary arteries. The complex hemodynamics of Fontan circulation include atrial function, peripheral muscle pump, integrity of the atrioventricular valve, absence of restrictive, or obstructive pulmonary lung function. Therefore, thoracic mechanics are of particular importance within the complex hemodynamics of Fontan circulation. Methods: To understand the physiology of respiratory muscles, the aim of this study was to examine the matching of auxiliary respiratory muscle oxygen delivery and utilization during incremental exercise in young male Fontan patients (n = 22, age = 12.04 ± 2.51) and healthy Controls (n = 10, age = 14.90 ± 2.23). All subjects underwent a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) to exhaustion whereas respiratory muscle oxygenation was measured non-invasively using a near-infrared spectrometer (NIRS). Results: CPET revealed significantly lower peak power output, oxygen uptake and breath activity in Fontan patients. The onset of respiratory muscle deoxygenation was significantly earlier. The matching of local muscle perfusion to oxygen demand was significantly worse in Fontans between 50 and 90% V.O2peak. Findings: The results indicate that (a) there is high strain on respiratory muscles during incremental cycling exercise and (b) auxiliary respiratory muscles are worse perfused in patients who underwent a Fontan procedure compared to healthy Controls. This might be indicative of a more general skeletal muscle strain and worse perfusion in Fontan patients rather than a localized-limited to thoracic muscles phenomenon.},

abstract = {This study tested the hypothesis that muscle blood flow restriction reduces muscle and cerebral oxygenation, at rest. In 26 healthy males, aged 33±2 yrs, physiological variables were continuously recorded during a 10-min period in two experimental conditions: a) with muscle blood flow restriction through thigh cuffs application inflated at 120 mmHg (With Cuffs, WC) and b) without restriction (No Cuffs, NC). Muscle and cerebral oxygenation were reduced by muscle blood flow restriction as suggested by the increase in both muscle and cerebral deoxygenated hemoglobin ($\Delta$[HHb]; p<0.01) and the decrease of muscle and cerebral oxygenation index ($\Delta$[HbDiff]; p<0.01). Hemodynamic responses were not affected by such muscle blood flow restriction, whereas baroreflex sensitivity was reduced (p=0.009). The perception of leg discomfort was higher (p<0.001) in the WC than in the NC condition. This study suggests that thigh cuffs application inflated at 120 mmHg is an effective method to reduce muscle oxygenation at rest. These changes at the muscular level seem to be sensed by the central nervous system, evoking alterations in cerebral oxygenation and baroreflex sensitivity. Novelty bullets: • Thigh cuffs application inflated at 120 mmHg effectively reduces muscle oxygenation at rest. • Limiting muscle oxygenation appears to reduce cerebral oxygenation, and baroreflex sensitivity, at rest. • Even in healthy subjects, limiting muscle oxygenation, at rest, affects neural integration.},

abstract = {Reviews on cardiovascular fitness and cognition in older adults suggest that a higher level of cardiorespiratory fitness may protect the brain against the effects of aging. Although studies reveal positive effects of cardiorespiratory fitness on executive function, more research is needed to clarify the underlying mechanisms of these effects in older adults. The aim of the current study was to assess the association between cardiorespiratory fitness level, cerebral oxygenation, and cognitive performance in older adults (OAs). Seventy-four OAs (68 ± 6.3 years) gave their written, informed consent to participate in the study. Complete data was collected from 66 participants. All participants underwent a cycle ergometer maximal continuous graded exercise test in order to assess their peak power output (PPO) and a neuropsychological paper and pencil tests (Trail Making Test A and B) while changes in left prefrontal cortex oxygenation were measured with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The results reveal increased cardiorespiratory fitness was associated with decreased response time (i.e., better performance) on the Trail Making Test (B) (standardized $\beta$ = − 0.42, p < 0.05). Cerebral oxygenation in higher fit older adults mediated the relationship with improved executive functioning (standardized $\beta$ = − 0.08, p < 0.05). Specifically, in older adults with higher cardiorespiratory fitness (based on a median split), cerebral oxygenation was related to executive functioning but no such relationship existed in lower fit adults.},

abstract = {Sustained attention is fundamental for cognition and when impaired, impacts negatively on important contemporary living skills. Degradation in sustained attention is characterized by the time-on-task (TOT) effect, which manifests as a gradual increase in reaction time (RT). The TOT effect is accompanied by changes in relative brain activity patterns in attention-related areas, most noticeably in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the right parietal areas. However, activity changes in task-relevant motor structures have not been confirmed to date. This article describes an investigation of such motor-related activity changes as measured with 1) the time course of corticospinal excitability (CSE) through single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation; and 2) the changes in activity of premotor (PMC), primary motor (M1), PFC, and right parietal areas by means of near-infrared spectroscopy, during a sustained attention RT task exhibiting the TOT effect. Our results corroborate established findings such as a significant increase (P < 0.05) in lateral prefrontal and right parietal areas activity after the emergence of the TOT effect but also reveal adaptations in the form of motor activity changes - in particular, a significant increase in CSE (P < 0.01) and in primary motor area (M1) activity (P < 0.05).},

abstract = {Background: The study of muscle metabolism by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been poorly implemented in multiple sclerosis (MS). Aims of the study were to compare resting muscle oxygen consumption (rmVO2) at gastrocnemius in MS patients and in age-matched healthy controls (HC) measured using NIRS, and to evaluate its possible relationship with patients' mobility.Methods: Twenty-eight consecutively enrolled MS patients (male, n = 16; age = 42.7 ± 14.0 y, Relapsing-Remitting, n = 19; Primary-Progressive, n = 9) and 22 HC (male, n = 13; age = 36.0 ± 8.2 y) were studied during rest applying the NIRS probes at gastrocnemius, producing a venous occlusion at the thigh using a cuff, and analyzing the slope of the total hemoglobin to calculate rmVO2. Mobility was assessed by a 6-Minute Walking Test and 6-Minute Walking Distance (6MWD) was recorded.Results: rmVO2 was higher in MS compared to HC (0.059 ± 0.038 vs 0.039 ± 0.016 mlO2/min/100 g, P < 0.003), not different in clinical subtypes, not correlated to patients' characteristics (age, disease duration, Expanded Disability Status Scale, resting heart rate, skinfold thickness), and significantly higher in patients with lower walking ability (6MWD < 450 m, n = 12) compared to those at better performance (respectively, 0.072 ± 0.043 vs 0.049 ± 0.032 mlO2/min/100 g, P = 0.03).Conclusion: rmVO2 values, significantly higher in MS patients compared to HC, and in low versus high performing patients, might represent a marker of peripheral adaptations occurred to sustain mobility, as observed in other chronic diseases. {\textcopyright} 2013 Malagoni et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

@thesis{Rissanen2017,
abstract = {Background and aims Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and type 1 diabetes are relatively common endocrinopathies, often manifesting across most of the lifespan. Cardiovascular risk is increased in both PCOS and type 1 diabetes, affecting patients' quality of life and overall prognosis. Acute dynamic exercise is a widely used tool to examine an individual's cardiovascular health. Particularly, peak pulmonary O 2 uptake (V̇ O 2peak ), measured during maximal incremental dynamic exercise and reflecting the highest achievable level of whole-body oxidative metabolism, is a strong and independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This is because V̇ O 2 response to exercise consists of integrated serial steps of systemic O 2 delivery (i.e., pulmonary function, cardiac pump function, blood O 2 carrying capacity), peripheral O 2 delivery (i.e., skeletal muscle blood flow), and peripheral O 2 extraction and utilization (i.e., muscle O 2 diffusion and metabolism). Early identification of potential disease-related derangements in these integrated organ systems would provide important information on clinical manifestations of PCOS and type 1 diabetes; however, studies examining the issue from the integrated perspective have been sparse. Little evidence also exists on effects of long-term exercise training on the signs of the derangements related to type 1 diabetes. The aim of this thesis was to study O 2 delivery and utilization during acute dynamic exercise in both healthy individuals and individuals with PCOS or type 1 diabetes. The adaptations induced by long-term exercise training were also examined in individuals with type 1 diabetes and compared with those in healthy individuals. Acute exercise was thus used as a physiological probe to identify early signs of cardiovascular dysfunction related to the disease states of PCOS and type 1 diabetes, whereas exercise training was employed to demonstrate whether it alleviates such early signs associated with type 1 diabetes. Subjects and methods Studies I-IV of this thesis belonged to a Canadian-Finnish research collaboration entitled “ARTEMIS – Innovation to Reduce Cardiovascular Complications of Diabetes at the Intersection of Discovery, Prevention and Knowledge Exchange”. Data on 22 healthy adult men (Study I), 15 adult overweight or obese women with and 15 without PCOS (Study II), seven adult men with and 10 without type 1 diabetes (Study III), and eight adult men with and eight without type 1 diabetes (Study IV) were included in the final analyses. The groups of Studies II-IV were matched for age, anthropometry, and leisure-time physical activity (II, III) or baseline V̇ O 2peak (IV). Neither PCOS women (II) nor men with type 1 diabetes (III, IV) had clinically overt cardiovascular disease. The subjects performed either maximal incremental treadmill (I) or cycling (II-IV) exercise tests, and in Study IV the subjects did so both before and after a 1-year individualized exercise training intervention. Integrated data were collected during the exercise tests; alveolar gas exchange (volume turbine and mass spectrometry) (I-IV), arterial O 2 saturation (pulse oximetry) (I-IV), heart rate (electrocardiography) (I-IV), 12 cardiac pump function (PhysioFlow impedance cardiography) (II, III), and active leg muscle deoxygenation (I, III, IV) and blood flow (III) (near-infrared spectroscopy [NIRS]), were monitored. In Study I, less active arm muscle and cerebral deoxygenation were also monitored (NIRS). In Study IV, peak O 2 pulse was calculated to indirectly reflect cardiac pump function. Total hemoglobin mass (I) and blood volume (III) were also determined (carbon monoxide rebreathing method), and blood samples were drawn particularly to measure hemoglobin concentration (I-IV) and to evaluate glycemic control (glycosylated hemoglobin A 1c ) (III, IV). Results I: Deoxygenation profiles, reflecting local imbalance between O 2 delivery and utilization, in the tissues of interest were linked to alveolar gas exchange (i.e., whole- body) responses during maximal incremental treadmill exercise in healthy men. II: Reduced V̇ O 2peak , reduced peak systemic O 2 extraction, and a pronounced cardiac response to increasing V̇ O 2 but otherwise intact systemic O 2 delivery were observed in overweight and obese PCOS women. III: Reduced peak cardiac pump function, being associated with reduced blood volume, and independently deteriorated peak active leg muscle blood flow led to reduced V̇ O 2peak and were suggested to be associated with glycosylated hemoglobin A 1c in men with type 1 diabetes. IV: The 1-year training intervention improved V̇ O 2peak and peak O 2 pulse similarly in men with and without type 1 diabetes but had no effect on NIRS-derived local active muscle O 2 extraction or glycosylated hemoglobin A 1c in men with type 1 diabetes. In addition, consistent associations between training dose and responses were observed in healthy men but not in those with type 1 diabetes. Conclusions The findings of this thesis overall highlight the integrated nature of O 2 delivery and utilization responses to acute dynamic exercise. The following conclusions on disease- related early signs of cardiovascular dysfunction can be drawn: In women with excess weight, PCOS per se is linked to alterations in peripheral adjustments to acute dynamic exercise rather than to limitations of systemic O 2 delivery. In type 1 diabetes, both systemic and peripheral cardiovascular impairments, being affected by glycemic control, limit O 2 delivery during acute dynamic exercise. Furthermore, regular exercise training improves V̇ O 2peak and probably cardiac pump function, and hence, improves the overall prognosis of cardiovascular morbidity in type 1 diabetes. However, exercise training, at least to the extent in Study IV, is not able to alleviate diabetes-related defects within active muscle microvasculature or to improve patients' glycemic control. The lack of dose-response associations in men with type 1 diabetes may highlight the need for more individualized exercise regimens in individuals with type 1 diabetes. These conclusions lead future multi-disciplinary research to identify more detailed mechanisms behind, the clinical significance of, and treatment for the observed disease-specific early signs of cardiovascular dysfunction.},

abstract = {Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) has been used to measure muscle mitochondrial capacity. The current method requires as many as 22 short ischemic occlusions to generate a recovery curve for mitochondrial capacity. PURPOSE: To determine the effectiveness of using a 6-occlusion analysis protocol to study muscle mitochondrial capacity. METHOD: Two independent, unidentified data sets were analyzed (bicep n=48, forearm n=41) from previous studies using a NIRS device (Artinis, Ltd.). Both data sets had two recovery tests that included 22 ischemic occlusions. A recovery rate used to indicate mitochondrial capacity was calculated two different ways (simultaneously). Each sample was analyzed with a MATLAB program; with a curve-fit for the 22 ischemic occlusions and curve matching for the first six ischemic cuffs and an end resting value. The two resulting rate constants were compared using correlations, both for the two data sets, good and bad fitting data, using the best 5 of 6 points for the 6 cuff approach. RESULTS: The rate constants were not significantly different between the 22 cmuff and 6 cuff for the total data sets: bicep (1.43+0.32min-1, 1.44+0.35min-1, p=0.56), forearm (1.94+0.42min-1, 1.95+0.44min-1, p=0.76). The average bicep rate constants, when compared to each other, had an equation of y=1.07x-0.09, R2=0.90. The average forearm rate constants, when compared to each other, had an equation of 0.98x+0.02, R2=0.93. CONCLUSIONS: The 6-Cuff analysis provided the same results as the longer 22-cuff. The 6-cuff approach is both shorter in time and uses less ischemic occlusion periods, increasing the practicality of the NIRS mitochondrial capacity test.},

In rodents, exercise training effects can be augmented by large doses of resveratrol supplementation but whether this can occur in humans with a smaller dose is unclear. This study sought to determine the effects of resveratrol supplementation in combination with exercise training on skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity. Sixteen healthy young adults were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to consume either placebo or 500 mg of resveratrol plus 10 mg of piperine, a bioenhancer to increase bioavailibilty and bioefficacy of resveratrol. Participants ingested the pills daily for 4 weeks and completed 3 sessions per week of submaximal endurance training of the wrist flexor muscles of the nondominant arm. The contralateral arm served as an untrained control. Skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy. Changes in mitochondrial capacity from baseline to post-testing indicated significant differences between the resveratrol+piperine-trained arm and the placebo-trained arm (p = 0.02), with the resveratrol+piperine group increasing about 40% from baseline ($\Delta$k = 0.58), while the placebo group increased about 10% from baseline ($\Delta$k = 0.13). Neither the placebo group nor the resveratrol+piperine group exhibited changes in mitochondrial capacity in the untrained arm. In conclusion, low-intensity exercise training can increase forearm skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity when combined with resveratrol and piperine supplementation.},

abstract = {The extent and speed of transient skeletal muscle deoxygenation during exercise onset in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) are related to impairments of local O2 delivery and utilization. This study examined the physiological background of submaximal exercise performance in 19 moderately impaired patients with CHF (Weber class A, B, and C) compared with 19 matched healthy control (HC) subjects by measuring skeletal muscle oxygenation (SmO2) changes during cycling exercise. All subjects performed two subsequent moderate-intensity 6-min exercise tests (bouts 1 and 2) with measurements of pulmonary oxygen uptake kinetics and SmO2 using near-infrared spatially resolved spectroscopy at the vastus lateralis for determination of absolute oxygenation values, amplitudes, kinetics (mean response time for onset), and deoxygenation overshoot characteristics. In CHF, deoxygenation kinetics were slower compared with HC (21.3 ± 5.3 s vs. 16.7 ± 4.4 s, P < 0.05, respectively). After priming exercise (i.e., during bout 2), deoxygenation kinetics were accelerated in CHF to values no longer different from HC (16.9 ± 4.6 s vs. 15.4 ± 4.2 s, P = 0.35). However, priming did not speed deoxygenation kinetics in CHF subjects with a deoxygenation overshoot, whereas it did reduce the incidence of the overshoot in this specific group (P < 0.05). These results provide evidence for heterogeneity with respect to limitations of O2 delivery and utilization during moderate-intensity exercise in patients with CHF, with slowed deoxygenation kinetics indicating a predominant O2 utilization impairment and the presence of a deoxygenation overshoot, with a reduction after priming in a subgroup, indicating an initial O2 delivery to utilization mismatch.},

The disturbed rheological properties of erythrocytes may contribute to circulatory disorders. This study investigated whether EPB with/without anemia influences rheological/hemodynamic functions in patients with HF. Methods: According to the WHO criteria for anemia, 168 HF patients were divided into six groups: non (N)-anemic with (n = 27)/without (n = 56) EPB, light (L)-anemic with (n = 17)/without (n = 21) EPB, and moderate/several (M/S)-anemic with (n = 21)/without (n = 26) EPB groups. These HF patients and 30 healthy counterparts performed an incremental exercise test using a bicycle ergometer. Rheological and hemodynamic characteristics were determined by slit-flow ektacytometer and bioreactance-based device/near infrared spectrometer, respectively. Results: In the HF patients with EPB, both L- and M/S-anemic groups exhibited 1) higher plasma myeloperoxidase/interleukin-6 concentrations, 2) more blood senescent/spherical erythrocyte counts, 3) larger aggregability and smaller deformability of erythrocytes under shear flows, 4) higher systemic vascular resistance, which was accompanied by smaller amounts of blood distributed to cerebral/muscular tissues during exercise, 5) less VO2peak and ventilatory efficiency, and 6) lower Short Form-36 physical/mental component scores and higher Minnesota Living with HF questionnaire score than N-anemic group. Additionally, plasma myeloperoxidase/interleukin-6 levels were directly related to erythrocyte aggregability and inversely related to erythrocyte deformability. However, there were no significant differences in pro-inflammatory factors, rheological/hemodynamic properties, and aerobic capacity between L- and N-anemic groups in the HF patients without EPB. Conclusion: EPB potentiates anemia-related rheological/hemodynamic dysfunctions by elevating pro-inflammatory status, reducing physical fitness in patients with HF. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Currently, oxygen uptake (VO2) is the most precise means of investigating aerobic fitness and level of physical activity; however, VO2 can only be directly measured in supervised conditions. With the advancement of new wearable sensor technologies and data processing approaches, it is possible to accurately infer work rate and predict VO2 during activities of daily living (ADL). The main objective of this study was to develop and verify the methods required to predict and investigate the VO2 dynamics during ADL. The variables derived from the wearable sensors were used to create a predictor based on a random forest method. The VO2 temporal dynamics were assessed by the mean normalized gain amplitude (MNG) obtained from frequency domain analysis. The MNG provides a means to assess aerobic fitness. The predicted VO2 during ADL was strongly correlated (r = 0.87, P < 0.001) with the measured VO2 and the prediction bias was 0.2 ml{\textperiodcentered}min-1 {\textperiodcentered}kg-1. The MNG calculated based on predicted VO2 was strongly correlated (r = 0.71, P < 0.001) with MNG calculated based on measured VO2 data. This new technology provides an important advance in ambulatory and continuous assessment of aerobic fitness with potential for future applications such as the early detection of deterioration of physical health.},

To make this change, intervention methods must be applied. This study determined the hemodynamics of 44 healthy participants and 35 patients with sepsis during exposure to FIR as a novel physical intervention approach. Local microcirculation of their brachioradialis was monitored during exposure and recovery through NIRS. The variations in blood flow and microvascular reaction were determined by conducting paired and unpaired t tests. The oxyhemoglobin levels of the healthy participants increased continuously, even during recovery. In contrast to expextations, the oxyhemoglobin levels of the patients plateaued after only 5 min of FIR illumination. The proposed method has potential applications for ensuring efficient treatment and facilitating doctors in diagnosing the functions of vessels in intensive care units. (Figure presented.) Mapping diagrams of HbO2 in healthy males and males with sepsis illustrated unique scenarios during the process.},

Ten subjects completed three successive 80-min cycling bouts at 45 % of their maximal power output. After the 4-h cycling, maximal voluntary contraction force of the leg was decreased by $\sim$25 %. Muscle exhibited reproductive deoxygenation patterns during each of the three bouts, whereas intra-bout cerebral hemodynamics were different throughout the protocol. Results demonstrate that specific responses to fatiguing exercise are found between tissues but also between cortical sites involved in cycling, as shown by concomitant PFC hyperoxygenation and MC deoxygenation in the first 80 min of exercise.

abstract = {Background: Habituation of postural response to perturbations is impaired in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) due to deficits in cortico-basal pathways. Although transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) modulate cortico-basal networks, it remains unclear if it can benefit postural control in PD. Objective: To analyze the effect of different intensities of anodal tDCS on postural responses and prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity during the habituation to the external perturbation in patients with PD (n = 24). Methods: Anodal tDCS was applied over the primary motor cortex (M1) with 1 mA, 2 mA, and sham stimulation in 3 different sessions ($\sim$2 weeks apart) during 20 minutes immediately before the postural assessment. External perturbation (7 trials) was applied by a support base posterior translation (20 cm/s and 5 cm). Primary outcome measures included lower limb electromyography and center of pressure parameters. Measures of PFC activity are reported as exploratory outcomes. Analyses of variance (Stimulation Condition × Trial) were performed. Results: Habituation of perturbation was evidenced independent of the stimulation conditions. Both active stimulation intensities had shorter recovery time and a trend for lower cortical activity in the stimulated hemisphere when compared to sham condition. Shorter onset latency of the medial gastrocnemius as well as lower cortical activity in the nonstimulated hemisphere were only observed after 2 mA concerning the sham condition. Conclusions: tDCS over M1 improved the postural response to external perturbation in PD, with better response observed for 2 mA compared with 1 mA. However, tDCS seems to be inefficient in modifying the habituation of perturbation.},

abstract = {Objective: At this moment, a wake-up test needs to be done when amplitudes of TES-MEP monitoring decrease irreversible during scoliosis surgery, what mostly turns out to be a false-positive. To make TES-MEP measurements more reliable, we need to know what causes variability in TES-MEP amplitudes and how to diminish this variability. There is an in- dication that MAP is related to these variability's. The aim of this study was to improve IONM during scoliosis surgery by examining change in blood pressure in relation to cerebral oxygenation, measured with NIRS, as a possible cause of change in cortical excitability and therefore, vari- ability in TES-MEP amplitudes. Methods: Seven healthy subjects participated in a pilot study. MAP and NIRS were measured during this. Four interventions were executed to vary MAP of each subject: 1) valsalva manoeuvre, 2) handgrip exercise, 3) hip anteversion and 4) tilttable test. EtCO2 is also measured to monitor its influence on cerebral oxygenation. Data of MAP, oxygenation and EtCO2 were analysed by Microsoft Excel, Matlab 2014a and IBM SPSS Statistics 21. Results: The results of the handgrip exercise show a significant cor- relation between MAP and oxygenation (rs = 0.893, P<0.01). There was no significant differ in MAP and oxygenation. Hip anteversion shows no significant correlation between MAP and oxygenation (rs = -0.107, P<0.05). There was also no significant differ in MAP and oxygenation. The tilttable test and valsalva manoeuvre were excluded. Conclusion: Blood pressure is related to cerebral oxygenation, but further research needs to be done to correlate oxygenation to the variabil- ity in TES-MEP},

abstract = {Background: The integrative physiological effects of O2 treatment on patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) during exercise, have not been fully investigated. We simultaneously evaluated, for the first time, the effect of oxygen supplementation on hemodynamic responses, autonomic modulation, tissue oxygenation, and exercise performance in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)/Chronic Thromboembolic PH(CTEPH). Material-methods: In this randomized, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial, stable outpatients with PAH/CTEPH underwent maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing, followed by two submaximal trials, during which they received supplementary oxygen (O2) or medical-air. Continuous, non-invasive hemodynamics were monitored via photophlythesmography. Cerebral and quadriceps muscle oxygenation were recorded via near-infrared spectroscopy. Autonomic function was assessed by heart rate variability; root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) and standard-deviation-Poincare-plot (SD1) were used as indices of parasympathetic output. Baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS) was assessed throughout the protocols. Results: Nine patients (51.4 ± 9.4 years) were included. With O2-supplementation patients exercised for longer (p = 0.01), maintained higher cerebral oxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb;p = 0.02) levels, exhibited an amelioration in cortical deoxygenation (HHb;p = 0.02), and had higher average cardiac output (CO) during exercise (p < 0.05), compared to medical air; with no differences in muscle oxygenation. With O2-supplementation patients exhibited higher BRS and sample-entropy throughout the protocol (p < 0.05) vs. medical air, and improved the blunted RMSSD, SD1 responses during exercise (p = 0.024). Conclusion: We show that O2 administration improves BRS and autonomic function during submaximal exercise in PAH/CTEPH, without significantly affecting muscle oxygenation. The improved autonomic function, along with enhancements in cardiovascular function and cerebral oxygenation, probably contributes to increased exercise tolerance with O2-supplementation in PH patients.},

These non-invasive technologies have been widely used to solve the propagation of light inside the tissues including the absorption, scattering coefficient and to quantify the oxygenation level of haemoglobin and myoglobin in human muscle. The goal of this paper is to optimize the measurement of muscle oxygen saturation during isometric exercise using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The experiment was carried out on 15 sedentary healthy male volunteers. All volunteers are required to perform an isometric exercise at three assessment of muscular fatigue's level on flexor digitalis (FDS) muscle in the human forearm using fNIRS. The slopes of the signals have been highlighted to evaluate the muscle oxygen saturation of regional muscle fatigue. As a result, oxygen saturation slope from 10% exercise showed steeper than the first assessment at 30%-50% of fatigues level. The hemodynamic signal response showed significant value (p=0.04) at all three assessment of muscular fatigue's level which produce a p-value (p<0.05) measured by fNIRS. Thus, this highlighted parameter could be used to estimate fatigue's level of human and could open other possibilities to study muscle performance diagnosis.},

abstract = {Purpose: Aortic stiffness may affect shear patterns in the peripheral vasculature. This study examined if sprint exercise, which typically increases aortic stiffness is associated with increased peripheral retrograde blood flow and impaired microvascular function. Methods: Twenty participants (10 women; age: 27 ± 5 years) underwent arterial stiffness, shear rate, and microvascular function assessment at three time points: baseline; following time control; $\sim$ 2 min post a 30-s cycle ergometer sprint against 7.0% body mass. Aortic stiffness was assessed using carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV). Superficial femoral artery (SFA) diameter and blood velocity were assessed using Doppler-ultrasound and were used to calculate shear rates and resistance index (RI). SFA wave reflections were obtained via wave intensity analysis. Vastus medialis microvascular function was measured as tissue saturation index reactivity pre-post exercise via near-infrared spectroscopy. Results: cfPWV increased by + 0.8 ± 0.7 m{\textperiodcentered}s−1 following exercise (p < 0.001). Retrograde shear was reduced following exercise compared with time control (− 4.9 ± 3.8 s−1; p < 0.001), while tissue saturation index was increased post-exercise from baseline (+ 2.3 ± 4.6%; p = 0.04). Reductions in SFA wave reflections (− 1.70 ± 1.96 aU) and RI (− 0.17 ± 0.13 aU) were also noted following exercise (p < 0.001). Conclusion: These data suggest sprint exercise-mediated changes in peripheral shear patterns and microvascular function in the exercised vasculature occur independent from increases in aortic stiffness. Exercise-induced reductions in SFA retrograde shear may be related to decreased wave reflections and peripheral vascular resistance.},

Previous studies were performed with a 1-2 Hz temporal resolution and a poor signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio. The aim of this study was to investigate the response of the motor cortex region during a finger opposition task in single subjects using a novel continuous wave NIRS instrument with enhanced temporal resolution and S/N ratio. Six subjects performed a sequential finger opposition task with the right hand (20 s duration; 2 Hz). The optodes were positioned over the left motor cortex region using an inter-optode distance of 3.5 cm. The high S/N ratio and 0.1 s sampling time allowed clear monitoring of [O 2 Hb] and [HHb]  changes due to heart beat as well as to respiration. The contribution of the heart pulse to the total signal was less than 0.4%. As previously shown by others using pooled data, an increase of [O 2 Hb] during the activation accompanied by a decrease of [HHb]  was found in most subjects for every activation cycle. Our approach provides a better insight into the underlying physiological mechanisms.},

abstract = {This study examined the influence of muscle deoxygenation and reoxygenation on repeated-sprint performance via manipulation of O2 delivery. Fourteen team-sport players performed 10 10-s sprints (30-s recovery) under normoxic (NM: FIO2 0.21) and acute hypoxic (HY: FIO2 0.13) conditions in a randomized, single-blind fashion and crossover design. Mechanical work was calculated and arterial O2 saturation (SpO2) was estimated via pulse oximetry for every sprint. Muscle deoxyhemoglobin concentration ([HHb]) was monitored continuously by near-infrared spectroscopy. Differences between NM and HY data were analyzed for practical significance using magnitude-based inferences. HY reduced SpO2 (-10.7±1.9%, with chances to observe a higher/similar/lower value in HY of 0/0/100%) and mechanical work (-8.2±2.1%; 0/0/100%). Muscle deoxygenation increased during sprints in both environments, but was almost certainly higher in HY (12.5±3.1%, 100/0/0%). Between-sprint muscle reoxygenation was likely more attenuated in HY (-11.1±11.9%; 2/7/91%). The impairment in mechanical work in HY was very largely correlated with HY-induced attenuation in muscle reoxygenation (r=0.78, 90% confidence limits: 0.49; 0.91). Repeated-sprint performance is related, in part, to muscle reoxygenation capacity during recovery periods. These results extend previous findings that muscle O2 availability is important for prolonged repeated-sprint performance, in particular when the exercise is taken in hypoxia. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.},

abstract = {Musculoskeletal pain is one of the most common causes of chronic pain. Exercise- based pain management programs have been suggested as an effective alternative for relieving from musculoskeletal pain; however the pain which is experienced after unaccustomed, especially eccentric exercise (ECC) can alter people´s ability or willingness to participate in therapeutic exercises or sports. Subsequent muscle pain and tenderness after ECC, most commonly known as delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS), has been shown to cause localized pressure pain, hyperalgesia and to decrease the muscle performance. A prior bout of ECC has been repeatedly reported to produce a protective adaptation known as repeated bout effect (RBE). There is no prior study, to our knowledge, investigating the effect of DOMS and RBE concomitantly on the sensitivity of the nociceptive system, blood supply, and functional capacity in healthy subjects. One of the main scopes of the current project was to investigate the adaptations by which the RBE can be resulted from. The approach in the current study was to use exercise induced- muscle damage followed by ECC exercise as an endogenous acute pain model and observe its effects on the sensitivity of the nociceptive system, blood supply, and functional capacity in healthy subjects. Then, the effect of a repeated bout of the same exercise as a healthy pain relief strategy on these parameters was assessed. This dissertation indicated that high intensity unaccustomed ECC can lead to central sensitization depicted by lower nociceptive withdrawal reflex threshold. Central sensitization induced by an initial ECC probably demonstrates a mechanism for the tenderness in the muscle and pain during movement. A lack of central sensitization is seen after the repeated bouts of ECC irrespective if the initial bout of ECC involved the ipsi- or the contralateral limb. The protective effects regarding RBE to the contralateral limb are specific to the contralateral homologous innervation level. Muscle oxygen re-perfusion can be improved after a single bout of high intensity damaging ECC; however it does not play a major role in cross-transfer adaptations due to repeated bouts of ECC},

abstract = {Background: The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is involved with allocating attentional resources to maintain postural control. However, it is unknown whether age-related structural and functional declines of the DLPFC may impair postural control during sensory manipulation. In this study, we aim to understand the effects of aging on the DLPFC when sensory cues were removed or presented inaccurately (i.e., increased sensory complexity) during the sensory orientation test (SOT). Methods: Twenty young (18–25 years) and 18 older (66–73 years) healthy adults were recruited to undertake the SOT, which consisted of six conditions aimed at removing or disrupting the visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive senses. During these six SOT conditions, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), consisting of eight transmitter-receiver optode pairs (four channels over the left and right DLPFC), was used to measure hemodynamic responses (i.e., changes in oxy- [O2Hb] and deoxyhemoglobin [HHb]) from the bilateral DLPFC. Results: Our results show an increase in bilateral DLPFC activation (i.e., increase in O2Hb and concomitant smaller decrease in HHb) with increasing sensory complexity in both young and older adults. The increase in left and right DLPFC activation during more complex sensory conditions was greater, which was concomitant with reduced balance performance in older adults compared to younger adults. Furthermore, we observed a right lateralized DLPFC activation in younger adults. Finally, a significant positive association was observed between balance performance and increased bilateral DLPFC activation particularly for SOT conditions with greater sensory disruptions. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the involvement of the DLPFC in maintaining postural control, particularly during complex sensory tasks, and provide direct evidence for the role of the DLPFC during postural control of a clinically relevant measure of balance.},

In order to determine the level of bilateral SMC activation during the SFS task, an Oxymon MkIII fNIRS system was used to measure from the left and right SMC, changes in oxygenated (O2Hb) and deoxygenated (HHb) haemoglobin concentration values. The fNIRS data suggests a finding that compared to the Pre condition both the “Online” and “Offline” anodal HD-tDCS conditions induced a significant reduction in bilateral SMC activation (i.e., smaller decrease in HHb) for a similar motor output (i.e., SFS tap rate). These findings could be related to anodal HD-tDCS inducing a greater efficiency of neuronal transmission in the bilateral SMC to perform the same SFS task.},

abstract = {Stroke is the leading cause of severe chronic disability and the second cause of death worldwide with 15 million new cases and 50 million stroke survivors. The poststroke chronic disability may be ameliorated with early neuro rehabilitation where non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques can be used as an adjuvant treatment to hasten the effects. However, the heterogeneity in the lesioned brain will require individualized NIBS intervention where innovative neuroimaging technologies of portable electroencephalography (EEG) and functional-near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can be leveraged for Brain State Dependent Electrotherapy (BSDE). In this hypothesis and theory article, we propose a computational approach based on excitation-inhibition (E-I) balance hypothesis to objectively quantify the poststroke individual brain state using online fNIRS-EEG joint imaging. One of the key events that occurs following Stroke is the imbalance in local E-I (that is the ratio of Glutamate/GABA), which may be targeted with NIBS using a computational pipeline that includes individual "forward models" to predict current flow patterns through the lesioned brain or brain target region. The current flow will polarize the neurons, which can be captured with E-I-based brain models. Furthermore, E-I balance hypothesis can be used to find the consequences of cellular polarization on neuronal information processing, which can then be implicated in changes in function. We first review the evidence that shows how this local imbalance between E-I leading to functional dysfunction can be restored in targeted sites with NIBS (motor cortex and somatosensory cortex) resulting in large-scale plastic reorganization over the cortex, and probably facilitating recovery of functions. Second, we show evidence how BSDE based on E-I balance hypothesis may target a specific brain site or network as an adjuvant treatment. Hence, computational neural mass model-based integration of neurostimulation with online neuroimaging systems may provide less ambiguous, robust optimization of NIBS, and its application in neurological conditions and disorders across individual patients.},

abstract = {Continuous measurements of haemodynamic and oxygenation changes in free living animals remain elusive. However, developments in biomedical technologies may help to fill this knowledge gap. One such technology is continuous-wave near-infrared spectroscopy (CW-NIRS)—a wearable and non-invasive optical technology. Here, we develop a marinized CW-NIRS system and deploy it on elite competition freedivers to test its capacity to function during deep freediving to 107 m depth. We use the oxyhaemoglobin and deoxyhaemoglobin concentration changes measured with CW-NIRS to monitor cerebral haemodynamic changes and oxygenation, arterial saturation and heart rate. Furthermore, using concentration changes in oxyhaemoglobin engendered by cardiac pulsation, we demonstrate the ability to conduct additional feature exploration of cardiac-dependent haemodynamic changes. Freedivers showed cerebral haemodynamic changes characteristic of apnoeic diving, while some divers also showed considerable elevations in venous blood volumes close to the end of diving. Some freedivers also showed pronounced arterial deoxygenation, the most extreme of which resulted in an arterial saturation of 25%. Freedivers also displayed heart rate changes that were comparable to diving mammals both in magnitude and patterns of change. Finally, changes in cardiac waveform associated with heart rates less than 40 bpm were associated with changes indicative of a reduction in vascular compliance. The success here of CW-NIRS to non-invasively measure a suite of physiological phenomenon in a deep-diving mammal highlights its efficacy as a future physiological monitoring tool for human freedivers as well as free living animals.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Evaluation of skeletal muscle oxidative capacity in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and its relationship with measures of walking disability. METHODS: Muscle oxidative capacity was measured in an MS and control (CON) group with near- infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during repeated arterial occlusions to assess rate of recovery of muscle oxygen consumption in both gastrocnemius muscles after exercise. Walking disability was assessed by a timed 25-ft walk and fatigue questionnaires. RESULTS: Oxidative capacity on average was lower in the MS group compared to CON group (1.13 ± 0.29 vs. 1.68 ± 0.37 min-1, p < 0.05). 25-ft walk time was slower in patients with MS compared to CON group (3.72 ± 0.40 vs. 8.50 ± 6.23 sec, p < 0.05). The participants with MS who used an assistive device during the 25-ft walk test walked significantly slower than those who used no assistive device (p < 0.01). Significant correlations were found between oxidative capacity in the self-reported most-affected leg and percent difference between oxidative capacity of the self-reported most-affected and least-affected legs and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale questionnaire total and physical score. CONCLUSION: NIRS measurements of oxidative capacity suggest a 40% deficit in people with MS compared to healthy controls, consistent with previous studies using 31P MRS. Preliminary evidence suggest the magnitude of bilateral oxidative capacity deficits may be a bimodal indicator of walking dysfunction.},

AltitudeOmics: on the consequences of high-altitude acclimatization for the development of fatigue during locomotor exercise in humans. J Appl Physiol 115: 634-642, 2013. First published June 27, 2013; doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.00606. 2013.-The development of muscle fatigue is oxygen (O2)-delivery sensitive [arterial O2 content (CaO2) × limb blood flow (QL)]. Locomotor exercise in acute hypoxia (AH) is, compared with sea level (SL), associated with reduced CaO2 and exaggerated inspiratory muscle work (Winsp), which impairs QL, both of which exacerbate fatigue individually by compromising O2 delivery. Since chronic hypoxia (CH) normalizes CaO2 but exacerbates Winsp, we investigated the consequences of a 14-day exposure to high altitude on exercise-induced locomotor muscle fatigue. Eight subjects performed the identical constant-load cycling exercise (138 ± 14 W; 11 ± 1 min) at SL (partial pressure of inspired O2, 147.1 ± 0.5 Torr), in AH (73.8 ± 0.2 Torr), and in CH (75.7 ± 0.1 Torr). Peripheral fatigue was expressed as pre- to postexercise percent reduction in electrically evoked potentiated quadriceps twitch force ( $\Delta$Qtw,pot). Central fatigue was expressed as the exercise-induced percent decrease in voluntary muscle activation ($\Delta$VA). Resting CaO2 at SL and CH was similar, but CaO2 in AH was lower compared with SL and CH (17.3 ± 0.5, 19.3 ± 0.7, 20.3 ± 1.3 ml O2/dl, respectively). Winsp during exercise increased with acclimatization (SL: 387 ± 36, AH: 503 ± 53, CH: 608 ± 67 cmH2O{\textperiodcentered}s -1{\textperiodcentered}min-1; P < 0.01). Exercise at SL did not induce central or peripheral fatigue. $\Delta$Qtw,pot was significant but similar in AH and CH (21 ± 2% and 19 ± 3%; P < 0.24). $\Delta$VA was significant in both hypoxic conditions but smaller in CH vs. AH (4 ± 1% vs. 8 ± 2%; P < 0.05). In conclusion, acclimatization to severe altitude does not attenuate the substantial impact of hypoxia on the development of peripheral fatigue. In contrast, acclimatization attenuates, but does not eliminate, the exacerbation of central fatigue associated with exercise in severe AH.

abstract = {Purpose: In this study, we investigated the effects of vibration of the whole lower leg on the content and the oxygenation of hemoglobin in the unloaded relaxed lateral gastrocnemius muscle. Vibration was applied orthogonal to and in parallel with leg axis to examine whether the extrusion of blood depends on an alignment of main vessel direction, axis of vibration and gravity. Method: The blood volume in the muscles was altered by horizontal and 30° upright body posture. Fifteen male subjects were exposed to 4 sets of experiments with both vibration directions and both tilt angles applied in permutated order. The absence of voluntary muscular activity and the potential occurrence of compound action potentials by stretch reflexes were monitored using electromyography. Total hemoglobin and tissue saturation index were measured with near infrared spectroscopy. Changes of lower leg circumference were measured with strain gauge system placed around the calf. Result: Vibration caused decrease in tHb and increase in TSI indicating extrusion of predominantly venous blood from the muscle. In 30° tilted position, muscles contained more blood at baseline and vibration ejected more blood from the muscle compared with horizontal posture (p < 0.01). At 30° tilting deeper drop in tHb and steeper increase in TSI (p < 0.01) were observed when vibration was applied in parallel with the length axis of muscle. Conclusion: It is concluded that the vibration extrudes more blood in 30° head up posture and the vibration applied in parallel with the length axis of the muscle is more effective than orthogonal vibration.},

abstract = {Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is used for preventing muscle atrophy and improving muscle strength in patients and healthy people. However, the current intensity of NMES is usually set at a level that causes the stimulated muscles to contract. This typically causes pain. Quantifying the instantaneous changes in muscle microcirculation and metabolism during NMES before muscle contraction occurs is crucial, because it enables the current intensity to be optimally tuned, thereby reducing the NMES-induced muscle pain and fatigue. We applied near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to measure instantaneous tissue oxygenation and deoxygenation changes in 43 healthy young adults during NMES at 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 mA. Having been stabilized at the NIRS signal baseline, the tissue oxygenation and total hemoglobin concentration increased immediately after stimulation in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05) until stimulation was stopped at the level causing muscle contraction without pain. Tissue deoxygenation appeared relatively unchanged during NMES. We conclude that NIRS can be used to determine the optimal NMES current intensity by monitoring oxygenation changes.},

abstract = {Background: Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) improves haemodynamics in peripheral arterial disease (PAD), but its effects on foot perfusion were scarcely studied. In severe PAD patients we measured the foot oxygenation changes evoked by a novel intermittent IPC device (GP), haemodynamics and compliance to the treatment. Reference values were obtained by a sequential foot-calf device (SFC).Methods: Twenty ischemic limbs (Ankle-Brachial Index = 0.5 ± 0.2) of 12 PAD patients (7 male, age: 74.5 ± 10.8 y) with an interval of 48 ± 2 hours received a 35 minute treatment in supine position with two IPC devices: i) a Gradient Pump (GP), which slowly inflates a single thigh special sleeve and ii) an SFC (ArtAssist{\textregistered}, ACI Medical, San Marcos, CA, USA), which rapidly inflates two foot-calf sleeves. Main outcome measure: changes of oxygenated haemoglobin at foot (HbO2foot) by continuous near-infrared spectroscopy recording and quantified as area-under-curve (AUC) for periods of 5 minutes. Other measures: haemodynamics by echo-colour Doppler (time average velocity (TAV) and blood flow (BF) in the popliteal artery and in the femoral vein), patient compliance by a properly developed form.Results: All patients completed the treatment with GP, 9 with SFC. HbO2foot during the working phase, considered as average value of the 5 minutes periods, increased with GP (AUC 458 ± 600 to 1216 ± 280) and decreased with SFC (AUC 231 ± 946 to -1088 ± 346), significantly for most periods (P < 0.05). The GP treatment was associated to significant haemodynamic changes from baseline to end of the treatment (TAV = 10.2 ± 3.3 to 13.5 ± 5.5 cm/sec, P = 0.004; BF = 452.0 ± 187.2 to 607.9 ± 237.8 ml/sec, P = 0.0001), not observed with SFC (TAV = 11.2 ± 3.4 to 11.8 ± 4.3 cm/sec; BF = 513.8 ± 203.7 to 505.9 ± 166.5 ml/min, P = n.s.). GP obtained a higher score of patient compliance (P < 0.0001).Conclusions: A novel IPC thigh device, unlike a traditional SFC device, increased foot oxygenation in severe PAD, together with favourable haemodynamic response and high compliance to the treatment under the present experimental conditions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Manfredini et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Twelve healthy, trained cyclists (n = 2 females, n = 10 males; age = 35 [12] years; height = 177 [7] cm; mass = 75.2 [11.0] kg; VO2max = 55 [6] ml{\textperiodcentered}kg−1{\textperiodcentered}min−1) were randomized to supplement with 60 g of DC or placebo twice per day for 14 days in a double-blind crossover study. After the 2 weeks of supplementation, the participants attended a laboratory session in which they consumed 120 g of DC or placebo and then cycled for 90 min at 50% peak power output, followed immediately by a 10-km time trial (TT) at simulated altitude (15% O2). The plasma concentration of blood glucose and lactate were measured before and at 15, 30, 60, and 90 min during the steady-state exercise and post TT, while muscular and prefrontal cortex oxygenation was measured continuously throughout exercise using near-infrared spectroscopy. DC resulted in a higher concentration of blood glucose (5.5 [0.5] vs. 5.3 [0.9] mmol/L) throughout the trial and lower blood lactate concentration following the TT (7.7 [1.92] vs. 10.0 [4.6] mmol/L) compared with the placebo. DC had no effect on the TT performance (19.04 [2.16] vs. 19.21 ± 1.96 min) or oxygenation status in either the prefrontal cortex or muscle. The authors conclude that, although it provided some metabolic benefit, DC is not effective as an ergogenic aid during TT cycling at simulated altitude.},

Recently, there has been a growing interest in using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to elucidate the neural basis of cognitive and socioemotional development and identify the factors shaping these types of development. This article, focusing on the fNIRS methods, presents an up-to-date systematic review of fNIRS studies addressing the effects of age and other factors on brain functions in children and adolescents. Literature searches were conducted using PubMed and PsycINFO. A total of 79 fNIRS studies involving healthy individuals aged 3–17 years that were published in peer-reviewed journals in English before July 2020 were included. Six methodological aspects of these studies were evaluated, including the research design, experimental paradigm, fNIRS measurement, data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and result presentation. The risk of bias, such as selective outcome reporting, was assessed throughout the review. A qualitative synthesis of study findings in terms of the factor effects on changes in oxyhemoglobin concentration was also performed. This unregistered review highlights the strengths and limitations of the existing literature and suggests directions for future research to facilitate the improved use of fNIRS in developmental cognitive neuroscience research.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine oxygen consumption (VO2) during isometric exercise in human muscles using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The technique was used to study the relationship between VO2 in the soleus muscle and the level of isometric exercise expressed as percentages of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). For the study 11 healthy male volunteers were recruited. Reproducibility was studied in 6 subjects. The subjects were seated in a chair with the knee joint at an angle of 90°. The optodes of the NIRS instrument were attached to the lateral aspect of the soleus muscle. A horizontal bar above the knee was connected to a dynamometer. Subjects applied isometric force to the bar by producing a torque at the ankle joint. Firstly the MVC was determined. Secondly the VO2 at rest and at 5 levels of isometric exercise, ranging from 5% to 25% of MVC and increasing by 5% each stage, was measured. In all cases the VO2 at rest or during isometric contraction was determined from the decrease of the oxyhaemoglobin (O2Hb) signal immediately after arterial occlusion of the thigh. Repeated measurements showed no significant difference between trials, indicating that the measurements were reproducible. At rest a VO2 of 6.7 ± 1.1 $\mu$MO2Hb min‐1 (mean ± S.E.M.) was found, a result comparable with other studies. In all subjects a linear relationship was found between the VO2 and the level of exercise. The average slope of the regression lines of all individuals was 0.85 ± 0.22 $\mu$uMO, Hb min‐1 MVC‐1 (mean ± S.E.M.). Inter‐individual variation of the slopes was high and ranged from 0.28 to 2.29 $\mu$uMO2 Hb‐ min‐1 %MVC‐1, which can be explained by differences in fat percentage and in the measuring volume of the NIRS instrument. NIRS appeared to be a reproducible and reliable method for the non‐invasive measurement of VO2 in human muscles. The method could be used to investigate regional differences as well as changes in time between muscle groups as a function of training. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1995 Acta Anaesthesiol Scand},

abstract = {Dietary nitrate (NO 3− ) supplementation via beetroot juice (BR) is known to improve endurance performance in untrained and moderately trained individuals. However, conflicting results exist in well-trained individuals. Evidence suggests that the effects of NO 3− are augmented during conditions of reduced oxygen availability (e.g., hypoxia), thereby increasing the probability of performance improvements for well-trained athletes in hypoxia vs. normoxia. This randomized, double-blinded, counterbalanced-crossover study examined the effects of 7 days of BR supplementation with 12.4 mmol NO 3− per day on 10-km cycling time trial (TT) performance in 12 well-trained cyclists in normoxia (N) and normobaric hypoxia (H). Linear mixed models for repeated measures revealed increases in plasma NO 3− and NO 2− after supplementation with BR (both p < 0.001). Further, TT performance increased with BR supplementation (∼1.6%, p < 0.05), with no difference between normoxia and hypoxia (p = 0.92). For respiratory variables there were significant effects of supplementation on VO 2 (p < 0.05) and VE (p < 0.05) such that average VO 2 and VE during the TT increased with BR, with no difference between normoxia and hypoxia (p ≥ 0.86). We found no effect of supplementation on heart rate, oxygen saturation or muscle oxygenation during the TT. Our results provide new evidence that chronic high-dose NO 3− supplementation improves cycling performance of well-trained cyclists in both normoxia and hypoxia.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate local muscle O2 consumption (muscVO2) and forearm blood flow (FBF) in resting and exercising muscle by use of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and to compare the results with the global muscVO2 and FBF derived from the well-established Fick method and plethysmography. muscVO2 was derived from 1) NIRS using venous occlusion, 2) NIRS using arterial occlusion, and 3) the Fick method [muscVO2(Fick)]. FBF was derived from 1) NIRS and 2) strain-gauge plethysmography. Twenty-six healthy subjects were tested at rest and during sustained isometric handgrip exercise. Local variations were investigated with two independent and simultaneously operating NIRS systems at two different muscles and two measurement depths. muscVO2 increased more than fivefold in the active flexor digitorum superficialis muscle, and it increased 1.6 times in the brachioradialis muscle. The average increase in muscVO2(Fick) was twofold. FBF increased 1.4 times independent of the muscle or the method. It is concluded that NIRS is an appropriate tool to provide information about local muscVO2 and local FBF because both place and depth of the NIRS measurements reveal local differences that are not detectable by the more established, but also more global, Fick method.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine O 2 uptake (VO 2) on-kinetics when the spontaneous blood flow (and therefore O 2 delivery) onresponse was slowed by 25 and 50 s. The isolated gastrocnemius muscle complex (GS) in situ was studied in six anesthetized dogs during transitions from rest to a submaximal metabolic rate (̃50- 70% of peak VO 2). Four trials were performed: 1) a pretrial in which resting and steady-state blood flows were established, 2) a control trial in which the blood flow on-kinetics mean response time (MRT) was set at 20 s (CT20), 3) an experimental trial in which the blood flow on-kinetics MRT was set at 45 s (EX45), and 4) an experimental trial in which the blood flow on-kinetics MRT was set at 70 s (EX70). Slowing O 2 delivery via slowing blood flow on-kinetics resulted in a linear slowing of the VO 2 on-kinetics response (R = 0.96). Average MRT values for CT20, EX45, and EX70 VO 2 on-kinetics were (means ± SD) 17 ± 2, 23 ± 4, and 26 ± 3 s, respectively (P < 0.05 among all). During these transitions, slowing blood flow resulted in greater muscle deoxygenation (as indicated by near-infrared spectroscopy), suggesting that lower intracellular PO 2 values were reached. In this oxidative muscle, VO 2 and O 2 delivery were closely matched during the transition period from rest to steady-state contractions. In conjunction with our previous work showing that speeding O 2 delivery did not alter VO 2 on-kinetics under similar conditions, it appears that spontaneously perfused skeletal muscle operates at the nexus of sufficient and insufficient O 2 delivery in the transition from rest to contractions.

abstract = {Aim/Hypothesis: This cross-sectional, observational, controlled study examined cerebral oxygenation during exercise, an index of cerebrovascular function and cortical activation, in pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and unaffected pregnancies. The association of cerebral oxygenation with macrovascular and cardiovascular function indices was also evaluated. Material and Methods: Vascular function and structure [aortic pulse-wave-velocity (PWV), augmentation index (AI), carotid intima-media thickness], as well as 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) were assessed in women with GDM (n = 21) and uncomplicated pregnancies (n = 16), at 26–32 gestational weeks. Changes in cerebral oxygenation [oxy- (O2Hb), deoxy- (HHb) and total- (tHb) hemoglobin] were continuously recorded by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during intermittent handgrip exercise. Beat-by-beat BP and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) were assessed (Finapres). Results: Women with GDM had higher AI than controls. During exercise, women with GDM maintained a smaller force (p < 0.05), despite similar ratings of perceived exertion. Despite similar increases in BP during exercise, the GDM group exhibited a lower average and total (AUC) increase in cerebral-O2Hb than controls (p < 0.05). In addition, GDM exhibited a slower rate of cerebral-O2Hb decay during recovery (p < 0.05). SVR was lower in GDM compared to controls throughout the protocol (p < 0.01). Cerebral oxygenation indices were correlated with PWV and AI (p < 0.05). Conclusions: This study provided novel evidence for blunted cerebral oxygenation during exercise in women with GDM compared to uncomplicated pregnancies, suggesting a link between reduced cerebrovascular function with exercise intolerance in GDM. Cerebral oxygenation during physical stress was correlated with macrovascular function and cardiovascular risk factors. More studies are needed to examine whether this impaired cerebral oxygenation reflects early cerebrovascular disease.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study was t.compare the development and etiology of neuromuscular fatigue of the knee extensor (KE) and plantar flexor (PF) muscles during repeated maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVICs) between children and adults. Prepubertal boys (n = 21; 9-11 yr) and men (n = 24; 18-30 yr) performed two fatigue protocols consisting of a repetition of 5-s isometric MVIC of the KE or PF muscles interspersed with 5-s passive recovery periods until MVIC reached 60% of its initial value. The etiology of neuromuscular fatigue of the KE and PF muscles was investigated by means of noninvasive methods, such as the surface electromyography, single and doublet magnetic stimulation, twitch interpolation technique, and near-infrared spectroscopy. The number of repetitions performed was significantly lower in men (15.4 ± 3.8) than boys (38.7 ± 18.8) for the KE fatigue test. In contrast, no significant difference was found for the PF muscles between boys and men (12.1 ± 4.9 and 13.8 ± 4.9 repetitions, respectively). Boys displayed a lower reduction in potentiated twitch torque, low-frequency fatigue, and muscle oxygenation than men whatever the muscle group considered. In contrast, voluntary activation level and normalized electromyography data decreased to a greater extent in boys than men for both muscle groups. To conclude, boys experienced less peripheral and more central fatigue during repeated MVICs than men whatever the muscle group considered. However, child-adult differences in neuromuscular fatigue were muscle-dependent since boys fatigued similarly to men with the PF muscles and to a lower extent with the KE muscles. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Child-adult differences in neuromuscular fatigue during repeated maximal voluntary contractions are specific to the muscle group since children fatigue similarly to adults with the plantar flexor muscles and to a lower extent with the knee extensor muscles. Children experience less peripheral fatigue and more central fatigue than adults, regardless of the muscle group considered.},

We compared cerebral oxygen availability during exercise in cognitively impaired (CI) to cognitively normal (CN) COPD patients. Fifty-two patients (FEV1: 51 ± 16%) were classified as CN or CI according to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Patients performed cycle-ergometry at 75% peak capacity with continuous measurement of Near-Infrared Spectroscopy frontal-cortex Tissue oxygen Saturation Index (TSI), cerebral haemoglobin indices (oxy/deoxy/total- Hb), transcutaneous carbon-dioxide partial pressure (TcPCO2), and arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2). Twenty-one patients (40%) presented evidences of CI. During exercise, CN and CI patients exhibited mild to moderate SpO2decline (nadir[$\Delta$]≥ −3 ± 2% and −5 ± 3%, respectively) but preserved baseline frontal-cortex TSI levels, whilst presenting small TcPCO2 perturbations and increased cerebral total-Hb (post [$\Delta$]≥ 2.0 ± 3 $\mu$M sec−1). CI patients preserve the capacity to adequately maintain cerebral oxygen availability during submaximal exercise. Therefore, rehabilitative exercise training in CI patients with COPD exhibiting mild to moderate exercise-induced SpO2 decline does not appear to lead to reduced cerebral oxygen availability.},

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of acute hypoxia exposure on physiological and perceptual responses, and muscle oxygenation during maximal incremental running exercise. Seven male elite rugby sevens players volunteered to participate in this study. In a randomized crossover design, the subjects completed two incremental running exercise tests either under normoxia (FiO2 = 20.9%) or after a 3-hr exposure to hypoxia (FiO2 = 14.5%). During both exercise conditions, pulmonary gas exchange was measured using a portable Metamax3B, rating of perceived exertion (RPE) using Borg's (6-20) scale, and muscle oxygenation at the quadriceps using a portable near-infrared spectroscopy. The results indicated that VO2peak, VEpeak, HRpeak, vVO2peak, and time to exhaustion were significantly lower (P<0.05), while the tissue oxyhemoglobin and total hemoglobin were significantly higher (P<0.05) in acute hypoxia than in normoxia. There was no significant difference in RPE scale during maximal exercise between the conditions (P>0.05). In addition, there was a strong positive correlation between RPE and time to exhaustion (r = 0.930) only in normoxia but not in hypoxia, with no correlations observed in other variables in both conditions (P<0.05). The present finding suggests that despite hypoxia-induced higher physiological and metabolic stress during maximal exercise, perceptual response did not differ between the conditions. These findings suggest that RPE scales may be used as a viable method for monitoring and prescribing exercise intensity during exercise, independent of hypoxia.},

abstract = {A functional evaluation of skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism during dynamic knee extension (KE) incremental exercises was carried out following a 35-day bed rest (BR) (Valdoltra 2008 BR campaign). Nine young male volunteers (age: 23.5 ± 2.2 yr; mean ± SD) were evaluated. Pulmonary gas exchange, heart rate and cardiac output (by impedance cardiography), skeletal muscle (vastus lateralis) fractional O 2 extraction, and brain (frontal cortex) oxygenation (by near-infrared spectroscopy) were determined during incremental KE. Values at exhaustion were considered "peak". Peak heart rate (147 ± 18 beats/min before vs. 146 ± 17 beats/min after BR) and peak cardiac output (17.8 ± 3.3 l/min before vs. 16.1 ± 1.8 l/min after BR) were unaffected by BR. As expected, brain oxygenation did not decrease during KE. Peak O 2 uptake was lower after vs. before BR, both when expressed as liters per minute (0.99 ± 0.17 vs. 1.26 ± 0.27) and when normalized per unit of quadriceps muscle mass (46.5 ± 6.4 vs. 56.9 ± 11.0 ml{\textperiodcentered}min±1{\textperiodcentered}100 g -1). Skeletal muscle peak fractional O 2 extraction, expressed as a percentage of the maximal values obtained during a transient limb ischemia, was lower after (46.3 ± 12.1%) vs. before BR (66.5 ± 11.2%). After elimination, by the adopted exercise protocol, of constraints related to cardiovascular O 2 delivery, a decrease in peak O 2 uptake and muscle peak capacity of fractional O 2 extraction was found after 35 days of BR. These findings suggest a substantial impairment of oxidative function at the muscle level, "downstream" with respect to bulk blood flow to the exercising muscles, that is possibly at the level of blood flow distribution/O 2 utilization inside the muscle, peripheral O 2 diffusion, and intracellular oxidative metabolism.

abstract = {New Findings: What is the central question of this study? The pulmonary oxygen uptake ((Formula presented.)) data used to study the muscle aerobic system dynamics during moderate-exercise transitions is classically described as a mono-exponential function controlled by a complex interaction of the oxygen delivery–utilization balance. This elevated complexity complicates the acquisition of relevant information regarding aerobic system dynamics based on (Formula presented.) data during a varying exercise stimulus. What is the main finding and its importance? The elevated complexity of (Formula presented.) dynamics is a consequence of a multiple-order interaction between muscle oxygen uptake and circulatory distortion. Our findings challenge the use of a first-order function to study the influences of the oxygen delivery–utilization balance over the (Formula presented.) dynamics. The assumption of aerobic system linearity implies that the pulmonary oxygen uptake ((Formula presented.)) dynamics during exercise transitions present a first-order characteristic. The main objective of this study was to test the linearity of the oxygen delivery–utilization balance during random moderate exercise. The cardiac output ((Formula presented.)) and deoxygenated haemoglobin concentration ([HHb]) were measured to infer the central and local O2 availability, respectively. Thirteen healthy men performed two consecutive pseudorandom binary sequence cycling exercises followed by an incremental protocol. The system input and the outputs (Formula presented.), [HHb] and (Formula presented.) were submitted to frequency-domain analysis. The linearity of the variables was tested by computing the ability of the response at a specific frequency to predict the response at another frequency. The predictability levels were assessed by the coefficient of determination. In a first-order system, a participant who presents faster dynamics at a specific frequency should also present faster dynamics at any other frequency. All experimentally obtained variables ((Formula presented.), [HHb] and (Formula presented.)) presented a certainly degree of non-linearity. The local O2 availability, evaluated by the ratio (Formula presented.) /[HHb], presented the most irregular behaviour. The overall [HHb] kinetics were faster than (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.) kinetics. In conclusion, the oxygen delivery–utilization balance behaved as a non-linear phenomenon. Therefore, the elevated complexity of the pulmonary oxygen uptake dynamics is governed by a complex multiple-order interaction between the oxygen delivery and utilization systems.},

J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2018-The Elevation Training Mask 2.0 (ETM) is a commercial training mask that purportedly simulates altitude training, although their effects have not been conclusively demonstrated. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of wearing the ETM on muscle and brain oxygenation responses during a maximal incremental cycling test, as well as the influence of this device on the heart rate (HR) response, perception of effort (rating of perceived exertion [RPE]), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), blood lactate (La), and performance (POpeak). Fourteen active males completed an incremental cycling test to volitional exhaustion in 2 separate and counterbalanced conditions, wearing the mask set at 9,000 feet (i.e., 2743 m) and a control condition (CTR, without ETM). During the trial, muscle and cerebral oxygenation were monitored continuously using near-infrared spectroscopy. Heart rate, RPE, and SaO2 were also recorded from the beginning of the test until the volitional exhaustion. La was measured at the end of each test. Wearing the ETM significantly reduced the POpeak by -6.9 +/- 6.6% (p = 0.002) and this was accompanied by lower La values (-12.8 +/- 21.6%; p = 0.027). SaO2 was also significantly lower at maximal intensity in comparison with the CTR condition (-1.5 +/- 0.3%; p = 0.028). However, both HR and RPE showed a similar trend during both sessions, as well as muscle oxygenation. Nevertheless, the mask caused an increase in brain oxygenation compared with the CTR condition (p < 0.05). In conclusion, our findings suggest that wearing the ETM causes a pronounced increase in O2Hb and tHb in the frontoparietal cortex without any change in the muscle oxygenation.},

abstract = {Introduction: Mobility declines with age and further with neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Walking and turning ability, in particular, are vital aspects of mobility that deteriorate with age and are further impaired in PD. Such deficits have been linked with reduction in automatic control of movement and the need for compensatory cognitive cortical control via the pre-frontal cortex (PFC), however the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. Establishing and using a robust methodology to examine PFC activity during continuous walking and turning via mobile functional near infra-red spectroscopy (fNIRS) may aid in the understanding of mobility deficits and help with development of appropriate therapeutics. This study aimed to: (1) examine test re-test reliability of PFC activity during continuous turning and walking via fNIRS measurement; and (2) compare PFC activity during continuous turning and walking in young, old and Parkinson's subjects. Methods: Twenty-five young (32.3 ± 7.5 years), nineteen older (65.4 ± 7.0 years), and twenty-four PD (69.3 ± 4.1 years) participants performed continuous walking and 360° turning-in-place tasks, each lasting 2 min. Young participants repeated the tasks a second time to allow fNIRS measurement reliability assessment. The primary outcome was PFC activity, assessed via measuring changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) concentrations. Results: PFC activity during continuous walking and turning was moderately reproducible (Intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.67). The PD group had higher PFC activation than young and older adults during walking and turning, with significant group differences for bilateral PFC activation (p = 0.025), left PFC activation (p = 0.012), and the early period (first 40 s) of walking (p = 0.007), with greater activation required in PD. Interestingly, older adults had similar PFC activation to young adults across conditions, however older adults required greater activation than young adults during continuous turning, specifically the early period of the turning task (Cohens d = 0.86). Conclusions: PFC activity can be measured during continuous walking and turning tasks with acceptable reliability, and can differentiate young, older and PD groups. PFC activation was significantly greater in PD compared to young and older adults during walking, particularly when beginning to walk.},

abstract = {Nightmares are intensely negative dreams that awaken the dreamer. Frequent nightmares are thought to reflect an executive deficit in regulating arousal. Within a diathesis-stress framework, this arousal is specific to negative contexts, though a differential susceptibility framework predicts elevated arousal in response to both negative and positive contexts. The current study tested these predictions by assessing subjective arousal and changes in frontal oxyhemoglobin (oxyHB) concentrations during negative and positive picture-viewing in nightmare sufferers (NM) and control subjects (CTL). 27 NM and 27 CTL subjects aged 18–35 rated subjective arousal on a 1–9 scale following sequences of negative, neutral and positive images; changes in oxyHB were measured by Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) using a 2 × 4 template on the frontal pole. Participants also completed the Highly Sensitive Person Scale, a trait marker for differential susceptibility; and completed a dream diary reporting negative and positive dream emotionality. The NM group had higher trait sensitivity, yet higher ratings of negative but not positive emotion in diary dreams. NM compared to CTL subjects reported higher subjective arousal in response to picture-viewing regardless of valence. Dysphoric dream distress, measured prospectively, was negatively associated with frontal activation when viewing negative pictures. Results suggest NM sufferers are highly sensitive to images regardless of valence according to subjective measures, and that there is a neural basis to level of trait and prospective nightmare distress. Future longitudinal or intervention studies should further explore positive emotion sensitivity and imagery in NM sufferers.},

abstract = {Noninvasive brain stimulation has shown considerable promise for enhancing cognitive functions by the long-term manipulation of neuroplasticity [1-3]. However, the observation of such improvements has been focused at the behavioral level, and enhancements largely restricted to the performance of basic tasks. Here, we investigate whether transcranial random noise stimulation (TRNS) can improve learning and subsequent performance on complex arithmetic tasks. TRNS of the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a key area in arithmetic [4, 5], was uniquely coupled with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to measure online hemodynamic responses within the prefrontal cortex. Five consecutive days of TRNS-accompanied cognitive training enhanced the speed of both calculation- and memory-recall-based arithmetic learning. These behavioral improvements were associated with defined hemodynamic responses consistent with more efficient neurovascular coupling within the left DLPFC. Testing 6 months after training revealed long-lasting behavioral and physiological modifications in the stimulated group relative to sham controls for trained and nontrained calculation material. These results demonstrate that, depending on the learning regime, TRNS can induce long-term enhancement of cognitive and brain functions. Such findings have significant implications for basic and translational neuroscience, highlighting TRNS as a viable approach to enhancing learning and high-level cognition by the long-term modulation of neuroplasticity. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Objectives: This pilot study assessed whether frontal lobe transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with complex walking rehabilitation is feasible, safe, and shows preliminary efficacy for improving walking and executive function. Materials and Methods: Participants were randomized to one of the following 18-session interventions: active tDCS and rehabilitation with complex walking tasks (Active/Complex); sham tDCS and rehabilitation with complex walking tasks (Sham/Complex); or sham tDCS and rehabilitation with typical walking (Sham/Typical). Active tDCS was delivered over F3 (cathode) and F4 (anode) scalp locations for 20 min at 2 mA intensity. Outcome measures included tests of walking function, executive function, and prefrontal activity measured by functional near infrared spectroscopy. Results: Ninety percent of participants completed the intervention protocol successfully. tDCS side effects of tingling or burning sensations were low (average rating less than two out of 10). All groups demonstrated gains in walking performance based on within-group effect sizes (d ≥ 0.50) for one or more assessments. The Sham/Typical group showed the greatest gains for walking based on between-group effect sizes. For executive function, the Active/Complex group showed the greatest gains based on moderate to large between-group effect sizes (d = 0.52–1.11). Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) findings suggest improved prefrontal cortical activity during walking. Conclusions: Eighteen sessions of walking rehabilitation combined with tDCS is a feasible and safe intervention for older adults. Preliminary effects size data indicate a potential improvement in executive function by adding frontal tDCS to walking rehabilitation. This study justifies future larger clinical trials to better understand the benefits of combining tDCS with walking rehabilitation.},

abstract = {The aim was to evaluate changes in peripheral and cerebral oxygenation, cardiorespiratory, and performance differences, as well as neuromuscular fatigue across multiple levels of blood flow restriction (BFR) during a repeated cycling sprint test to exhaustion (RST). Participants performed three RST (10-sec maximal sprints with 20-sec recovery until exhaustion) with measurements of power output and V̇O2peak as well as oxygenation (near-infrared spectroscopy) of the vastus lateralis and prefrontal cortex. Neuromuscular fatigue was assessed by femoral nerve stimulation to evoke the vastus lateralis. Tests were conducted with proximal lower limb bilateral vascular occlusion at 0%, 45%, and 60% of resting pulse elimination pressure. Total work decreased with BFR (52.5 ± 22.9% at 45%, 68.6 ± 32.6% at 60%, P < 0.01 compared with 0%) as V̇O2peak (12.6 ± 9.3% at 45%, 18.2 ± 7.2% at 60%, compared with 0%, P < 0.01). Decreased changes in muscle deoxyhemoglobin (∆[HHb]) during sprints were demonstrated at 60% compared to 0% (P < 0.001). Changes in total hemoglobin concentrations (∆[tHb]) increased at both 45% and 60% compared with 0% (P < 0.001). Cerebral ∆[tHb] increased toward exhaustion (P < 0.05). Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), voluntary activation level (VAL), and root mean square (RMS)/M-wave ratio decreased at 60% compared with 0% (P < 0.001, all). MVC and VAL decreased between 45% and 60% (P < 0.05, both). The application of BFR during RST induced greater changes in tissue perfusion (via blood volume, ∆[tHb]) suggesting a possible stimulus for vascular blood flow regulation. Additionally, high-intensity sprint exercise with partial ischemia may challenge cerebral blood flow regulation and influence local fatigue development due to protection of cerebral function.},

abstract = {Elevated cardiorespiratory fitness improves resting cerebral perfusion, although to what extent this is further amplified during acute exposure to exercise stress and the corresponding implications for cerebral oxygenation remain unknown. To examine this, we recruited 12 moderately active and 12 sedentary healthy males. Middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv) and prefrontal cortical oxyhemoglobin (cO 2 Hb) concentration were monitored continuously at rest and throughout an incremental cycling test to exhaustion. Despite a subtle elevation in the maximal oxygen uptake (active: 52±9 ml/kg per minute versus sedentary: 33±5 ml/kg per minute, P<0.05), resting MCAv was not different between groups. However, more marked increases in both MCAv (+28±13% versus +18±6%, P<0.05) and cO 2 Hb (+5±4% versus -2±3%, P<0.05) were observed in the active group during the transition from low- to moderate-intensity exercise. Collectively, these findings indicate that the long-term benefits associated with moderate increase in physical activity are not observed in the resting state and only become apparent when the cerebrovasculature is challenged by acute exertional stress. This has important clinical implications when assessing the true extent of cerebrovascular adaptation.},

abstract = {Purpose Small sided games (SSG) of football are an effective and efficient format to simultaneously train the physiological, technical, and tactical components of football. The duration of the recovery period between bouts of SSG will affect the physiological response to subsequent bouts. It was hypothesised that decreasing the duration of recovery periods separating serial SSG bouts would increase physiological, and perceptual responses, and decrease high speed running, and distance during SSG bouts. Methods Twelve experienced footballers (mean ± SD; age 21 ± 3 yrs; VO2peak 64 ±7ml{\textperiodcentered}min{\textperiodcentered}kg-1; playing experience 15 ± 3 yrs) completed two SSG sessions. Each SSG consisted of 3 vs. 3 players and 6 bouts of 2 min duration, with bouts separated by either 30 s recovery (REC- 30) or 120 s recovery (REC-120). Deoxygenated haemoglobin (HHb) in the vastus lateralis (VL) (using near infrared spectroscopy), heart rate (HR) and time motion descriptors (TMD) (speed and distance) were measured continuously during the SSG sessions and perceived exertion (RPE) was measured for each bout. Results During the recovery periods, in REC-30 compared to REC-120, there was a significant (p < 0.05) main effect of a higher HHb and HR. During the bouts, in REC-30 compared to REC- 120, there were no significant differences in HHb, HR, RPE, or TMD, but within both REC- 30 and REC-120 there were significant increases as a function of bout number in RPE. Conclusions Although a four-fold increase in recovery period allowed a significant increase in the recovery of HHb and HR, this did not increase the physiological, and perceptual responses, or time motion descriptors during the bouts. These results could have been due to the regulation of effort (pacing), in these experienced players performing an exercise task to which they were well adapted.},

Nonetheless, the deoxygenation pattern of jaw muscles of healthy subjects with frequent wake-time tooth-clenching episodes, who are at greater risk for TMD, has never been investigated. This case-control study compared the deoxygenation of the masseter during standardized tasks between TMD-free individuals with frequent self-reports of wake-time clenching and those with infrequent self-reports. University students (N = 255) filled out the Oral Behavior Checklist. Fourteen females with high versus low scores—high parafunctional (HP) group (n = 7, ≥80th percentile of score distribution) versus low parafunctional (LP) group (n = 7, ≤20th percentile)—completed 2 sessions during which they clenched at their maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) for 2 min and at 10% to 20% MVC for 20 min. Tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) and changes in oxygenated hemoglobin, deoxygenated hemoglobin, and total hemoglobin of the masseter were measured via near-infrared spectroscopy and analyzed with a generalized mixed effect model. A significant interaction effect (task × study group) was found on all outcome measures, indicating that the deoxygenation pattern of the HP group differed from the LP group (all P < 0.001). MVC of the masseter induced an almost 5-times-greater reduction of StO2 in the HP group as compared with the LP group (P = 0.023). However, the relative increase in StO2 at rest after the MVC was similar between groups (P > 0.05). At the end of the prolonged MVC task (10% to 20%), the blood flow (change in total hemoglobin) was almost 6 times higher in the LP group as compared with baseline. On the contrary, it increased minimally in the HP group (all P < 0.001). Healthy individuals at risk for TMD have abnormalities in masseter deoxygenation. Future prospective studies are needed to test whether this contributes to the onset of muscular TMD.},

abstract = {The purpose was to test the hypothesis that sex and fatigue effect of the early phase of skeletal muscle tissue oxygenation (StO2, %) desaturation rate as well as that strength matched adults may exhibit similar responses. Twenty-four adults visited the laboratory twice to quantify this early phase of desaturation during vascular occlusion tests (VOT) while in a rested state. The second visit included a sustained handgrip task at 25% of maximal muscular strength until task failure. At failure, a post-task VOT was initiated. Muscle desaturation was defined as StO2 and collected by a near-infrared spectroscopy device. The muscle size and adipose thickness were determined via ultrasonography. Linear regression was used to quantify the rates of desaturation during the VOTs as well as during the fatiguing handgrip. There were sex differences in the rate of desaturation pre- and post-handgrip, such that independent of fatigue, the men (p < 0.001) desaturated more rapidly than the women (pre: b = − 0.208 vs. − 0.123%∙s−1; post: − 0.079 vs. − 0.070%∙s−1). During the fatiguing handgrip, the transformed StO2 values indicated that the males desaturated more rapidly than the females (b = − 0.070 vs. − 0.015). The matched pairs exhibited the same responses as the total sample. Overall, muscle size and strength as well as adipose tissue were likely not the primary cause of the differences in rates of muscle desaturation. We hypothesized that differences in fiber type and mitochondria were the principle mechanisms provoking the differences in muscle oxygenation.},

abstract = {Key points: Blood flow restricted resistance exercise (BFR-RE) is capable of inducing comparable adaptations to traditional resistance exercise (RE), despite a lower total exercise volume. It has been suggested that an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production may be involved in this response; however, oxygen partial pressure (PO2) is reduced during BFR-RE, and the influence of PO2 on mitochondrial redox balance remains poorly understood. In human skeletal muscle tissue, we demonstrate that both maximal and submaximal mitochondrial ROS emission rates are acutely decreased 2 h following BFR-RE, but not RE, occurring along with a reduction in tissue oxygenation during BFR-RE. We further suggest that PO2 is involved in this response because an in vitro analysis revealed that reducing PO2 dramatically decreased mitochondrial ROS emissions and electron leak to ROS. Altogether, these data indicate that mitochondrial ROS emission rates are attenuated following BFR-RE, and such a response is likely influenced by reductions in PO2. Abstract: Low-load blood flow restricted resistance exercise (BFR-RE) training has been proposed to induce comparable adaptations to traditional resistance exercise (RE) training, however, the acute signalling events remain unknown. Although a suggested mechanism of BFR-RE is an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, oxygen partial pressure (PO2) is reduced during BFR-RE, and the influence of O2 tension on mitochondrial redox balance remains ambiguous. We therefore aimed to determine whether skeletal muscle mitochondrial bioenergetics were altered following an acute bout of BFR-RE or RE, and to further examine the role of PO2 in this response. Accordingly, muscle biopsies were obtained from 10 males at rest and 2 h after performing three sets of single-leg squats (RE or BFR-RE) to failure at 30% one-repetition maximum. We determined that mitochondrial respiratory capacity and ADP sensitivity were not altered in response to RE or BFR-RE. Although maximal (succinate) and submaximal (non-saturating ADP) mitochondrial ROS emission rates were unchanged following RE, BFR-RE attenuated these responses by ∼30% compared to pre-exercise, occurring along with a reduction in skeletal muscle tissue oxygenation during BFR-RE (P < 0.01 vs. RE). In a separate cohort of participants, evaluation of mitochondrial bioenergetics in vitro revealed that mild O2 restriction (50 µm) dramatically attenuated maximal (∼4-fold) and submaximal (∼50-fold) mitochondrial ROS emission rates and the fraction of electron leak to ROS compared to room air (200 µm). Combined, these data demonstrate that mitochondrial ROS emissions are attenuated following BFR-RE, a response which may be mediated by a reduction in skeletal muscle PO2.},

The aim was to compare physiological responses to this self-paced V˙ O 2 max protocol (SPV) in comparison to a traditional ramp V˙ O 2 max (RAMP) protocol in young (18–30 years) and old (50–75 years) participants. Methods: Forty-four participants (22 young; 22 old) completed both protocols in a randomised, counter-balanced, crossover design. The SPV included 5 × 2 min stages, participants were able to self-regulate their power output (PO) by using incremental ‘clamps' in ratings of perceived exertion. The RAMP consisted of either 15 or 20 W min−1. Results: Expired gases, cardiac output (Q), stroke volume (SV), muscular deoxyhaemoglobin (deoxyHb) and electromyography (EMG) at the vastus lateralis were recorded throughout. Results demonstrated significantly higher V˙ O 2 max in the SPV (49.68 ± 10.26 ml kg−1 min−1) vs. the RAMP (47.70 ± 9.98 ml kg−1 min−1) in the young, but not in the old group (>0.05). Q and SV were significantly higher in the SPV vs. the RAMP in the young (<0.05) but not in the old group (>0.05). No differences seen in deoxyHb and EMG for either age groups (>0.05). Peak PO was significantly higher in the SPV vs. the RAMP in both age groups (<0.05). Conclusion: Findings demonstrate that the SPV produces higher V˙ O 2 max, peak Q and SV values in the young group. However, older participants achieved similar V˙ O 2 max values in both protocols, mostly likely due to age-related differences in cardiovascular responses to incremental exercise, despite them achieving a higher physiological workload in the SPV.},

abstract = {It is well established that older adults are less able to perform attentionally demanding motor tasks, placing them at greater risk of accident-related injury. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate whether the interplay between prefrontal and motor cortex activity could predict such age-related performance deficits. Using a dual-task (DT) paradigm, 15 younger and 15 older adults participated in experiment 1, where brain activity was simultaneously measured using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Experiment 1 demonstrated poorer performance for the older group across a range of DTs combining visuomotor arm tracking with a secondary cognitive or motor task. Interestingly however, older adults' DT performance error was isolated to the motor component of DTs. TMS data revealed reduced motor cortex (M1) inhibition during DTs for older adults, and a trend for this correlating with poorer performance. In contrast, poorer performing younger adults showed significantly higher M1 inhibition. Experiment 2 was conducted given a high amount of movement artifact in experiment 1 fNIRS data. Using fNIRS to measure prefrontal, premotor, and motor cortex activity in an additional 15 older adults, we found no evidence of an interplay between these regions predicting DT performance. Nevertheless, performance data replicated experiment 1 in showing that DT error was isolated to motor tasks in older adults, with no significant cognitive task error. Overall, this study shows that older adults seemed to adopt a ‘cognitive-first' prioritisation strategy during the DTs involved in our study, and that deficits in DT performance may be related to the modulation of M1 inhibitory mechanisms. We propose that clinicians advise older adults to allocate greater attention to motor tasks during activities where they may be at risk of accident-related injury.},

Objective We investigated the impact of an active break intervention on typically developing children's cognitive functions and brain activity, sitting/standing/stepping, on-task behaviour, and enjoyment. Methods Up to 141 children, aged between 6 and 8 years (46% girls), were included, although about half of them completed two of the assessments (n = 77, working memory; n = 67, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex haemodynamic response). Classrooms from two consenting schools were randomly allocated to a six-week simple or cognitively engaging active break intervention. Classrooms from another school acted as a control group. The main analyses used linear mixed models, clustered at the class level and adjusted for sex and age, to investigate the effects of the interventions on response inhibition, lapses of attention, working memory, event-related brain haemodynamic response (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). The mediating effects of sitting/standing/stepping on cognition/brain activity were also explored. To test intervention fidelity, we investigated differences by group on the change values in children's sitting, standing, and moving patterns during class/school time using linear mixed models. Generalized linear mixed models clustered at the individual level were used to examine ontask behaviour data. For the intervention groups only, we also assessed children's perceived enjoyment, physical exertion and mental exertion related to the active breaks and compared the results using independent t-tests. Results There was a significantly greater positive change in the proportion of deoxygenated haemoglobin in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of children assigned to cognitively engaging active breaks compared to the control group (B = 1.53 × 10-07, 95% CI [0.17 × 10-07, 2.90 × 10-07]), which under the same cognitive performance is suggestive of improved neural efficiency. Mixed models showed no significant effects on response inhibition, lapses of attention, working memory. The mediation analysis revealed that the active breaks positively affected response inhibition via a change in sitting and standing time. The sitting, standing, and moving patterns and on-task behaviour were positively affected by the active breaks at end of trial, but not at mid-trial. Children in both intervention groups showed similarly high levels of enjoyment of active breaks. Conclusion Cognitively engaging active breaks may improve brain efficiency in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the neural substrate of executive functions, as well as response inhibition, via effects partially mediated by the change in sitting/stepping time. Active breaks can effectively reduce sitting and increase standing/stepping and improve on-task behaviour, but the regular implementation of these activities might require time for teachers to become familiar with. Further research is needed to confirm what type of active break best facilitates cognition.},

abstract = {Purpose: The recovery of muscle oxygen consumption (mV˙ O2) after exercise provides a measure of skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity, as more and better-functioning mitochondria will be able to restore mV˙ O2 faster to the pre-exercise state. The aim was to measure muscle mitochondrial capacity using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) within a healthy, normally active population and relate this to parameters of aerobic fitness, investigating the applicability and relevance of using NIRS to assess muscle mitochondrial capacity non-invasively. Methods: Mitochondrial capacity was analysed in the gastrocnemius and flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) muscles of eight relatively high-aerobic fitness (V˙ O2peak ≥ 57 mL/kg/min) and eight relatively low-aerobic fitness male subjects (V˙ O2peak ≤ 47 mL/kg/min). Recovery of whole body V˙ O2, i.e. excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) was analysed after a cycling protocol. Results: Mitochondrial capacity, as analysed using NIRS, was significantly higher in high-fitness individuals compared to low-fitness individuals in the gastrocnemius, but not in the FDS (p = 0.0036 and p = 0.20, respectively). Mitochondrial capacity in the gastrocnemius was significantly correlated with V˙ O2peak (R2 = 0.57, p = 0.0019). Whole body V˙ O2 recovery was significantly faster in the high-fitness individuals (p = 0.0048), and correlated significantly with mitochondrial capacity in the gastrocnemius (R2 = 0.34, p = 0.028). Conclusion: NIRS measurements can be used to assess differences in mitochondrial muscle oxygen consumption within a relatively normal, healthy population. Furthermore, mitochondrial capacity correlated with parameters of aerobic fitness (V˙ O2peak and EPOC), emphasising the physiological relevance of the NIRS measurements.},

@article{kooistra_knee_2006,
abstract = {Recently, fatigability and muscle oxygen consumption (mVO2) during sustained isometric contractions were found to be less at shorter (30° knee angle; 0° = full extension) compared to longer knee extensor muscle lengths (90°) and, at low torques, less in the rectus femoris (RF) muscle than in the astus lateralis and medialis. In the present study we hypothesized that these findings could be accounted for by a knee angle- and a muscle-dependent activation respectively. On two experimental days rectified surface EMG (rsEMG) was obtained as a measure of muscle activation in nine healthy young males. In addition, on day 1 maximal torque capacity (MTC) was carefully determined using superimposed nerve stimulation on brief high intensity contractions (> 70%MVC) at 30, 60 and 90° knee angles. On day 2, subjects performed longer lasting isometric contractions (10-70%MTC) while mVO2 was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). At 30°, maximal m VO2 was reached significantly later (11.0 s ± 6.5 s) and was 57.9 ± 8.3% less (average ± SD, across intensities and muscles) than m VO2 at 60 and 90° (p < 0.05). However, rsEMG was on average only 18.0 ± 11.8% (p = 0.062) less at the start of the contraction at 30°. At 10%MTC at all knee angles, maximal m VO2 of the RF occurred significantly later (28.8 ± 36.0 s) and showed a significantly smaller increase in rsEMG compared to both vasti. In conclusion, it is unlikely that the tendency for less intense muscle activation could fully account for the ∼60% lower oxygen consumption at 30°, but the later increase in RFm VO2 seemed to be caused by a less strong activation of the RF. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2006.},

abstract = {Dietary nitrate (NO3 -) supplementation via beetroot juice (BR) has been reported to lower oxygen cost (i.e., increased exercise efficiency) and speed up oxygen uptake (VO2) kinetics in untrained and moderately trained individuals, particularly during conditions of low oxygen availability (i.e., hypoxia). However, the effects of multiple-day, high dose (12.4 mmol NO- 3 per day) BR supplementation on exercise efficiency and VO2 kinetics during normoxia and hypoxia in well-trained individuals are not resolved. In a double-blinded, randomized crossover study, 12 3 well-trained cyclists (66.4 ± 5.3 ml min-1∙kg-1) completed three transitions from 6 rest to moderate-intensity ($\sim$70% of gas exchange threshold) cycling in hypoxia 38 and normoxia with supplementation of BR or nitrate-depleted BR as placebo. 3 Continuous measures of VO2 and muscle (vastus lateralis) deoxygenation ($\Delta$HHb, 9 using near-infrared spectroscopy) were acquired during all transitions. Kinetics of 4 VO2 and deoxygenation ($\Delta$HHb) were modelled using mono-exponential 1 functions. Our results showed that BR supplementation did not alter the primary time constant for VO2 or $\Delta$HHb during the transition from rest to moderate- intensity cycling. While BR supplementation lowered the amplitude of the VO2 response (2.1%, p=0.038), BR did not alter steady state VO2 derived from the fit (p=0.258), raw VO2 data (p=0.231), moderate intensity exercise efficiency 47 (p=0.333) nor steady state $\Delta$HHb (p=0.224). Altogether, these results demonstrate that multiple-day, high-dose BR supplementation does not alter exercise Journal Pre-proof efficiency or oxygen uptake kinetics during normoxia and hypoxia in well-trained athletes.},

abstract = {New Findings: What is the central question of this study? Does manipulation of the work of breathing during high-intensity exercise alter respiratory and locomotor muscle blood flow? What is the main finding and its importance? We found that when the work of breathing was reduced during exercise, respiratory muscle blood flow decreased, while locomotor muscle blood flow increased. Conversely, when the work of breathing was increased, respiratory muscle blood flow increased, while locomotor muscle blood flow decreased. Our findings support the theory of a competitive relationship between locomotor and respiratory muscles during intense exercise. Manipulation of the work of breathing (WOB) during near-maximal exercise influences leg blood flow, but the effects on respiratory muscle blood flow are equivocal. We sought to assess leg and respiratory muscle blood flow simultaneously during intense exercise while manipulating WOB. Our hypotheses were as follows: (i) increasing the WOB would increase respiratory muscle blood flow and decrease leg blood flow; and (ii) decreasing the WOB would decrease respiratory muscle blood flow and increase leg blood flow. Eight healthy subjects (n = 5 men, n = 3 women) performed a maximal cycle test (day 1) and a series of constant-load exercise trials at 90% of peak work rate (day 2). On day 2, WOB was assessed with oesophageal balloon catheters and was increased (via resistors), decreased (via proportional assist ventilation) or unchanged (control) during the trials. Blood flow was assessed using near-infrared spectroscopy optodes placed over quadriceps and the sternocleidomastoid muscles, coupled with a venous Indocyanine Green dye injection. Changes in WOB were significantly and positively related to changes in respiratory muscle blood flow (r = 0.73), whereby increasing the WOB increased blood flow. Conversely, changes in WOB were significantly and inversely related to changes in locomotor blood flow (r = 0.57), whereby decreasing the WOB increased locomotor blood flow. Oxygen uptake was not different during the control and resistor trials (3.8 ± 0.9 versus 3.7 ± 0.8 l min−1, P > 0.05), but was lower on the proportional assist ventilator trial (3.4 ± 0.7 l min−1, P < 0.05) compared with control. Our findings support the concept that respiratory muscle work significantly influences the distribution of blood flow to both respiratory and locomotor muscles.},

abstract = {New Findings: What is the central question of this study? Continuous-wave near-infrared spectroscopy, coupled with venous and arterial occlusions, offers an economical, non-invasive alternative to measuring skeletal muscle blood flow and oxygen consumption, but its reliability during exercise has not been established. What is the main finding and its importance? Continuous-wave near-infrared spectroscopy devices can reliably assess local skeletal muscle blood flow and oxygen consumption from the vastus lateralis in healthy, physically active adults. The patterns of response exhibited during exercise of varying intensity agree with other published results using similar methodologies, meriting potential applications in clinical diagnosis and therapeutic assessment. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), coupled with rapid venous and arterial occlusions, can be used for the non-invasive estimation of resting local skeletal muscle blood flow (mBF) and oxygen consumption (m V02), respectively. However, the day-to-day reliability of mBF and m V02 responses to stressors such as incremental dynamic exercise has not been established. The aim of this study was to determine the reliability of NIRS-derived mBF and V02 responses from incremental dynamic exercise. Measurements of mBF and V02 were collected in the vastus lateralis of 12 healthy, physically active adults [seven men and five women; 25 (SD 6) years old] during three non-consecutive visits within 10 days. After 10 min rest, participants performed 3 min of rhythmic isotonic knee extension (one extension every 4 s) at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), before four venous occlusions and then two arterial occlusions. The mBF and (m V02) increased proportionally with intensity [from 0.55 to 7.68 ml min−1 (100 ml)−1 and from 0.05 to 1.86 ml O2 min−1 (100 g)−1, respectively] up to 25% MVC, where they began to plateau at 30% MVC. Moreover, an mBF/ m V02 muscle oxygen consumption ratio of ∼5 was consistent for all exercise stages. The intraclass correlation coefficient for mBF indicated high to very high reliability for 10–30% MVC (0.82–0.9). There was very high reliability for V02 across all exercise stages (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.91–0.96). In conclusion, NIRS can reliably assess muscle blood flow and oxygen consumption responses to low- to moderate-intensity exercise, meriting potential applications in clinical diagnosis and therapeutic assessment.},

Methods Eleven cyclists (10 males, 1 female; age, 27 ± 6 yr; VO2max = 60.8 ± 3.7 mL{\textperiodcentered}kg-1{\textperiodcentered}min-1) completed four, 6-min constant-load cycling trials at 10% below their previously determined gas exchange threshold (i.e., 63% ± 5% peak power) while pedaling at 60, 90, and 120 rpm, and a freely chosen cadence (94.3 ± 6.9 rpm) in randomized order. Standard cardiorespiratory parameters were measured and an esophageal electrode balloon catheter was used to assess electromyography of the diaphragm (EMGdi) and the work of breathing (Wb). Leg blood flow index (BFI) was determined on four muscles using near-infrared spectroscopy with indocyanine green dye injections. Results Oxygen uptake (VO2) increased as a function of increasing cadence (all pairwise comparisons, P < 0.05). The EMGdi and Wb were significantly greater at 120 rpm compared with all other conditions (all P < 0.01). Vastus medialis and semitendinosus BFI were significantly greater at 120 rpm compared with 60 and 90 rpm (all P < 0.05). Gastrocnemius BFI was higher at 120 rpm compared with all other cadences (all P < 0.01). No difference in BFI was found in the vastus lateralis (P = 0.06). Blood flow index was significantly correlated with the increase in VO2 with increasing cadence in the medial gastrocnemius (P < 0.001) and approached significance in the vastus lateralis (P = 0.09), vastus medialis (P = 0.06), and semitendinosus (P = 0.09). There was no effect of cadence on Borg 0-10 breathing or leg discomfort ratings (P > 0.05). Conclusions High cadence cycling at submaximal exercise intensities is metabolically inefficient and increases EMGdi, Wb, and leg muscle blood flow relative to slower cadences.},

Methods: Twenty (men: n = 15; women: n = 5) participants from an outpatient CR program were enrolled in the study. Each participant completed a cognitive performance test battery and a submaximal graded treadmill evaluation on separate occasions prior to and again upon completion of 18 individualized CR sessions. A functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) device was used to measure left and right prefrontal cortex (LPFC and RPFC) oxygenation parameters (oxyhemoglobin [O2Hb], deoxyhemoglobin [HHb], total hemoglobin [tHb], and oxyhemoglobin difference [Hbdiff]) during the cognitive test battery. Results: Patients showed improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness (+1.4 metabolic equivalents [METs]) and various cognitive constructs. A significant increase in PFC oxygenation, primarily in the LPFC region, occurred at post-CR testing. Negative associations between changes in cognition (executive function [LPFC O2Hb: r = −0.45, P =.049; LPFC tHb: r = −0.49, P =.030] and fluid composite score [RPFC Hbdiff: r = −0.47, P =.038; LPFC Hbdiff: r = −0.45, P =.048]) and PFC changes were detected. The change in cardiorespiratory fitness was positively associated with the change in working memory score (r = 0.55, P =.016). Conclusion: Cardiovascular disease patients enrolled in CR showed significant improvements in multiple cognitive domains along with increased cortical activation.

Following an assessment of cue utilization in the domain of driving, participants completed a moderate workload simulated driving task, during which cerebral oxygenation, eye behavior, and driving performance metrics were recorded. During the simulated driving task, participants with higher cue utilization recorded smaller increases in cerebral oxygenation in the prefrontal cortex relative to baseline, and smaller mean fixation dispersions, compared to participants with lower cue utilization. There were no statistically significant differences in the number of speed exceedances nor missed traffic signals based on cue utilization.

abstract = {Background: In sports medicine, near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is used to measure physiologic parameters of muscle function, and quantify the effects of exercise. Firstline treatment for urinary incontinence (UI) involves pelvic floor muscle (PFM) rehabilitation therapy (PFMT), but currently oxygen kinetic measures to quantify training effect are lacking. Methods: Half-recovery time of hemoglobin difference, HbDiff(&frac12;RT), following sustained maximal voluntary contraction (SMVC), is a validated, NIRS-derived, oxygen kinetic parameter used in exercise science and healthcare monitoring, shown previously to be applicable to the PFM in healthy women using a transvaginal NIRS interface. We evaluated if a PFMT training effect could be detected using HbDiff(&frac12;RT) measurement in symptomatic women with UI. Results: HbDiff(&frac12;RT) data sets were obtained from 7 symptomatic women prior to and following an 8-week, homebased PFMT regimen; these were compared in each individual and with data from 11 asymptomatic controls. A post training treatment effect was evident where HbDiff(&frac12;RT) shortened, indicating improved PFM metabolic function. Discussion: PFM NIRS monitoring proved feasible in a heterogeneous group of women with UI, provided a quantifiable kinetic parameter, and proved more comfortable than conventional perineal pressure measurements (perineometry). Importantly, in one subject with UI due to an incomplete spinal cord lesion, and no detectable PFM contractile ability on initial assessment, NIRS enabled a post-PFMT improvement to be detected using PFM oxygen kinetics. Conclusions: Calculation of HbDiff(&frac12;RT) following PFM SMVC allows a validated muscle reoxygenation parameter to be applied in evaluation of PFM dysfunction, and to measure training effect from rehabilitation exercise, potentially improving management of UI.},

With a fast sampling (fs > 50 Hz) continuous wave NIRS device, arterial (SaO2) and venous (SvO2) saturation can be measured using the physiological fluctuations in the oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb) and total hemoglobin (tHb) concentrations due to heart action and respiration. Before using this technique in a neonatal setting, the method was verified on adult volunteers (n=7) by decreasing inspired oxygen down to an arterial saturation of 70% using a pulse oximeter as reference. NIRS optodes were placed on the left forehead; the pulse oximeter sensor was placed on the right forehead. The experiments were repeated with different optode spacings. SaO2 and SvO2 were determined using the ratio between the O2Hb and tHb value in the amplitude spectrum at the heart rate and respiration rate, respectively. A good agreement between calculated SaO2 and reference SaO2 from pulse oximetry was found (bias range-3.5% to 5.2%, SD of the residuals 1.3% to 3.5%).

abstract = {Working memory is regarded as a cognitive system with limited capacity, which is responsible for saving, manipulating, and remembering online information. The cognitive functions of the brain, such as language, understanding, planning, reasoning, and problem-solving, need working memory. Based on the previous studies, working memory is considered as a central function of frontal brain lobe. Among several protocols on assessing working memory function, the n-back task is regarded as one of the most common ones in the functional imaging studies of working memory. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an optical imaging method for evaluating brain function, which measures nervous activities and hemodynamic response in the cerebral cortex. The present study aimed to assess functional connectivity in frontal brain lobe during conducting dual n-back task at three levels of memory loading (n = 0, 1, 2) by using fNIRS signals. The statistical population included 29 healthy volunteers, among which 11 and 18 ones were left- and right-handed, respectively. They performed a dual n-back task, and the change in the concentrations of Hb and HbO2 was measured by using 24 fNIRS channels existing in the frontal lobe. The matrix of functional connectivity was extracted and evaluated by using partial correlation criterion for all participants and each of right- and left-handed groups at every level of memory loading separately. The statistical analyses of Hb and HbO2 signals (p < 0.05) in each group represented the presence of a bilateral connection between two hemispheres and local connection ones between different areas in each hemisphere with more connectivity in the right hemisphere of the frontal cerebral cortex during conducting the dual n-back task. Based on the comparison of the results related to left- and right-handed groups, a difference was observed between their functional connectivity in some areas, as well as the number of connectivity between various areas. Right-handed participants more utilized the lateralization of the right hemisphere to perform task compared to left-handed did, while left-handed ones represented the decrease in lateralizing or distributing bilaterally in hemispheres, by indicating the difference between some of the brain connectivity were different in these participants by considering the dominance of one of the hemispheres in each of these two groups. In general, the results of the present study demonstrated that fNIRS data is considered as appropriate for assessing the functional connectivity between the different areas of the frontal cerebral cortex during conducting the working memory-related tasks.},

On four occasions, participants completed a square-wave protocol involving two bouts of running at 90-95% of estimated lactate threshold (Mod1 and Mod2), separated by 2 min of repeated supramaximal sprinting. V̇O2 p was measured breath by breath, heart rate (HR) beat to beat, and vastus lateralis oxygenation {deoxy-hemoglobin/myoglobin concentration (deoxy-[Hb+Mb])} using near-infrared spectroscopy. Mean response time of Q̇m (Q̇m MRT) was estimated by rearranging the Fick equation, using V̇O2 p and deoxy-[Hb+Mb] as proxies of muscle O2 uptake (V̇O2) and arteriovenous difference, respectively. HR, blood lactate concentration, total hemoglobin, and Q̇m were elevated before Mod2 compared with Mod1 (all P < 0.05). $\tau$V̇O2 p was shorter in VFK compared with MFK during Mod 1 (13.1 ± 1.8 vs. 21.0 ± 2.5 s, P < 0.01), but not in Mod2 (12.9 ± 1.5 vs. 13.7 ± 3.8 s, P < 1.0). Q̇m MRT was shorter in VFK compared with MFK in Mod1 (8.8 ± 1.9 vs. 17.0 ± 3.4 s, P < 0.01), but not in Mod 2 (10.1 ± 1.8 vs. 10.5 ± 3.5 s, P = 1.0). During Mod2, HR kinetics were slowed, whereas mean deoxy-[Hb+Mb] response time was unchanged. The difference in $\tau$V̇O2 p between Mod1 and Mod2 was related to Q̇m MRT measured at Mod1 (r = 0.71, P < 0.01). Present results suggest that local O2 delivery (i.e., Q̇m) may be a factor contributing to the V̇O2 kinetic during the onset of moderate-intensity, field-based running exercise, at least in subjects exhibiting moderately fast V̇O 2 kinetics.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Physiotherapy is considered an important treatment option in patients with upper limb complex regional pain syndrome type-1 (CRPS-1). In case of chronic CRPS-1, exercise therapy of the affected limb forms an important part of the physiotherapeutic program. We investigated whether muscle loading in chronic CRPS-1 patients is associated with impairments in muscle circulation of the forearm of the affected limb. METHODS: Thirty patients with chronic CRPS-1 unilaterally affecting their upper limbs, and 30 age-matched and sex-matched control participants were included in this study. Local muscle blood flow and hemoglobin oxygenation were measured by near infrared spectroscopy within the muscles of the forearm at rest, after 1-minute isometric handgrip exercises, and after arterial occlusion. Main outcome parameters were: local muscle blood flow, O2 consumption (mVO2), and postischemic reoxygenation (ReOx). RESULTS: We found no differences in baseline muscle blood flow, mVO2, and ReOx between the affected CRPS-1, unaffected CRPS-1, and control arms. After exercise, mVO2 of the affected CRPS-1 arms was not different from the clinically unaffected CRPS-1 arms. Furthermore, in comparison with the control arms, unaffected CRPS-1 arms showed no difference in mVO2 or ReOx. CONCLUSIONS: Muscle loading does not seems to be related to impairments in muscle oxygen uptake in forearm muscles of upper limbs affected by chronic CRPS-1. Our results suggest that exercise therapy can be safely used in physiotherapeutic training programs for chronic CRPS-1 of the upper limb. {\textcopyright} 2009 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the effects of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) oxygenation and dual-task performance in healthy young males. Changes in the concentration of oxygenated ($\Delta$HbO2) and deoxygenated hemoglobin ($\Delta$HHb) in the right and left PFC were examined during a cognitive auditory 2-back task. Cognitive performance (2-back task's accuracy) and walking motor performances were measured in single-tasks (single motor and single cognitive) and dual-task (2-back task + walking). Thirty-six young males were ranked according to their V˙O2 peak. The second tertile was excluded to generate two groups of different CRF (high fit group: n = 12 and V˙O2 peak = 56.0 ± 6.7 ml kg−1 min−1; low-fit group: n = 12 and V˙O2 peak = 36.7 ± 4.1 ml kg−1 min−1). The CRF groups were further split into two subgroups according to 24-h MAP (higher-MAP, lower-MAP). Two-way ANOVA (CRF x n-back conditions) revealed a significant interaction between the CRF and cognitive task condition on 2-back accuracy (p = .007) and a main effect of CRF on ⊗HHb in the right and left PFC (p < .05). These results suggest that in healthy young males: 1) for CRF, only low-fit individuals demonstrate dual-task costs in accuracy (Dual < Single), and 2) that in comparison to the low-fit group, the high fit-group demonstrated greater changes in PFC oxygenation in $\Delta$HHb, but not $\Delta$HbO2.},

abstract = {Oxygen uptake kinetics ($\tau$V̇O2) are slowed when exercise is initiated from a raised metabolic rate. Whether this reflects the recruitment of muscle fibres differing in oxidative capacity, or slowed blood flow (Q̇) kinetics is unclear. This study determined $\tau$V̇O2 in canine muscle in situ, with experimental control over muscle activation and Q̇ during contractions initiated from rest and a raised metabolic rate. The gastrocnemius complex of nine anaesthetised, ventilated dogs was isolated and attached to a force transducer. Isometric tetanic contractions (50 Hz; 200 ms duration) via supramaximal sciatic nerve stimulation were used to manipulate metabolic rate: 3 min stimulation at 0.33 Hz (S1), followed by 3 min at 0.67 Hz (S2). Circulation was initially intact (SPON), and subsequently isolated for pump-perfusion (PUMP) above the greatest value in SPON. Muscle V̇O2 was determined contraction-by-contraction using an ultrasonic flowmeter and venous oximeter, and normalised to tension-time integral (TTI). $\tau$V̇O2/TTI and $\tau$Q̇ were less in S1SPON (mean ± s.d.: 13 ± 3 s and 12 ± 4 s, respectively) than in S2SPON (29 ± 19 s and 31 ± 13 s, respectively; P < 0.05). $\tau$V̇O2/TTI was unchanged by pump-perfusion (S1PUMP, 12 ± 4 s; S2PUMP, 24 ± 6 s; P < 0.001) despite increased O2 delivery; at S2 onset, venous O2 saturation was 21 ± 4% and 65 ± 5% in SPON and PUMP, respectively. V̇O2 kinetics remained slowed when contractions were initiated from a raised metabolic rate despite uniform muscle stimulation and increased O2 delivery. The intracellular mechanism may relate to a falling energy state, approaching saturating ADP concentration, and/or slowed mitochondrial activation; but further study is required. These data add to the evidence that muscle V̇O2 control is more complex than previously suggested. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Physiological Society.},

Hearing assessment objectivization can be provided by monitoring or operating control of electrophysiological, hemodynamic and/or metabolic parameters of the auditory cortex.

abstract = {Context • Hypotension that occurs after a single bout of aerobic exercise also attenuates the vascular response to discrete stressors, an effect that can last for hours. It is unknown whether the hypotensive benefits of traditional exercise extend to alternative forms of mindful exercise, such as yoga, to confer transient protection against neurovascular challenges that increase blood pressure (BP). Objectives • The study intended to examine the effects of acute exercise on neurovascular responses to exposure of the forehead of female yoga practitioners to vasoconstrictive cold (ie, to cold pressor stress). Design • The research team designed a study with 3 conditions (ie, with participants' participation in 3 activities on separate days in a repeated-measures design). Participants were randomly assigned to perform the activities in 1 of 3 orders across successive visits. Participants • Participants were 9 females, 20 to 33 y old, who had regularly practiced Hatha yoga from 6 mo to 12 y before the start of the study. All participants were normotensive at entry to the study and had normal body weights for their heights. Interventions • All participants performed 3 activities: (1) self-directed yoga practice, the intervention; (2) cycling exercise at a self-selected intensity, a positive control; and (3) quiet rest, a negative control. Outcome Measures • Postintervention, participants' foreheads were exposed to cold. Their systolic blood pressures (SBPs), diastolic blood pressures (DBPs), pulse rates, and forearm oxygenation were assessed using near-infrared spectroscopy. Results • Participants' SBPs and DBPs increased during cold pressor stress under all conditions, concurrent with decreased forearm oxygenation. During recovery from the cold, participants' BPs declined to near precold pressor baseline levels after yoga and cycling but remained elevated after quiet rest. Conclusions • The enhanced recovery of BP from cold applied to the forehead after yoga practice or cycling exercise suggests that both types of exercise promote a hypotensive response, which could indicate lowered cardiovascular risk.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the relative contribution of human muscle reoxygenation on force recovery following a maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). Ten athletes (22{\textperiodcentered}9 ± 4{\textperiodcentered}0 years) executed a plantar-flexion sequence including two repeated MVCs [i.e. a 30-s MVC (MVC30) followed by a 10-s MVC (MVC10)] separated by 10, 30, 60, 120 or 300 s of passive recovery. A 10-min passive recovery period was allowed between each MVC sequence. This procedure was randomly repeated with two different recovery conditions: without (CON) or with (OCC) arterial occlusion of the medial gastrocnemius. During OCC, the occlusion was maintained from the end of MVC30 to the end of MVC10. Muscle oxygenation (Near-infrared spectroscopy, NIRS, [Hbdiff]) was continuously measured during all MVC sequences and expressed as a percentage of the maximal changes in optical density observed during MVC30. Maximal Torque was analysed at the start of each contraction. Torque during each MVC10 was expressed as a percentage of the Torque during the previous MVC30. Torque recovery was complete within 300 s after MVC30 during CON (MVC10 = 101{\textperiodcentered}8 ± 5{\textperiodcentered}0%); 88{\textperiodcentered}6 ± 8{\textperiodcentered}9% of the Torque was recovered during OCC (P = 0{\textperiodcentered}005). There was also a moderate correlation between absolute level of muscle oxygenation and Torque (r = 0{\textperiodcentered}32 (90% CI, 0{\textperiodcentered}09;0{\textperiodcentered}52), P = 0{\textperiodcentered}02). Present findings confirm the role of human muscle oxygenation in muscular force recovery during repeated-maximal efforts. However, the correlation between absolute muscle oxygenation and force level during recovery is only moderate, suggesting that other mechanisms are likely involved in the force recovery process. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors Clinical Physiology and Functional Imaging {\textcopyright} 2012 Scandinavian Society of Clinical Physiology and Nuclear Medicine.},

abstract = {Standing up shifts blood to dependent parts of the body, and blood vessels in the leg become filled. The orthostatic blood volume accumulation in the small vessels is relatively unknown, although these may contribute significantly. We hypothesized that in healthy humans exposed to the upright posture, volume accumulation in small blood vessels contributes significantly to the total fluid volume accumulated in the legs. Considering that near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) tracks postural blood volume changes within the small blood vessels of the lower leg, we evaluated the NIRS-determined changes in oxygenated ($\Delta$[O2Hb]), deoxygenated ($\Delta$[HHb]) and total haemoglobin tissue concentration ($\Delta$[tHb]) and in total leg volume by strain-gauge plethysmography during 70 deg head-up tilt (HUT; n= 7). In a second experiment, spatial and temporal reproducibility were evaluated with three NIRS probes applied on two separate days (n= 8). In response to HUT, an initially fast increase in [O2Hb] was followed by a gradual decline, while [HHb] increased continuously. The increase in [tHb] during HUT was closely related to the increase in total leg volume (r2= 0.95 ± 0.03). After tilt back, [O2Hb] declined below and [HHb] remained above baseline, whereas all NIRS signals gradually returned to baseline. Spatial heterogeneity was observed, and for two probes [tHb] was highly correlated between days (r2= 0.92 ± 0.09 and 0.91 ± 0.12), but less for the third probe (r2= 0.44 ± 0.36). The results suggest a non-linear accumulation of blood volume in the small vessels of the leg, with an initial fast phase followed by a more gradual increase at least partly contributing to the relocation of fluid during orthostatic stress. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {Hemibody movements are strongly considered as being under the control of the contralateral hemisphere of the cerebral cortex. However, some neuroimaging studies have found a bilateral activation of either the primary sensori-motor (SM1) areas or the rostral prefrontal cortex (PFC), during unimanual tasks. More than just bilateral, the activation of these areas was found to be symmetrical in some studies. However, the symmetrical response remains strongly controversial notably for handgrip force generations. We therefore aimed to examine the bilateral SM1 and rostral PFC area activations in response to graded submaximal force generation during a unilateral handgrip task. Fifteen healthy subjects performed 6 levels of force (ranging from 5 to 50% of MVC) during a handgrip task. We concomitantly measured the activation of bilateral SM1 and rostral PFC areas through near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and the electromyographic (EMG) activity of the bilateral flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) muscles. Symmetrical activation was found over the SM1 areas for all the investigated levels of force. At the highest level of force (i.e., 50% of MVC), the EMG of the passive FDS increased significantly and the ipsilateral rostral PFC activation was found more intense than the corresponding contralateral rostral PFC activation. We suggest that the visuo-guided control of force levels during a handgrip task requires the cross-talk from ipsi- to contralateral SM1 to cope for the relative complexity of the task, similar to that which occurs during complex sequential finger movement. We also propose alternative explanations for the observed symmetrical SM1 activation including (i) the ipsilateral corticospinal tract and (ii) interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) mechanism. The increase in EMG activity over the passive FDS could be associated with a release of IHI at 50% of MVC. Finally, our results suggest that the greater ipsilateral (right) rostral PFC activation may reflect the greater demand of attention required to control the motor output at high levels of force. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

The HIIE group performed 4*4 min of high intensity exercise on a cycle ergometer with 3 minutes of active recovery at lower intensities between the bouts, whereas the control group performed no exercise. Prefrontal hemodynamics (oxy and deoxy haemoglobin) were assessed using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during the Colour Word Stroop test (CWST) on two sessions: pre-session and post-session (1 week after pre-session). Results. The results indicate a significant difference in CWST scores which coincided with a significant difference in hemodynamics of PFC between a congruent and a complex incongruent task in the HIIE group. There was a greater activation of the right frontopolar area, the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and the left frontopolar area during the incongruent task in response to acute HIIE. Conclusion. HIIE plays a role in changing brain activation during more complex interference related tasks.},

In this study, brain activity of participants with many and few autistic traits, was recorded using an fNIRS device, as participants preformed an interpersonal synchronization task. This type of task involves synchronization and functional connectivity of different brain regions. A novel method for assessing signal complexity, using $\epsilon$-complexity coefficients, applied for the first i.e. on fNIRS recording, was used to classify brain recording of participants with many/few autistic traits. Successful classification was achieved implying that this method may be useful for classification of fNIRS recordings and that there is a difference in brain activity between participants with low and high autistic traits as they perform an interpersonal synchronization task.},

We investigated orthostatic changes in systemic haemodynamic variables and cerebral oxygenation in 21 elderly patients with heart failure New York Heart Association class I-III in stable condition (age 70-83 years) after withdrawal of furosemide and captopril for 2 weeks, and in 18 healthy elderly subjects (age 70-84 years). Frontal cortical concentration changes of oxyhaemoglobin ([O2Hb]) and deoxyhaemoglobin ([HHb]) were continuously measured by near-infrared spectrophotometry and BP changes by Finapres before and during 10 min of standing. Upon standing [O2Hb] reflecting blood flow, changed by -1.2 ± 0.9 $\mu$mol L-1 (mean ± SEM) in the patients, whereas it decreased by -4.5 ± 0.6 $\mu$mol L-1 (P<0.01) in the healthy subjects after standing (P<0.05 between groups). [HHb] reflecting the sum of cerebral blood flow, arterial oxygen saturation and cerebral oxygen uptake, increased by 1.5 ± 0.5 $\mu$mol L-1 (P<0.05) and 1.7 ± 0.6 $\mu$mol L-1 (P<0.05), respectively. Compared with healthy elderly subjects, elderly patients with left ventricular dysfunction showed smaller orthostatic [O2Hb] decreases (P<0.01), in relation to higher orthostatic BP rises (P<0.05). These findings indicate that BP changes and an altered cardiovascular balance may influence orthostatic cortical haemodynamic responses in elderly subjects.},

No statistical differences were observed in body composition, blood pressure, fasting blood parameters, and resting cardiac adaptations. In conclusion, our study showed, for the first time, that in addition to the differences in the ̇VO2max, a greater increase in microvascular responsiveness in responders compared to non- responders was ob-served. Additionally, responders and non- responders did not show differences in the adaptations  on  metabolic  parameters.

Pulmonary O2 uptake (V̇o 2) and vastus lateralis muscle fractional O2extraction (by near-infrared spectroscopy) were determined during an incremental cycle ergometer (CE) and one-leg knee-extension (KE) exercise. Mitochondrial respiration was evaluated ex vivo by high-resolution respirometry in permeabilized vastus lateralis fibers obtained by biopsy. Quadriceps femoris muscle cross-sectional area, volume (determined by magnetic resonance imaging), and strength were greater in RTA vs. CTRL (by ∼40%, ∼33%, and ∼20%, respectively). V̇o2peak during CE was higher in RTA vs. CTRL (4.05 ± 0.64 vs. 3.56 ± 0.30 l/min); no difference between groups was observed during KE. The O2 cost of CE exercise was not different between groups. When divided per muscle mass (for CE) or quadriceps muscle mass (for KE), V̇o2 peak was lower (by 15-20%) in RTA vs. CTRL. Vastus lateralis fractional O2 extraction was lower in RTA vs. CTRL at all work rates, during both CE and KE. RTA had higher ADP-stimulated mitochondrial respiration (56.7 ± 23.7 pmol O2{\textperiodcentered}s-1{\textperiodcentered}mg -1 ww) vs. CTRL (35.7 ± 10.2 pmol O2{\textperiodcentered}s -1mg-1 ww) and a tighter coupling of oxidative phosphorylation. In RTA, the greater muscle mass and maximal force and the enhanced mitochondrial respiration seem to compensate for the hypertrophy-induced impaired peripheral O2 diffusion. The net results are an enhanced whole body oxidative function at peak exercise and unchanged efficiency and O2 cost at submaximal exercise, despite a much greater body mass.

abstract = {Purpose: This study investigated the effects of repeated-sprint (RS) training in hypoxia induced by voluntary hypoventilation at low lung volume (RSH-VHL) on physiological adaptations, RS ability (RSA) and anaerobic performance. Methods: Over a 3-week period, eighteen well-trained cyclists completed six RS sessions in cycling either with RSH-VHL or with normal conditions (RSN). Before (Pre) and after (Post) the training period, the subjects performed an RSA test (10 × 6-s all-out cycling sprints) during which oxygen uptake (V ˙ O 2) and the change in both muscle deoxyhaemoglobin ($\Delta$[HHb]) and total haemoglobin ($\Delta$[THb]) were measured. A 30-s Wingate test was also performed and maximal blood lactate concentration ([La]max) was assessed. Results: At Post compared to Pre, the mean power output during both the RSA and the Wingate tests was improved in RSH-VHL (846 ± 98 vs 911 ± 117 W and 723 ± 112 vs 768 ± 123 W, p < 0.05) but not in RSN (834 ± 52 vs 852 ± 69 W, p = 0.2; 710 ± 63 vs 713 ± 72 W, p = 0.68). The average V ˙ O 2 recorded during the RSA test was significantly higher in RSH-VHL at Post but did not change in RSN. No change occurred for $\Delta$[THb] whereas $\Delta$[HHb] increased to the same extent in both groups. [Lamax] after the Wingate test was higher in RSH-VHL at Post (13.9 ± 2.8 vs 16.1 ± 3.2 mmol L−1, p < 0.01) and tended to decrease in RSN (p = 0.1). Conclusions: This study showed that RSH-VHL could bring benefits to both RSA and anaerobic performance through increases in oxygen delivery and glycolytic contribution. On the other hand, no additional effect was observed for the indices of muscle blood volume and O2 extraction.},

Fifteen stage 1 hypertensive and normotensive males (19-55 years) were compared on four tests of working memory (digit span and auditory consonant trigrams), and accompanying hemodynamic changes measured by functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). With participants blindfolded, the four tests were randomized while fNIRS was used to monitor bilateral PFC changes in oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb), deoxyhemoglobin (HHb), total hemoglobin (tHb), and hemoglobin difference. The hypertensive group demonstrated significant impairment in performance on the working memory tests with a trend of decreased efficiency performance scores (tests score/O2Hb and tHb changes). Significant correlations were noted in the hypertensive group between test performance and changes in O2Hb and tHb in both the left and right PFC. These findings suggest that fNIRS combined with cognitive testing may provide important measures of cerebrovascular reserve in essential hypertension.},

abstract = {Laparoscopic surgery can be exhausting and frustrating, and the cognitive load experienced by surgeons may have a major impact on patient safety as well as healthcare economics. As cognitive load decreases with increasing proficiency, its robust assessment through physiological data can help to develop more effective training and certification procedures in this area. We measured data from 31 novices during laparoscopic exercises to extract features based on cardiac and ocular variables. These were compared with traditional behavioural and subjective measures in a dual-task setting. We found significant correlations between the features and the traditional measures. The subjective task difficulty, reaction time, and completion time were well predicted by the physiology features. Reaction times to randomly timed auditory stimuli were correlated with the mean of the heart rate (r= - 0.29) and heart rate variability (r= 0.4). Completion times were correlated with the physiologically predicted values with a correlation coefficient of 0.84. We found that the multi-modal set of physiology features was a better predictor than any individual feature and artificial neural networks performed better than linear regression. The physiological correlates studied in this paper, translated into technological products, could help develop standardised and more easily regulated frameworks for training and certification.},

He was analyzed in an ongoing research project aimed at improving methods detecting sport-related leg flow limitations. Results: During functional testing, the ankle-brachial index of the left leg was moderately lowered. However, results of near-infrared spectroscopy and pedal power measurements were largely abnormal suggesting a severe flow limitation. Conclusion: Combining post-exercise ankle-brachial index, near-infrared spectroscopy, and pedal power measurements as routine diagnostic functional testing suggested a severe arterial flow inflow limitation.

abstract = {Fatigability and muscle oxygen consumption (mVO2) during sustained voluntary isometric knee extensions are less at extended (30° knee angle; 07deg;, full extension) versus flexed knee angles (907deg;). This lower energy consumption may partially result from lower neural activation at extended knee angles. We hypothesized a smaller difference in mVO2 between extended and flexed knee angles during electrical stimulation, which guaranteed maximal activation, than during maximal voluntary contractions (MVC). In eight healthy young males, MVC extension torque was obtained at 30°, 607deg; and 907deg; knee angles. mVO2 of the rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL) and medialis muscle was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy during tetanic (10 s) and maximal voluntary (15 s) contractions (MVC15). For electrically induced contractions, steady state mVO2 was reached at similar (P > 0.05) times after torque onset (4.6 ± 0.7 s) at all knee angles. In contrast, during MVC15 at 30° mVO2 was reached at 7.1 ± 1.1 s, significantly later compared to 60° and 907deg; knee angles. The knee angle dependent differences in mVO2 were not lower in electrically induced contractions (as hypothesised) but were similar as in voluntary contractions. Normalized mVO2 at 30° (percentage 90° knee angle) was 79.0 ± 9.4% (across muscles) for electrically induced and 79.5 ± 7.6% (across muscles) for voluntary contractions (P < 0.05). We conclude that the slower onset of mVO2 during voluntary effort at 30° may have been due to a lower maximal activation. However, because steady state mVO2 both during electrically induced and voluntary contractions was ∼20% less at extended versus flexed knee angles, the causes for the lower mVO2 must reside within the muscle itself. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2007.},

abstract = {Background: Hypertension has adverse effects on microvascular function but there are limited methods that permit non-invasive assessment of the microcirculation in man in vivo. We used Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) to assess microvascular reactive hyperaemia in skeletal muscle following a short period of ischemia. We tested if differences between normotensive and hypertensive individuals could be detected. Methods: Older adults enrolled in a population-based cohort study underwent measurements of oxy-Hb changes during a 30-second arterial occlusion and hyperaemic response using NIRS (Portamon, Artinis). Time-to-peak hyperaemic response was calculated. Hypertension diagnosis was determined by questionnaire and clinic blood pressure (BP) (diastolic BP > 90 mmHg or systolic BP > 140 mmHg). Diabetes diagnosis and information about medication were determined by questionnaire. Data are mean (SD) or adjusted mean±SEM. Multivariable linear regression was used. Associations with hypertension were adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity and presence of diabetes. Results: 129 participants (99 = male, 72(6) years old, 74(57%) hypertensive participated). Time-to-peak hyperaemic response was significantly longer in hypertensive than normotensive participants after adjustment for age and gender (12.5±0.49 versus 10.5±0.57seconds, p = 0.06). This association persisted after adjustment for ethnicity and the presence of diabetes (12.6±0.50 versus 10.5±0.57, p = 0.03). Conclusion: Hypertension is associated with impairment of post-ischemic reactive hyperaemia in skeletal muscle microvasculature. Differences between hypertensive and normotensive older adults can be detected non-invasively using NIRS.},

abstract = {We tested hypothesis that cerebral deoxygenation near maximal exercise intensity is mediated by hyperventilation, via hypocapnia-induced reductions in cerebral blood flow, by utilizing canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to determine the relative influence of cardiopulmonary changes on cerebral oxygenation, as assessed by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Twenty-three subjects performed incremental exercise tests under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Changes in ventilation (over(V, ̇)E) were strongly correlated with end-tidal CO2 (PE TC O2) and NIRS after the respiratory compensation point (RCP) (r2 > 0.97). However, in contrast to our expectations, CBF velocity (CBFv) shared the least amount of variance with NIRS measurements (r2 < 0.56) and the reduction in CBFv was not accompanied by a reduction in cerebral blood volume. These results demonstrate that while cerebral deoxygenation was associated with hyperventilation, it was not solely explained by hypocapnia-induced reductions in CBFv. CCA revealed that a relative increase in the venous contribution to NIRS explained a larger amount of variation in cerebral oxygenation than reductions CBFv. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Eighteen untreated hypertensives (44.0 ± 2.6 years) consumed randomly, a nitrate-rich (8.1 mmol-BRJ nitrate ) and a nitrate-depleted (BRJ placebo ) BRJ. Office BP and pulse wave velocity were assessed before/after BRJ. An occlusion-reperfusion maneuver with continuous monitoring of muscle oxygenated hemoglobin (O 2 Hb) and total hemoglobin (tHb), via NIRS, followed. Participants performed submaximal isometric handgrip with beat-by-beat monitoring of hemodynamics and cBRS. Ambulatory BP assessment followed. Results: During reperfusion, following arterial occlusion, the magnitude and rate of muscle microvascular reoxygenation (O 2 Hb) and red blood cell content (tHb) were higher in BRJ nitrate vs BRJ placebo (P < 0.05), suggesting improved microvascular reactivity.

During isometric handgrip, BP and peripheral resistance rise were smaller in BRJ nitrate vs BRJ placebo (P < 0.01-0.05), with no differences in cBRS. Conclusions: In drug-na{\"{i}}ve hypertensives, a single dose of BRJ induces (a) short-term reductions in resting/ambulatory BP, (b) acute improvements in muscle microvascular function, and (c) attenuation in BP and peripheral resistance responses during isometric exercise.},

abstract = {Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are reported to have limited exercise capacity. There is no consensus about a possible abnormality in skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism in CF. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that abnormalities in oxygenation and/or muscle oxidative metabolism contribute to exercise intolerance in adolescents with mild CF. Ten adolescents with CF (12-18 years of age; forced expiratory volume in 1 s >80% of predicted; and resting oxygen saturation >94%) and 10 healthy age-matched control (HC) subjects were tested with supine cycle ergometry using near-infrared spectroscopy and 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy to study skeletal muscle oxygenation and oxidative metabolism during rest, exercise and recovery. No statistically significant (P > 0.1) differences in peak workload and peak oxygen uptake per kilogram lean body mass were found between CF and HC subjects. No differences were found between CF and HC subjects in bulk changes of quadriceps phosphocreatine (P = 0.550) and inorganic phosphate (P = 0.896) content and pH (P = 0.512) during symptom-limited exercise. Furthermore, we found statistically identical kinetics for phosphocreatine resynthesis during recovery for CF and HC subjects (P = 0.53). No statistically significant difference in peak exercise arbitrary units for total haemoglobin content was found between CF and HC subjects (P = 0.66). The results of this study provide evidence that in patients with mild CF and a stable clinical status (without signs of systemic inflammation and/or chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization), no intrinsic metabolic constraints and/or abnormalities in oxygenation and/or muscle oxidative metabolism contribute to exercise intolerance.},

abstract = {Individual differences in the temporal dynamics of the haemodynamic response can reflect cortical excitation and can reveal underlying cortical physiology. Here, we show differences in the shape of the haemodynamic response that are dependent on stimulus parameters. Two sets of visual stimuli were used varying in parameters that are known to manipulate the haemodynamic response in the visual cortex. We measured the oxyhaemoglobin response using near infrared spectroscopy. The first set of stimuli comprised chromatic square-wave gratings that varied with respect to the separation in the CIE UCS chromaticities of the alternating bars. The gratings with large separations in chromaticity evoked an oxyhaemoglobin response with greater amplitude, consistent with greater activation of the visual cortex. The second set of stimuli comprised horizontal achromatic gratings that (1) were static, (2) drifted at a constant velocity towards fixation, or (3) reversed direction every half spatial cycle to create a vertical vibrating motion. Although the three types of grating had a similar effect on the amplitude of the oxyhaemoglobin response, the moving gratings (2 and 3) evoked a steeper decrease in oxyhaemoglobin concentration after stimulus-offset. The steeper slope appears to reflect the post-stimulus undershoot and the slope may provide a correlate of cortical excitability when the amplitude of the haemodynamic response has saturated.},

abstract = {Background Deficits in frontal lobe perfusion have been demonstrated in late-life depression; however, studies to date have generally involved small numbers, used neuroimaging rather than bedside testing and have not controlled for important covariates.Aims We aimed to examine the association between depressive symptoms and frontal lobe perfusion during standing, in a large cohort of community-dwelling older people.Method Participants aged ≥50 years underwent continuous measurement of orthostatic blood pressure by finometry, and frontal lobe perfusion by near-infrared spectroscopy. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the eight-item Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. Real-Time frontal lobe cerebral oxygenation was measured by the Portalite System, detecting changes in frontal lobe perfusion and reporting a tissue saturation index score.Results Almost 8% (209 out of 2616) had clinically significant depressive symptoms. Multilevel models demonstrated a significantly lower tissue saturation index in participants with depressive symptoms at both 60 and 90 s post-stand, with coefficients of-0.43 (95% CI-0.63 to-0.22) and-0.37 (95% CI-0.57 to-0.16), respectively. Controlling for relevant covariates did not significantly attenuate these associations. After addition of systolic blood pressure this association was no longer significant, suggesting lower blood pressure may modify this relationship.Conclusions This study demonstrates that lower frontal lobe perfusion, related to lower values of baseline systolic blood pressure, is associated with clinically significant depressive symptoms in a cohort of community-dwelling older people. Given the recognised longitudinal association between lower blood pressure and depression in older people, this may represent a potential therapeutic target for prevention of incident depression.Declaration of interest None.},

A total of 19 young adults (18–22 years) and 37 older ones (60–77 years) with a high or low CRF level were recruited to perform a working memory updating task under three different cognitive load conditions. Prefrontal cortex hemodynamic responses were continuously recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy, and behavioral performances and perceived difficulty were measured. Results showed that chronological age had deleterious effects on both cognitive performance and prefrontal cortex activation under a higher cognitive load. In older adults, however, higher levels of CRF were related to increased bilateral prefrontal cortex activation patterns that allowed them to sustain better cognitive performances, especially under the highest cognitive load.

Methods: Twenty healthy adults (12 M/8 F) were randomly assigned to perform two ITL tests while breathing a normoxic or hypoxic (FIO2 = 15 %) gas mixture. NIRS devices were placed over the SCM, PS, SA, and a control muscle, tibialis anterior (TA), to monitor oxygenated (O2Hb), deoxygenated (HHb), total hemoglobin (tHb) and tissue saturation index (TSI). With the nose occluded, subjects breathed normally for 4 min through a mouthpiece that was connected to a weighted threshold loading device. ITL began by adding a 100-g weight to the ITL device. Then, every 2 min 50-g was added until task failure. Vital signs, ECG and ventilatory measures were monitored throughout the protocol. Result: Participants were 31 ± 12 year and had normal spirometry. At task failure, the maximum load and ventilatory parameters did not differ between the hypoxic and normoxic ITL. At hypoxic ITL task failure, SpO2 was significantly lower, and ∆HHb increased more so in SA, SCM and PS than normoxic values. SCM ∆TSI decreased more so during hypoxic compared to normoxic ITL. ∆tHb in the inspiratory muscles (SCM, PS and SA) increased significantly compared to the decrease in TA during both hypoxic and normoxic ITL. Conclusion: The SCM, an accessory inspiratory muscle was the most vulnerable to deoxygenation during incremental loading and this response was accentuated by acute hypoxia.},

abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) not only offers great opportunities in terms of entertainment, it is also widely applicable in the field of attention guidance, medicine and psychology. The distinction between VR and ordinary media is the 360$$^\circ $$ - also known as omnidirectional - environment. When applying the option of an omnidirectional platform with auditory as well as visual actions, the focus on the right story line within VR is crucial. In order to analyze whether attention guidance in VR activates the same brain regions as in the real world, data of both topographical brain views must be compared. To do so, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a brain imaging technology, is being utilized. fNIRS is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique, which measures brain oxygenation and by that identifies brain activity. The fNIRS method offers a fast and convenient application and is easily adaptable to the field of VR. In this experiment, the brain activity of 23 participants was examined under two scenarios. The first scenario required the location of click noises when being present in the real world, while the second scenario demanded the same in the virtual reality. The environment of both settings - in the real world as well as in the virtual world - were identical. Each brain picture was analyzed on the basis of a within-subject design. Therefore, all participants were required to experience both settings while wearing fNIRS in order to compare similarities and differences of the recordings. Once all 46 recordings were allocated and broken down by milliseconds, a cortex view through Oxysoft - a software that analyzes and evaluates NIRS recordings - was generated. Despite fNIRS limited recording depth, increased brain activity was detected during the subject's click orientation. The greatest disparity between the resting phase and the stimulation was visible in the temporal as well as the parietal lobe. Findings also showed that in spite of the stimulated brain regions, the hemoglobin level remained the same in both environments, the real world and the virtual world.},

abstract = {In recent years there has been increasing interest in the more extensive application of proton therapy in a clinical and preferably hospital-based environment. However, broader adoption of proton therapy has been hindered by the costs of treatment, which are still much higher than those in advanced photon therapy. This article presents an overview of on-going technical developments, which have a reduction of the capital investment or operational costs either as a major goal or as a potential outcome. Developments in instrumentation for proton therapy, such as gantries and accelerators, as well as facility layout and efficiency in treatment logistics will be discussed in this context. Some of these developments are indeed expected to reduce the costs. The examples will show, however, that a dramatic cost reduction of proton therapy is not expected in the near future. Although current developments will certainly contribute to a gradual decrease of the treatment costs in the coming years, many steps will still have to be made to achieve a much lower cost per treatment.},

First published July 23, 2020; doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.00017.2020.—Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) provides a simple and reliable measure of skeletal muscle oxidative capacity; however, its relationship to aerobic fitness and sex are unclear. We hypothesized that NIRS-derived oxidative capacity in the vastus lateralis (VL) and medial gastrocnemius (MG) would be correlated with indices of aerobic fitness and independent of sex. Twenty-six participants (13 males, 13 females) performed ramp- and step-incremental tests to volitional exhaustion on separate days to establish maximal oxygen uptake (V̇ O2 m a x), peak power output (PPO), lactate threshold (LT), gas exchange threshold (GET), respiratory compensation point (RCP), and maximal fat oxidation (MFO). Data were normalized to lean body mass to account for sex-based differences in body composition. Exercise tests were preceded by duplicate measurements of NIRS-derived oxidative capacity on the VL and MG muscles (i.e., repeated arterial occlusions following a brief set of muscle contractions). Skeletal muscle oxidative capacity for the VL (means ± SD: 21.9 ± 4.6 s) and MG (22.5 ± 6.1 s) were similar but unrelated (r2 = 0.03, P = 0.39). Skeletal muscle oxidative capacity for the VL, but not the MG (P > 0.05 for all variables), was significantly correlated with V̇ O2 m a x (r2 = 0.24; P = 0.01), PPO (r2 = 0.23; P = 0.01), LT (r2 = 0.23; P = 0.01), GET (r2 = 0.23; P = 0.01), and RCP (r2 = 0.27; P = 0.006). MFO was not correlated with VL or MG skeletal muscle oxidative capacity (P > 0.05). Females (54.9 ± 4.5 mL{\textperiodcentered}kg LBM−1{\textperiodcentered}min−1) and males (56.0 ± 6.2 mL{\textperiodcentered}kg LBM−1{\textperiodcentered}min−1), matched for V̇ O2m ax (P = 0.62), had similar NIRS-derived oxidative capacities for VL (20.7 ± 4.4 vs. 23.2 ± 4.6 s; P = 0.18) and MG (24.4 ± 6.8 vs. 20.5 ± 4.8 s; P = 0.10). Overall, NIRS-derived skeletal muscle oxidative capacity in VL is indicative of aerobic fitness and independent of sex in humans. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can be used to measure skeletal muscle oxidative capacity. Here, we demonstrated that NIRS-derived skeletal muscle oxidative capacity of the vastus lateralis was independent of sex, reliable across and within days, and correlated with maximal and submaximal indices of aerobic fitness, including maximal oxygen uptake, lactate threshold, and respiratory compensation point. These findings highlight the utility of NIRS for investigating skeletal muscle oxidative capacity in females and males. fat oxidation; lactate threshold; maximal oxygen uptake; reliability; vastus lateralis},

abstract = {Fatigue resistance of knee extensor muscles is higher during voluntary isometric contractions at short compared with longer muscle lengths. In the present study we hypothesized that this would be due to lower energy consumption, at short muscle lengths. Ten healthy male subjects performed isometric contractions with the knee extensor muscles at a 30, 60, and 90° knee angle (full extension = 0°). At each angle, muscle oxygen consumption (mV̇O2) of the rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, and vastus medialis muscle was obtained with near-infrared spectroscopy. mV̇O 2 was measured during maximal isometric contractions and during contractions at 10, 30, and 50% of maximal torque capacity. During all contractions, blood flow to the muscle was occluded with a pressure cuff (450 mmHg). mV̇O2 significantly (P < 0.05) increased with torque and at all torque levels, and for each of the three muscles mV̇O2 was significantly lower at 30° compared with 60° and 90° and mV̇O2 was similar (P > 0.05) at 60° and 90°. Across all torque levels, average (± SD) mV̇O2 at the 30° angle for vastus medialis, rectus femoris, and vastus lateralis, respectively, was 70.0 ± 10.4, 72.2 ± 12.7, and 75.9 ± 8.0% of the average mV̇O2 obtained for each torque at 60 and 90°. In conclusion, oxygen consumption of the knee extensors was significantly lower during isometric contractions at the 30° than at the 60° and 90° knee angle, which probably contributes to the previously reported longer duration of sustained isometric contractions at relatively short muscle lengths.

Methods: Seventeen recreationally active cyclists performed 6 stages of constant load cycling using cadences of 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 and 110 rpm. Joint specific power was calculated using inverse dynamics and mVO2 and oxygenation were measured using near-infrared spectroscopy. Results: Increasing cadence led to increased knee joint power and decreased hip joint power while the ankle joint was unaffected. Increasing cadence also led to an increased deoxygenation in both the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis. Vastus lateralis mVO2 increased when cadence was increased. No effect of cadence was found for vastus medialis mVO2. Conclusion: This study demonstrates a different effect of cadence on the mVO2 of the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis. The combined mVO2 of the vastus lateralis and medialis showed a linear increase with increasing knee joint specific power, demonstrating that the muscles combined related to power generated over the joint.},

We also determined the influence of 2 exercise modalities (ergometer and rubber exercise bands) on the NIRS measurements. Fifteen young, healthy participants (5 female, 10 male) were tested on 2 nonconsecutive occasions within an 8-day period. The NIRS device was placed on the medial gastrocnemius. Venous and arterial occlusions were performed to obtain blood flow and oxygen consumption. A series of repeated arterial occlusions was used to measure the recovery kinetics of muscle oxygen consumption after$\sim$7-10 s of voluntary plantar flexion exercise. Resting blood flow had mean coefficients of variation (CV) of 42% and 38% for bands and ergometer, respectively, and resting metabolism had mean CVs of 17% and 12% for bands and ergometer, respectively. The recovery time constant of oxygen consumption (day 1 bands and ergometer: 23.2 ± 3.7 s, 27.6 ± 6.5 s, respectively; day 2 bands and ergometer: 25.5 ± 5.4 s, 25.0 ± 4.9 s, respectively) had mean CVs of 10% and 11% for bands and ergometer, respectively. We conclude that measurements of oxygen consumption and mitochondrial capacity using NIRS can be obtained with good reproducibility.},

abstract = {Background and Purpose: Persons with vestibular disorders are known to have slower gait speed with greater imbalance and veering during dual-task walking than healthy individuals, but the cerebral mechanisms are unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine whether individuals with visual vertigo (VV) have different cerebral activation during dual-task walking compared with control subjects. Methods: Fourteen individuals with VV and 14 healthy controls (CON) were included (mean 39 years old, 85% women). A cross-sectional experimental study consisting of 4 combinations of 2 surfaces (even and uneven) and 2 task conditions (single- and dual-task) was performed. Participants walked over an even (level flooring) or uneven (wood prisms underneath carpeting) surface, either quietly or while reciting every other letter of the alphabet. Changes in cerebral activation over the bilateral prefrontal cortices were recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy during 4 task conditions relative to quiet standing. Gait speed and cognitive performance were recorded. Results: There were no between-group differences in cognitive performance. Both groups slowed when walking on an uneven surface or performing a dual-task; participants in the VV group walked more slowly than those in the CON group in all conditions. Participants with VV had decreased cerebral activation in the bilateral prefrontal regions in comparison to CON participants in all conditions. Discussion and Conclusions: Participants with VV had lower prefrontal cortex activation than CON participants during dual-task walking. Lower cortical activity in those with VV may be due to shifted attention away from the cognitive task to prioritize maintenance of dynamic balance.

This study evaluates the effect of BJ consumption on macrovascular endothelial function (flow-mediated dilation (FMD)) and muscle oxygen saturation (StO2) parameters in pregnant women within a randomised, crossover, double-blind design in which twelve pregnant women consumed a single dose (140 ml) of BJ or placebo (PLA). Urinary nitrate was assessed before (T0) and 150 min after BJ/PLA consumption. FMD was used to evaluate macrovascular endothelial function, and near-IR spectroscopy was used to evaluate muscle StO2 parameters during the occlusion and reperfusion phases, which were taken at baseline (PRE) and 120 and 140 min after BJ/PLA consumption, respectively. A significant increase in urinary nitrate was observed at 150 min after BJ consumption when compared with T0 (BJ: 0{\textperiodcentered}20 (sd 0{\textperiodcentered}13) v. T0: 0{\textperiodcentered}02 (sd 0{\textperiodcentered}00), P=0{\textperiodcentered}000) and PLA intervention (PLA: 0{\textperiodcentered}02 (sd 0{\textperiodcentered}00), P=0{\textperiodcentered}001).

No significant difference between PLA and PRE in FMD (P=1{\textperiodcentered}000) was observed. In StO2 parameters, a difference was not observed after BJ consumption compared with PRE and PLA intervention.

Due to its infancy, there are still no standard approaches for meaningful features and classifiers for single trial analysis of fNIRS. Most studies are limited to established classifiers from EEG-based BCIs and very simple features. The feasibility of more complex and powerful classification approaches like Deep Neural Networks has, to the best of our knowledge, not been investigated for fNIRS based BCI. These networks have recently become increasingly popular, as they outperformed conventional machine learning methods for a variety of tasks, due in part to advances in training methods for neural networks. In this paper, we show how Deep Neural Networks can be used to classify brain activation patterns measured by fNIRS and compare them with previously used methods.},

abstract = {Background and Purpose - With increasing age, assuming the upright position is more often accompanied by symptoms such as dizziness and lightheadedness, possibly as a result of a diminished oxygen supply to the brain due to impaired cerebral autoregulation. We aimed to quantify postural changes in cerebral oxygenation and systemic hemodynamics in healthy elderly and young subjects. Methods - In 18 healthy elderly subjects (aged 70 to 83 years) and 10 healthy young subjects (aged 22 to 45 years), frontal cortical oxygenation and hemodynamic responses were continuously monitored by near infrared spectroscopy and Finapres, respectively, before and during 10 minutes of active standing. Results - Cortical oxyhemoglobin concentration [O2Hb] decreased by -4.6±2.2 $\mu$mol/L (P<0.001) and cortical deoxyhemoglobin concentration increased by 1.5±2.4 $\mu$mol/L (P<0.05) in the elderly subjects after posture change, whereas these variables did not change significantly in the young subjects. The postural hemodynamic changes tended to be attenuated in the elderly subjects, except for the increases in systolic blood pressure (BP). Smaller postural increases in diastolic BP were related to larger [O2Hb] decreases (r=0.53, P<0.01, corrected for the age effect). Conclusions - Assuming the upright position evokes an asymptomatic decrease in frontal cortical oxygenation in healthy elderly subjects but not in healthy young subjects. Cortical [O2Hb] changes are affected by diastolic BP changes. These findings may indicate that regulation of cerebral oxygenation alters with increasing age.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Control of micturition is dependent upon an extensive brain neural network. Cortical activity related to pelvic floor muscle (PFM) contractions has been demonstrated using fMRI but is not in routine clinical care due to expense, limited access and restriction to the supine position. Functional near infra-red spectroscopy (fNIRS) which detects changes in oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb) and deoxyhemoglobin (hHb) concentrations is non invasive, maps cortical activity in real time and allows upright posture. Objective: examine patterns of frontal cortical brain O2Hb using fNIRS during PFM contraction and relaxation at capacity and related to voluntary uroflow in natural voiding posture. METHODS: N=12 studies; subjects, healthy volunteers, men (age 24-55 yrs), women (age 24-78 yrs). A protocol proving PFM control by fMRI was replicated then extended to include spontaneous voiding, uroflow and post void residual urine. fNIRS was performed using a 4x4 optode grid (Artinis Medical Systems) over the frontal cortex, at 10 Hz. At bladder capacity, following natural filling subjects imitated voiding by releasing or imitated interruption of voiding by contracting PFMs for 10 sec over 10 repetitions followed by voluntary voiding (seated or standing for males). O2Hb and hHb patterns were captured, then linked to uroflow in video format. RESULTS: In men and women PFM contraction and relaxation induced a repetitive activation pattern in the frontal cortex with increases in DO2Hb evident. There was an increase in DO2Hb detectable in the lateral prefrontal area (Brodmann's areas) following permission to void at capacity with urge. Fig 1: demonstration of cerebral O2Hb static images from fNIRS video before permission to void (A), following permission to void (B), at Q max (C) and following voiding (D). CONCLUSIONS: A clinical protocol for fNIRS mapping to detect activation of the frontal cortical micturition region during voluntary uroflow and during PFM is presented for future clinical studies. To our knowledge, this is the first study confirming fNIRS activation patterns detected during micturition-related activity in cortical structures during natural voiding posture corresponding to those previously demonstrated in fMRI.},

abstract = {Purpose: Previous work identified an asymmetry in tissue desaturation changes in the left and right quadriceps muscles during on-ice skating at maximal speed in males. The effect of changing race distance on the magnitude of desaturation or leg asymmetry is unknown. Methods: Six elite male skaters (age = 23 ± 1.8 yr, height = 1.8 ± 0.1 m, mass = 80.1 ± 5.7 kg, midthigh skinfold thickness = 7 ± 2 mm) and four elite female skaters (age = 21 ± 4 yr, height = 1.6 ± 0.1 m, mass = 65.2 ± 4.3 kg, midthigh skinfold thickness = 10 ± 1 mm) were studied. Subjects completed time trials over three race distances. Blood lactate concentration and O2 uptake measurements were combined with near-infrared spectroscopy measures of muscle oxygenation (TSI) and blood volume (tHb) in the right and left vastus lateralis. Results: Neither race distance nor gender had a significant effect on the magnitude of maximal muscle desaturation ($\Delta$TSImax). Pattern of local changes in tHb during individual laps was dependent upon subtle differences in skating technique used for the different race distances. Linear regression analysis revealed asymmetry between the right and left leg desaturation in males during the final stages of each race distance, but not in females. At all race distances, local muscle desaturation reached maximal values much more quickly than global V̇O2peak. Conclusion: The use of wearable near-infrared spectroscopy devices enabled measurement of muscle oxygenation during competitive race simulation, thus providing unique insight into the effects of velocity and technique changes on local muscle oxygenation. This may have implications for training and race pacing in speed skating. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the American College of Sports Medicine.},

abstract = {Several neuroimaging studies of cognitive aging revealed deficits in episodic memory abilities as a result of prefrontal cortex (PFC) limitations. Improving episodic memory performance despite PFC deficits is thus a critical issue in aging research. Listening to music stimulates cognitive performance in several non-purely musical activities (e.g., language and memory). Thus, music could represent a rich and helpful source during verbal encoding and therefore help subsequent retrieval. Furthermore, such benefit could be reflected in less demand of PFC, which is known to be crucial for encoding processes. This study aimed to investigate whether music may improve episodic memory in older adults while decreasing the PFC activity. Sixteen healthy older adults ($\mu$ = 64.5 years) encoded lists of words presented with or without a musical background while their dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity was monitored using a eight-channel continuous-wave near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) system (Oxymon Mk III, Artinis, The Netherlands). Behavioral results indicated a better source-memory performance for words encoded with music compared to words encoded with silence (p < 0.05). Functional NIRS data revealed bilateral decrease of oxyhemoglobin values in the music encoding condition compared to the silence condition (p < 0.05), suggesting that music modulates the activity of the DLPFC during encoding in a less-demanding direction.Taken together, our results indicate that music can help older adults in memory performances by decreasing their PFC activity.These findings open new perspectives about music as tool for episodic memory rehabilitation on special populations with memory deficits due to frontal lobe damage such as Alzheimer's patients. {\textcopyright} 2014 Ferreri, Bigand, Perrey, Muthalib, Bard and Bugaiska.},

During progressive loading, the PS and IC showed a significant increase in oxygenated hemoglobin (5.9±2.3 and 6.8±2.4$\mu$M, P<0.05) and the SCM showed an increase in deoxygenated hemoglobin (17.3±3.8$\mu$M, P<0.05). Total hemoglobin also steadily increased in the SCM whereas it decreased in the quiescent vastus lateralis muscle (20.7±6.1$\mu$M vs. -6.6±2.4$\mu$M, P<0.05), which was used as the control muscle during the ITL. Our data suggests that the SCM is recruited progressively during progressive ITL and is accompanied by an increased blood volume and maintenance of O 2Hb. Blood redistribution away from the nonactive limb muscles during the ITL may provide one source of maintaining inspiratory muscle blood volume and oxygenation during high respiratory motor output. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Prior peripheral hypoxia induced via remote ischemic preconditioning (IPC) can improve physical performance in male athletes through improved O2 delivery and utilization. Since females may have an innate protective mechanism against ischemia-reperfusion injury, and since muscle metabolism during contraction differs between sexes, it is relevant to examine the impact of sex in response to IPC to determine whether it is also ergogenic in females. In a randomized, crossover, single-blind study, we investigated muscle performance, hemodynamic and O2 uptake in strength-trained males (n = 9) and females (n = 8) performing five sets of 5 maximum voluntary knee extensions on an isokinetic dynamometer, preceded by either IPC (3 × 5-min ischemia/5-min reperfusion cycles at 200 mmHg) or SHAM (20 mmHg). Changes in deoxy-hemoglobin ($\Delta$[HHb], expressed in percentage of arterial occlusion and considered an index of O2 extraction), and total hemoglobin ($\Delta$[THb]) concentrations of the vastus lateralis muscle were continuously monitored by near-infrared spectroscopy. The metabolic efficiency of the contractions was calculated as the average force/$\Delta$[HHb]avg ratio. Cohen's effect sizes (ES) ± 90% confidence limits were used to estimate IPC-induced changes and sex differences. IPC increased total muscular force in males only (13.0%, ES 0.64, 0.37;0.90), and this change was greater than in females (10.4% difference, ES 0.40, 0.10;0.70). Percent force decrement was only attenuated in females (-19.8%, ES -0.38, -0.77;0.01), which was clearly different than males (sex difference: ES 0.45, -0.16;1.07). IPC also induced different changes between sexes for average muscle O2 uptake in set 2 (males: 6.4% vs. females: -16.7%, ES 0.21, -0.18;0.60), set 3 (males: 7.0% vs. females: -44.4%, ES 0.56, -0.17;1.29), set 4 (males: 9.1% vs. females: -40.2%, ES 0.51, -0.10;1.13), and set 5 (males: 10.2% vs. females: -40.4%, ES 0.52, -0.04;1.09). However, metabolic efficiency was not meaningfully different between conditions and sexes. IPC increased muscle blood volume (↑[THb]) at rest and during recovery between sets, to the same extent in both sexes. Despite a similar IPC-induced initial increase in O2 delivery in both sexes, males displayed greater peripheral O2 extraction and greater strength enhancement. This ergogenic effect appears to be mediated in part via an up regulated oxidative function in males. We conclude that strength-trained males might benefit more from IPC than their female counterparts during repeated, maximal efforts.},

abstract = {Background. In a randomized control trial conducted in patients with Parkinson's disease, a treadmill training program combined with virtual reality that targeted motor and cognitive aspects of safe ambulation led to fewer falls, compared with treadmill training alone. Objective. To investigate if the 2 types of training differentially affected prefrontal activation and if this might explain differences in fall rates after the intervention. Methods. Sixty-four patients with Parkinson's disease were randomized into the treadmill training arm (n = 34, mean age 73.1 ± 1.1 years, 64% men, disease duration 9.7 ± 1.0 years) or treadmill training with virtual reality arm (n = 30, mean age 70.1 ± 1.3 years, 71% men, disease duration 8.9 ± 1.1 years). Prefrontal activation during usual, dual-task, and obstacle negotiation walking was assessed before and after 6 weeks of training, using a functional near-infrared spectroscopy system. Results. Treadmill training with and without virtual reality reduced prefrontal activation during walking (P <.001), with specific interactions related to training arm (P =.01), lateralization (P =.05), and walking condition (P =.001). For example, among the subjects who trained with treadmill training alone, prefrontal activation during dual-task walking and obstacle negotiation increased after training, while in the combined training arm, activation decreased. Conclusions. Prefrontal activation during usual and during more challenging walking conditions can be altered in response to 2 different types of training. The addition of a cognitive training component to a treadmill exercise program apparently modifies the effects of the training on the magnitude and lateralization of prefrontal activation and on falls, extending the understanding of the plasticity of the brain in PD.},

abstract = {Nitrate derived from vegetables is consumed as part of a normal diet and is reduced endogenously via nitrite to nitric oxide. It has been shown to improve endothelial function, reduce blood pressure and the oxygen cost of sub-maximal exercise, and increase regional perfusion in the brain. The current study assessed the effects of dietary nitrate on cognitive performance and prefrontal cortex cerebral blood-flow (CBF) parameters in healthy adults. In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-groups study, 40 healthy adults received either placebo or 450. ml beetroot juice ($\sim$. 5.5. mmol nitrate). Following a 90. minute drink/absorption period, participants performed a selection of cognitive tasks that activate the frontal cortex for 54. min. Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to monitor CBF and hemodynamics, as indexed by concentration changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated-haemoglobin, in the frontal cortex throughout. The bioconversion of nitrate to nitrite was confirmed in plasma by ozone-based chemi-luminescence. Dietary nitrate modulated the hemodynamic response to task performance, with an initial increase in CBF at the start of the task period, followed by consistent reductions during the least demanding of the three tasks utilised. Cognitive performance was improved on the serial 3s subtraction task. These results show that single doses of dietary nitrate can modulate the CBF response to task performance and potentially improve cognitive performance, and suggest one possible mechanism by which vegetable consumption may have beneficial effects on brain function.},

abstract = {New Findings: What is the central question of this study? Does ischaemic preconditioning (IPC) influence central and peripheral fatiguing mechanisms during sustained maximal isometric exercise? What is the main finding and its importance? Voluntary activation and pre- to postexercise reductions in resting twitch torque values were unchanged by IPC. However, an effect on tissue oxygenation was observed within the IPC trials, where greater concentrations of deoxyhaemoglobin were recorded with concurrent upward trends of total haemoglobin concentrations. Using a direct assessment of neural drive, we found that IPC had no influence on either central or peripheral fatiguing pathways after maximal isometric exercise. Abstract: Ischaemic preconditioning (IPC) is thought to inhibit neural feedback from metabolically sensitive muscle afferents during exercise. It was hypothesized that IPC could affect mechanisms associated with centrally mediated fatigue after a maximally fatiguing protocol. Eleven resistance-trained men completed three 2 min maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) via an isometric leg extension preceded by treatments of IPC (three bouts of 5 min bilateral leg occlusions at 220 mmHg), SHAM (three bouts of 5 min at 20 mmHg) or CON (30 min passive rest). Femoral nerve stimulation was used to explore central and peripheral fatigue pathways. These pathways were profiled at baseline (BL), before the 2 min MVC (Pre) and 10 s afterwards (Post). Tissue oxygenation was measured throughout the 2 min MVCs via near-infrared spectroscopy. The Pre to Post MVC (−71 ± 56 Nm; d = 1.33 ± 0.51, P < 0.01) and twitch torque (−51 ± 20 Nm; d = 3.76 ± 0.84, P < 0.01) levels declined without differences between conditions (MVC, P = 0.67; twitch torque, P = 0.39). Voluntary activation was also unaffected by condition (P = 0.80). Peak deoxyhaemoglobin concentrations were elevated in the IPC trials relative to CON (3.7 ± 3.0 $\mu$mol l−1; d = 1.02 ± 0.46, P < 0.01) and SHAM (3.0 ± 3.7 $\mu$mol l−1; d = 0.82 ± 0.57, P < 0.05). These findings demonstrate that IPC does not affect central or peripherally mediated mechanisms of fatigue during a sustained 2 min maximal effort isometric leg-extension task.},

abstract = {Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) may enhance exercise performance. Cardioprotective effects of IPC are known to re-occur 24 h after the stimulus. Whether the delayed effect of IPC has similar effects as IPC on exercise performance is unknown. Objectives Examine whether IPC applied 24 h (24-IPC) before exercise is equally effective as IPC in improving exercise performance. Design Randomized, cross-over study Methods 12 healthy participants were randomly exposed to SHAM-session, IPC or 24-IPC before a self-paced 5 km running trial on a treadmill. Subjects were blinded for time, speed and heart rate. Furthermore, heart rate, BORG, and the local tissue saturation index were measured during exercise, while lactate levels were determined after running. Using a regression model, we explored whether these parameters predicted the change in running time after IPC and 24-IPC. Results We found no differences in finish time after IPC (SHAM: 1400 ± 105 s, IPC: 1381 ± 112 s, 24-IPC: 1385 ± 113 s; p = 0.30). However, we observed a significant positive relation between the change in finish time after IPC and 24-IPC (p = 0.016; r = 0.677). Using stepwise linear regression, a lower post-exercise blood lactate level after IPC or 24-IPC was significantly related to an improvement in finish time (R2 = 0.47, $\beta$ = -0.687, p = 0.007). Conclusions Although no significant effect of IPC or 24-IPC on exercise performance was found, individual finish time after IPC and 24-IPC were strongly correlated. Therefore, our data suggest that, at the individual level, the effects of 24-IPC are closely related to the effects of IPC.},

abstract = {Artificial gravity has been proposed as a method to counteract the physiological deconditioning of long-duration spaceflight; however, the effects of hypergravity on the central nervous system has had little study. The study aims investigate whether there is a relationship between prefrontal cortex brain activity and prefrontal cortex oxygenation during exposure hypergravity. Twelve healthy participants were selected to undergo hypergravity exposure aboard a short-arm human centrifuge. Participants were exposed to hypergravity in the +Gz axis, starting from 0.6 +Gz for women, and 0.8 +Gz for men, and gradually increasing by 0.1 +Gz until the participant showed signs of syncope. Brain cortical activity was measured using electroencephalography (EEG) and localized to the prefrontal cortex using standard low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Prefrontal cortex oxygenation was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). significant increase in prefrontal cortex activity (P < 0.05) was observed during hypergravity exposure compared with baseline. Prefrontal cortex oxygenation was significantly decreased during hypergravity exposure, with a decrease in oxyhemoglobin levels (P < 0.05) compared with baseline and an increase in deoxyhemoglobin levels (P < 0.05) with increasing +Gz level. No significant correlation was found between prefrontal cortex activity and oxy-/deoxyhemoglobin. It is concluded that the increase in prefrontal cortex activity observed during hypergravity was most likely not the result of increased +Gz values resulting in a decreased oxygenation produced through hypergravity exposure. No significant relationship between prefrontal cortex activity and oxygenation measured by NIRS concludes that brain activity during exposure to hypergravity may be difficult to measure using NIRS. Instead, the increase in prefrontal cortex activity might be attributable to psychological stress, which could pose a problem for the use of a short-arm human centrifuge as a countermeasure.

The aim of the study was to use noninvasive functional evaluation methods, specifically aimed at skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism, to evaluate the effects of an aerobic exercise training (cycle ergometer, 12 wk, 4 days/wk, 65-70% of maximal heart rate) in 6 MM and 7 McA. Oxygen uptake and skeletal muscle vastus lateralis fractional O2 extraction by near-infrared spectroscopy were assessed during incremental and low-intensity constant work rate (CWR) exercises before (BEFORE) and at the end (AFTER) of training. Peak O2 uptake increased significantly with training both in MM [14.7 1.2 vs. 17.6 1.4 mlkg1min1 (mean SD)] and in McA (18.5 1.8 mlkg1min1 vs. 21.6 1.9). Peak skeletal muscle fractional O2 extraction increased with training both in MM (22.0 6.7 vs. 32.6 5.9%) and in McA (18.5 6.2 vs. 37.2 7.2%). During low-intensity CWR in both MM and McA: V ? O2 kinetics became faster in AFTER, but only in the patients with slow V ? O2 kinetics in BEFORE; the transient overshoot in fractional O2 extraction kinetics disappeared. The level of habitual physical activity was not higher 3 mo after training (FOLLOW-UP vs. PRE). In MM and McA patients a homebased aerobic training program significantly attenuated the impairment of skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism and improved variables associated with exercise tolerance. Our findings indicate that in MM and McA patients near-infrared spectroscopy and V ? O2 kinetics can effectively detect the functional improvements obtained by training.},

Thus, the current study investigated the effects of 30 s and 2 min of RM on forearm muscle oxygenation, parameters associated with oxidative metabolism, and microvascular reactivity as well as brachial artery endothelial function. Forearm skeletal muscle parameters were assessed in 12 healthy young men (26 ± 6 yrs) using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined with a 5-min vascular occlusion test. Additionally, brachial artery endothelial function was simultaneously assessed by measuring the relative change in brachial artery diameter normalized to the hyperemic blood flow (Normalized %FMD). These measurements were performed before and after the RM interventions performed on the anterior forearm muscles. Forearm muscle oxygenation increased after 30 s of RM (62 ± 7 to 71 ± 11%; p = 0.02) while there was no change from baseline to post-intervention after 2 min of RM. No change was observed for oxidative metabolism, however, the significant main effect (p = 0.02) for NIRS-derived reperfusion slope (%{\textperiodcentered}s−1) indicated that microvascular function improved after both 30 s (2.30 ± 0.5 to 2.61 ± 0.70%{\textperiodcentered}s−1) and 2 min of RM (2.33 ± 0.4 to 2.60 ± 0.85%{\textperiodcentered}s−1). The lack of significant effects of RM on Normalized %FMD suggest that the RM did not acutely improve brachial artery endothelial function. These findings provide, for the first time, evidence that RM improves skeletal muscle oxygenation and parameters associated with microvascular reactivity. Additionally, RM increased brachial artery blood flow, but not upstream brachial artery endothelial function.},

abstract = {Introduction: Visuo-spatial working memory (VSWM) performances undergo a decline throughout aging and are affected by the space in which the task is performed (reaching or navigational). Cerebral oxygenation and cognitive capabilities could explain this decline. We assessed the effects of age on cerebral oxygenation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in VSWM tasks in reaching and navigational space. We also assessed cognitive correlates of VSWM performance in each space. Method: Thirty-one (31) young adults (YA) and 24 healthy older adults (OA) performed a battery of neuropsychological tests and the electronic Corsi Block-tapping Test in reaching space (e-CBT) and in navigational space on the “Virtual Carpet” (VWCT). Participants were asked to memorize and recall a sequential pathway, progressively increasing from 2 to 9 blocks. Their span score reflected VSWM performance. The dlPFC oxygenation (oxyhaemoglobin: $\Delta$O2Hb and deoxyhaemoglobin: $\Delta$HHb) was measured by using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) during the encoding of the sequential pathway in both tasks. Results: YA had higher span scores than OA in both spaces. We identified a significantly stronger decrease of $\Delta$HHb in YA compared to OA during encoding in VWCT. OA also exhibited significantly lower cerebral oxygenation in VWCT compared to e-CBT. A decrease of $\Delta$HHb was also associated with a better performance in VWCT. Finally, we identified the association of mental rotation and executive functions with VSWM performance in both tasks. Conclusion: VSWM performance and cerebral oxygenation during encoding are impacted by aging. Space in which the task was performed was found to be associated with different cognitive functions and revealed differences in cerebral oxygenation.},

abstract = {Purpose: Exercise training improves endothelium-dependent vasodilation, whereas hypoxic stress causes vascular endothelial dysfunction. Monocyte-derived endothelial progenitor cells (Mon-EPCs) contribute to vascular repair process by differentiating into endothelial cells. This study investigates how high-intensity interval (HIT) and moderate-intensity continuous (MCT) exercise training affect circulating Mon-EPC levels and EPC functionality under hypoxic condition. Methods: Sixty healthy sedentary males were randomized to engage in either HIT (3-min intervals at 40 and 80 % VO2max for five repetitions, n = 20) or MCT (sustained 60 % VO2max, n = 20) for 30 min/day, 5 days/week for 6 weeks, or to a control group (CTL) that did not received exercise intervention (n = 20). Mon-EPC characteristics and EPC functionality under hypoxic exercise (HE, 100 W under 12 % O2) were determined before and after HIT, MCT, and CTL. Results: The results demonstrated that after the intervention, the HIT group exhibited larger improvements in VO2peak, estimated peak cardiac output (QC), and estimated peak perfusions of frontal cerebral lobe (QFC) and vastus lateralis (QVL) than the MCT group. Furthermore, HIT (a) increased circulating CD14++/CD16−/CD34+/KDR+ (Mon-1 EPC) and CD14++/CD16+/CD34+/KDR+ (Mon-2 EPC) cell counts, (b) promoted the migration and tube formation of EPCs, (c) diminished the shedding of endothelial (CD34−/KDR+/phosphatidylserine+) cells, and (d) elevated plasma nitrite plus nitrate, stromal cell-derived factor-1, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and vascular endothelial growth factor-A concentrations at rest or following HE, compared to those of MCT. In addition, Mon-1 and -2 EPC counts were directly related to VO2peak and estimated peak QC, QFC, and QVL. Conclusions: HIT is superior to MCT for improving hemodynamic adaptation and Mon-EPC production. Moreover, HIT effectively enhances EPC functionality and suppresses endothelial injury undergoing hypoxia.},

Behavioral studies show that people sometimes imitate irrational actions, a phenomenon called overimitation. However, limitations on movement in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) mean that the neural basis of overimitation has not been studied. To address this, our study employed a less restrictive neuroimaging technique, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Measurements were taken while participants observed either rational or irrational movements before performing movements on a computerized puzzle task. Observing irrational actions produced greater activation in right anterior inferior parietal lobule (aIPL), replicating results from the fMRI literature. This is a proof of principle that fNIRS can be used as an alternative to fMRI in social cognition experiments, and that parietal cortex has a core role in responding to irrational actions.},

abstract = {Objective: The effects of a training program (TP) on muscle microvascularization during exercise remained to be explored in adolescents with obesity. We hypothesized that a TP would lead to better microvascular adaptations to exercise in skeletal muscle. Methods: 15 inactive adolescents followed a 12-week TP where both peripheral (muscular microvascularization) and central (cardiac) adaptations to exercise (40 min exercise set at 70% VO2peak) were assessed before and after intervention. Microvascular adaptations were evaluated in the Musculus vastus lateralis with near-infrared spectroscopy, by measurement of muscular blood volume (IR-BV) and tissue oxygen saturation (IR-SO2). Central adaptations were evaluated using thoracic impedance. Results: The TP favored lower BMI (p < 0.001), lower total and abdominal fat (p < 0.001), and a trend for the decrease in insulin resistance index (p = 0.07). VO2peak relative to weight (p = 0.008) and maximum power output increased (p = 0.0003). A smaller initial drop in IR-BV and IR-SO2 (p < 0.001), a prompter return of these parameters to their base values, and a higher IR-BV and IR-SO2 all times taken together (p < 0.001) were observed after completing the TP. Concerning central adaptation, cardiac output decreased (p < 0.001). Conclusion: We demonstrate for the first time by noninvasive techniques that a training program induces peripheral and central vascular adaptations to exercise in adolescents with obesity.},

abstract = {Conventional near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), introduced by Jobsis in 1977, can be considered as a reliable trend monitor for cerebral oxygenation. Quantisation, however, is complex and cumbersome. Recently a relatively simple system for cerebral oximetry (INVOS 3100, Somanetics Corporation, USA) was developed, measuring the regional oxygen saturation (rSo2) in the capillary bed of the cerebrum, presented as a numerical figure for easy interpretation. In this study a comparison was made between a conventional NIRS instrument and the new INVOS instrument, in order to obtain information about sensitivity and usefulness of the INVOS system. Changes in cerebral haemodynamics were induced by a moderate decrease of the arterial oxygen saturation (Sao2) and by varying the arterial carbon dioxide level (PaCO2). This will result in a higher (hypercapnia) or lower (hypocapnia) cerebral blood flow and subsequent change of both NIRS signals and INVOS signal. Healthy volunteers were used for this study. It was found that the steady state value for rSo2 was 70 ± 6% (mean ± SD). During the lowering of arterial saturation a poor correlation was found between rSo2 and Sa02 (r=0. 47). Increased cerebral blood flow induced by hypercapnia was detected by both conventional NIRS and the INVOS. Decreased cerebral blood flow induced by hypocapnia could only be detected by conventional NIRS. It was concluded that due to the variation in displayed rSo2 and the high amount of averaging in the algorithm the INVOS instrument does not yet provide more information than conventional NIRS.

abstract = {PurposeJoint angle is a significant determinant of neuromuscular and metabolic function. We tested the hypothesis that previously reported correlations between knee-extensor torque complexity and metabolic rate ( ṁVO2 ) would be conserved at reduced joint angles (i.e. shorter muscle lengths).MethodsEleven participants performed intermittent isometric knee-extensor contractions at 50% maximum voluntary torque for 30 min or until task failure (whichever occurred sooner) at joint angles of 30{\textordmasculine}, 60{\textordmasculine} and 90{\textordmasculine} of flexion (0{\textordmasculine} = extension). Torque and surface EMG were sampled continuously. Complexity and fractal scaling of torque were quantified using approxi-mate entropy (ApEn) and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) $\alpha$. ṁVO2 was determined using near-infrared spectroscopy.Results Time to task failure/end increased as joint angle decreased (P < 0.001). Over time, complexity decreased at 90{\textordmasculine} and 60{\textordmasculine} (decreased ApEn, increased DFA $\alpha$, both P < 0.001), but not 30{\textordmasculine}. ṁVO2 increased at all joint angles (P < 0.001), though the magnitude of this increase was lower at 30{\textordmasculine} compared to 60{\textordmasculine} and 90{\textordmasculine} (both P < 0.01). There were significant correlations between torque complexity and ṁVO2 at 90{\textordmasculine} (ApEn, r = − 0.60, P = 0.049) and 60{\textordmasculine} (ApEn, r = − 0.64, P = 0.035; DFA $\alpha$, $\rho$ = 0.68, P = 0.015).ConclusionThe lack of correlation between ṁVO2 and complexity at 30{\textordmasculine} was likely due to low relative task demands, given the similar kinetics of ṁVO2 and torque complexity. An inverse correlation between ṁVO2 and knee-extensor torque com-plexity occurs during high-intensity contractions at intermediate, but not short, muscle lengths.},

In a randomized crossover design, nine collegiate basketball players performed IRL (15 cmH2O) or passive recovery (CON) at 5-min rest intervals during and immediately after 6 sets of a 30-s SIE test. Performance, muscular oxygenation of vastus lateralis, blood lactate and pH were measured at each condition. Blood lactate at 5-min (−20.5 %) and 20-min (−21.3 %) after SIE were significantly lower in IRL than in CON. The pH at 5-min after SIE was significantly higher in IRL than in CON (+0.8 %, p < 0.05). However, the total work in IRL was significantly lower than in CON (−2.7 %, p < 0.05). Average changes in total hemoglobin at rest intervals in IRL were significantly lower than in CON (−34.5 %, p < 0.05). The IRL could attenuate exercise-induced metabolic acidosis; however, the decreased blood flow at rest intervals might increase the physical challenge in SIE.},

abstract = {Spontaneous slow oscillations occur in cerebral hemodynamics and blood pressure (BP), and may reflect neurogenic, metabolic or myogenic control of the cerebral vasculature. Aging is accompanied by a degeneration of the vascular system, which may have consequences for regional cerebral blood flow and cognitive performance. This degeneration may be reflected in a reduction of spontaneous slow oscillations of cerebral hemodynamics and BP. Therefore, we aimed to establish the dependency of slow oscillations of cerebral hemodynamics and BP on the factors age and cognitive load, by using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Fourteen healthy young (23-32. years) and 14 healthy older adults (64-78. years) performed a verbal n-back working-memory task. Oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin concentration changes were registered by two fNIRS channels located over left and right prefrontal cortex. BP was measured in the finger by photoplethysmography. We found that very-low-frequency oscillations (0.02-0.07. Hz) and low-frequency oscillations (0.07-0.2. Hz) of cerebral hemodynamics and BP were reduced in the older adults compared to the young during task performance. In young adults, very-low-frequency oscillations of cerebral hemodynamics and BP reduced with increased cognitive load. Cognitive load did not affect low-frequency oscillations of the cerebral hemodynamics and BP. Transfer function analysis indicated that the relationship between BP and cerebral hemodynamic oscillations does not change under influence of age and cognitive load. Our results suggest aging-related changes in the microvasculature such as declined spontaneous activity in microvascular smooth muscle cells and vessel stiffness. Moreover, our results indicate that in addition to local vasoregulatory processes, systemic processes also influence cerebral hemodynamic signals. It is therefore crucial to take the factors age and BP into consideration for the analysis and interpretation of hemodynamic neuroimaging data. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Endurance cyclists have a substantial risk to develop flow limitations in the iliac arteries during their career. These flow limitations are due to extreme hemodynamic stress which may result in functional arterial kinking and/or intravascular lesions. Early diagnosis may improve outcome and could prevent the necessity for surgical vascular repair. However, current diagnostic techniques have unsatisfactory sensitivity and cannot be applied during exercise. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has shown great diagnostic potential in peripheral vascular disease and might bring a solution since it measures tissue oxygenation in real time during and after exercise. This report describes the first experiences of the application of NIRS in the vastus lateralis muscle during and after maximal graded cycling exercise in ten healthy participants and in three patients with flow limitations due to (1) subtle functional kinking, (2) an intravascular lesion, and (3) severe functional kinking. The results are put into perspective based on an empirically fitted model. Delayed recovery, showing clearly different types of patterns of tissue reoxygenation after exercise, was found in the affected athletes compared with the healthy participants. In the patients that had kinking of the arteries, tissue reoxygenation was clearly more delayed if NIRS was measured in provocative position with flexed hip. In this pilot experiment, clearly distinctive reoxygenation patterns are observed during recovery consistent with severity of flow limitation, indicating that NIRS is a promising diagnostic tool to detect and grade arterial flow limitations in athletes. Our findings may guide research and optimization of NIRS for future clinical application.},

abstract = {Background and aim: Disturbances in cerebral oxygenation saturation (SO2) have been linked to adverse outcome in adults, children, and neonates. In intensive care, the cerebral SO2 is increasingly being monitored by Near-InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS). Unfortunately NIRS has a limited penetration depth. The "modified T2-prepared Blood Imaging of Oxygen Saturation" (T2-BIOS) MR sequence provides a step towards full brain SO2 measurement. Materials and methods: Tissue SO2, and venous SO2 (SvO2) were obtained simultaneously by T2-BIOS during a respiratory challenge in ten healthy volunteers. These two measures were compared to SO2 that was obtained by a single probe MR-compatible NIRS setup, and to cerebral blood flow and venous SO2 that were obtained by arterial spin labelling and T2-TRIR, respectively. Results: SO2-T2-BIOS and SO2-NIRS had a mean bias of -4.0% (95% CI -21.3% to 13.3%). SvO2-T2-BIOS correlated with SO2-NIRS (R2 = 0.41, p = 0.002) and SvO2-T2-TRIR (R2 = 0.87, p = 0.002). In addition, SO2-NIRS correlated with SvO2-T2-TRIR (R2 = 0.85, p = 0.003) Frontal cerebral blood flow correlated with SO2-T2-BIOS (R2 = 0.21, p = 0.04), but was not significant in relation to SO2-NIRS. Discussion/conclusion: Full brain SO2 assessment by any technique may help validating NIRS and may prove useful in guiding the clinical management of patient populations with cerebral injury following hypoxic-ischaemic events. The agreement between NIRS and T2-BIOS provides confidence in measuring cerebral SO2 by either technique. As it stands now, the T2-BIOS represents a novel idea and future work will focus on improvements to make it a reliable tool for SO2 assessment.},

abstract = {Background : Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has recognized potential but limited application for non-invasive diagnostic evaluation. Data analysis methodology that reproducibly distinguishes between the presence or absence of physiologic abnormality could broaden clinical application of this optical technique. Methods : Sample data sets from simultaneous NIRS bladder monitoring and invasive urodynamic pressure-flow studies (UDS) are used to illustrate how a diagnostic algorithm is constructed using classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. Misclassification errors of CART and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) are computed and examples of other urological NIRS data likely amenable to CART analysis presented. Results : CART generated a clinically relevant classification algorithm (error 4%) using 46 data sets of changes in chromophore concentration composed of the whole time series without specifying features. LDA did not (error 16%). Using CART NIRS data provided comparable discriminant ability to the UDS diagnostic nomogram for the presence or absence of obstructive pathology (88% specificity, 84% precision). Pilot data examples from children with and without voiding dysfunction and women with mild or severe pelvic floor muscle dysfunction also show potentially diagnostic differences in chromophore concentration. Conclusions : CART analysis can likely be applied in other NIRS monitoring applications intended to classify patients into those with and without pathology. },

This study aimed to assess the effects of inspiratory loading (IL) on intercostal muscles (IM), vastus lateralis (VL) and cerebral (Cox) muscles oxygenation in women soccer players during high-intensity dynamic exercise. Ten female soccer players were randomized to perform in order two constant-load tests on a treadmill until the exhaustion time (Tlim) (100 % of maximal oxygen uptake- V˙O2). They breathed freely or against a fixed inspiratory loading (IL) of 41 cm H2O (∼30 % of maximal inspiratory pressure). Oxygenated ($\Delta$[OxyHb]), deoxygenated ($\Delta$[DeoxyHb]), total hemoglobin ($\Delta$[tHb]) and tissue saturation index ($\Delta$TSI) were obtained by NIRs. Also, blood lactate [La—] was obtained. IL significantly reduced Tlim (224 ± 54 vs 78 ± 20; P < 0.05) and increased [La—], V˙O2, respiratory cycles and dyspnea when corrected to Tlim (P < 0.05). IL also resulted in decrease of $\Delta$[OxyHb] of Cox and IM during exercise compared with rest condition. In addition, decrease of $\Delta$[OxyHb] was observed on IM during exercise when contrasted with Sham (P < 0.05). Furthermore, significant higher $\Delta$[DeoxyHb] of IM and significant lower $\Delta$[DeoxyHb] of Cox were observed when IL was applied during exercise in contrast with Sham (P < 0.05). These results were accompanied with significant reduction of $\Delta$[tHb] and $\Delta$TSI of IM and VL when IL was applied (P < 0.05). High-intensity exercise with IL decreased respiratory and peripheral muscle oxygenation with negative impact on exercise performance. However, the increase in ventilatory work did not impact cerebral oxygenation in soccer players.},

abstract = {Purpose: High intensity interval training (HIIT) has been proposed as a time-efficient format of exercise to reduce the chronic disease burden associated with sedentary behaviour. Changes in oxygen utilisation at the local tissue level during an acute session of HIIT could be the primary stimulus for the health benefits associated with this format of exercise. The recovery periods of HIIT effect the physiological responses that occur during the session. It was hypothesised that in sedentary individuals, local and systemic oxygen utilisation would be higher during HIIT interspersed with active recovery periods, when compared to passive recovery periods. Methods: Twelve sedentary males (mean ± SD; age 23 ± 3 yr) completed three conditions on a cycle ergometer: 1) HIIT with passive recovery periods between four bouts (HIITPASS) 2) HIIT with active recovery periods between four bouts (HIITACT) 3) HIITACT with four HIIT bouts replaced with passive periods (REC). Deoxygenated haemoglobin (HHb) in the vastus lateralis (VL) and gastrocnemius (GN) muscles and the pre-frontal cortex (FH), oxygen consumption (VO2), power output and heart rate (HR) were measured continuously during the three conditions. Results: There was a significant increase in HHb at VL during bouts 2 (p = 0.017), 3 (p = 0.035) and 4 (p = 0.035) in HIITACT, compared to HIITPASS. Mean power output was significantly lower in HIITACT, compared to HIITPASS (p < 0.001). There was a significant main effect for site in both HIITPASS (p = 0.029) and HIITACT (p = 0.005). There were no significant differences in VO2 and HR between HIITPASS and HIITACT. Conclusions: The increase in HHb at VL and the lower mean power output during HIITACT could indicate that a higher level of deoxygenation contributes to decreased mechanical power in sedentary participants. The significant differences in HHb between sites indicates the specificity of oxygen utilisation.},

The purposes of this study were (i) to trial the use of uNIRS, in a real world training study, and (ii) to monitor the effects of a swim training program upon muscle oxygenation status in short distance swimming. A total of 14 junior club level swimmers completed a repeated swim sprint test before and after an eight week endurance training program. A waterproof, portable Near-Infrared Spectroscopy device was attached to the vastus lateralis. uNIRS successfully measured changes in muscle oxygenation and blood volume in all individuals; rapid sub-second time resolution of the device was able to demonstrate muscle oxygenation changes during the characteristic swim movements. Post training heart rate recovery and swim performance time were significantly improved. uNIRS data also showed significant changes. A larger rise in deoxyhemoglobin during individual sprints suggested training induced an increase in muscle oxygen extraction; a faster recovery time for muscle oxygenation suggested positive training induced changes and significant changes in muscle blood flow also occur. As a strong correlation was seen between an increased reoxygenation rate and an improved swim performance time, these findings support the use of uNIRS as a new performance analysis tool in swimming.},

However, the reproducibility and validity of the methodology has not been defined. This studyevaluated the reproducibility and validity of twitch electrical stimulation and accelerometer-based mechanomyography (aMMG) as an assessment of muscle endurance. Participants were healthy males and females 21.8±1.9 years of age. Muscle twitch acceleration was measured using an accelerometer placed over the surface of the muscle. The relationship between acceleration and torque was measured during twitch stimulation of the vastus lateralis muscle. Muscle endurance of the forearm and gastrocnemius was measured during 9 minutes of twitch electrical stimulation, in three stages (3min/stage) of increasing frequency (2Hz, 4Hz, and 6Hz). An Endurance Index (EI) was calculated as the percent of acceleration at the end of each stimulation stage relative to the peak acceleration. Oxygen saturation was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy. Results showed that acceleration correlated with torque during twitch electrical stimulation of the vastus lateralis (mean R2= 0.96±0.04; p<0.05). Measures of forearm EI reproducibility were CV= 2.5-7.4%. EI was significantly higher (12.1%) in the gastrocnemius compared to the forearm (p<0.01). Muscle oxygen saturation was not reduced during stimulation of the forearm (72.6±9.8% at 2Hz, 73.2±11.6% at 4Hz, and 71.0±12.5% at 6Hz) compared to resting baseline (74.3±15.1%) (p>0.1). This study found that EI is a reproducible measure of muscle endurance that is not influenced by declines in oxygen saturation.},

abstract = {Background: Sufficient O2 supply to the brain is necessary for adequate cerebral energy metabolism, function and growth. Objectives: To elucidate the relation between changes in cerebral arterial O2 content and cerebral O2 supply and changes in the oxygenation state of cerebral hemoglobin, and to determine whether concentration changes in oxyhemoglobin ($\Delta$cO2Hb), deoxyhemoglobin ($\Delta$cHHb), and cerebral arterial oxygenation ($\Delta$cHbD; the difference between $\Delta$cO2Hb and $\Delta$cHHb), and cerebral blood volume ($\Delta$CBV) can be used to assess the decline in brain cell function during hypoxemia in lambs born near term. Methods: 17 preterm lambs were delivered at a mean gestational age of 133 days. Decreases in cerebral arterial oxygen content were induced by a stepwise reduction in inspired oxygen concentration. Mean values of all continuous variables were calculated over the last 180 s of each hypoxemic level. Cerebral arterial blood gases were analyzed at the end of each level to calculate cerebral arterial O2 content and cerebral O2 supply. Results: Changes in cerebral arterial O2 content and cerebral O2 supply were positively linearly related with $\Delta$cO 2Hb and $\Delta$cHbD, and negatively with $\Delta$cHHb and the concentration changes in total hemoglobin. Electrocortical brain activity remained stable until the cO2Hb and cHbD decreased to >3.0 ± 0.9and >8.1 ± 1.9 (mean ± SD) $\mu$mol/100 g, respectively, and cHHb and CBV increased to >4.3 ± 1.7 and 1.37 ± 0.48 ml/100 g, respectively, as compared to baseline. Conclusions: Changes in cerebral arterial O2 content and cerebral O2 supply are adequately reflected by changes in the oxygenation state of cerebral hemoglobin. Concentration changes in $\Delta$cO2Hb, $\Delta$cHHb, $\Delta$cHbD and $\Delta$CBV can be used to assess the decline in brain cell function during hypoxemia in lambs born near term.

abstract = {This study tested the hypothesis that a novel, gravity-induced blood flow restricted (BFR) aerobic exercise (AE) model will result in greater activation of the AMPK–PGC-1$\alpha$ pathway compared with work rate-matched non-BFR. Thirteen healthy males (age: 22.4 ± 3.0 years; peak oxygen uptake: 42.4 ± 7.3 mL/(kg{\textperiodcentered}min)) completed two 30-min work rate-matched bouts of cycling performed with their legs below (CTL) and above their heart (BFR) at $\alpha$2 weeks apart. Muscle biopsies were taken before, immediately, and 3 h after exercise. Blood was drawn before and immediately after exercise. Our novel gravity-induced BFR model led to less muscle oxygenation during BFR compared with CTL (O2Hb: P = 0.01; HHb: P < 0.01) and no difference in muscle activation (p = 0.53). Plasma epinephrine increased following both BFR and CTL (p < 0.01); however, only norepinephrine increased more following BFR (p < 0.01). PGC-1$\alpha$ messenger RNA (mRNA) increased more following BFR ($\alpha$6-fold) compared with CTL ($\alpha$4-fold; p = 0.036). VEGFA mRNA increased (p < 0.01) similarly following BFR and CTL (p = 0.21), and HIF-1$\alpha$ mRNA did not increase following either condition (p = 0.21). Phosphorylated acetyl-coenzymeAcarboxylase (ACC) increased more following BFR (p<0.035) whereas p-PKA substrates, p-p38 MAPK, and acetyl-p53 increased (p < 0.05) similarly following both conditions (p > 0.05). In conclusion, gravity-induced BFR is a viable BFR model that demonstrated an important role of AMPK signalling on augmenting PGC-1$\alpha$ mRNA. Novelty • Gravity-induced BFR AE reduced muscle oxygenation without impacting muscle activation, advancing gravity-induced BFR as a simple, inexpensive BFR model. • Gravity-induced BFR increased PGC-1$\alpha$ mRNA and ACC phosphorylation more than work rate-matched non-BFR AE. • This is the first BFR AE study to concurrently measure blood catecholamines, muscle activation, and muscle oxygenation.},

abstract = {Background: Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) is often used for correction of metabolic acidosis in preterm infants. The effects of NaHCO 3 administration on cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation are not well known. Furthermore, there is no consensus on infusion rate of NaHCO 3. Objectives: To evaluate the effects of rapid versus slow infusion of NaHCO3 on cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation in preterm infants. Methods: Twenty-nine preterm infants with metabolic acidosis were randomized into two groups (values are mean ± SD): In group A (GA 30.5 ± 1.7 weeks, b.w. 1,254 ± 425 g) NaHCO3 4.2% was injected as a bolus. In group B (GA 30.3 ± 1.8 weeks, b.w. 1,179 ± 318g) NaHCO3 4.2% was administered over a 30-min period. Concentration changes of oxyhemoglobin (cO2Hb) and deoxyhemoglobin (cHHb) were assessed using near infrared spectrophotometry. Changes in HbD (= cO2Hb - cHHb) represent changes in cerebral blood oxygenation and changes in ctHb (= cO2Hb + cHHb) reflect changes in cerebral blood volume. Cerebral blood flow velocity was intermittently measured using Doppler ultrasound. Longitudinal data analysis was performed using linear mixed models (SAS procedure MIXED), to account for the fact that the repeated observations in each individual were correlated. Results: Administration of NaHCO3 resulted in an increase of cerebral blood volume which was more evident if NaHCO3 was injected rapidly than when infused slowly. HbD and cerebral blood flow velocity did not show significant changes in either group. Conclusion: To minimize fluctuations in cerebral hemodynamics, slow infusion of sodium bicarbonate is preferable to rapid injection. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2006 S. Karger AG.},

abstract = {Due to the value of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), adulteration has become an important issue in the industry, which has created demand for quick and inexpensive fraud detection testing. In contrast to many current food fraud detection methods, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can be inexpensive and convenient by minimizing sample preparation and measurement times. In this study, we developed a method using NIRS and chemometrics to detect adulteration of EVOO with other edible oil types that does not require sample preparation and can be completed in less than 10 min. First, a single EVOO was adulterated with corn oil from 2.7% to 25% w/w. Spectra for the unadulterated sample and its adulterated counterparts were measured. A principal component analysis (PCA) scores plot showed separation between the adulterated mixtures and the unadulterated sample, which demonstrated that the developed method could detect as low as 2.7% w/w adulteration if an unadulterated sample of the oil in question is provided. To study adulteration detection without an unadulterated sample for reference, the spectra of unadulterated samples and samples adulterated with corn, sunflower, soybean, and canola oils were measured. A PCA with soft independent modelling of class analogy was used for adulteration detection. Lower limits of adulteration detection for corn, sunflower, soybean, and canola oils were found to be approximately 20%, 20%, 15%, and 10%, respectively. These results demonstrate that the developed method can be used to rapidly screen for adulterated olive oils.},

abstract = {Conventionally, diagnosis of lower urinary tract infection (LUTI) is made on the basis of history, urine microscopy and culture. But there are limitations to this methodology especially in children and special populations where there is difficulty in obtaining a full history and details of clinical symptoms. The aim of this study was to determine if monitoring bladder wall oxygenation as a measure of bladder mucosal inflammation using transcutaneous near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) allows detection of the presence or absence of LUTI in children. Materials and methods A convenience sample of children referred to a pediatric urology clinic with an acute LUTI and a control group were studied. Diagnosis was confirmed by history, physical examination, laboratory investigations, and urine culture. Participants had transcutaneous measurement of an absolute measure of tissue oxygen saturation (TSI%) in their bladder wall, and a quadriceps muscle control site, using a spatially resolved (SR) wireless NIRS device. Average measures of bladder wall TSI% (B.TSI%) and quadriceps TSI% (Q.TSI%) and their differences (TSI.diff) were calculated and compared between those with LUTI and controls by performing a two-way repeated analysis of variance. Results Thirty-four patients met the inclusion criteria (LUTI n = 12 and controls n = 22). Comparing LUTI to controls B.TSI% and TSI.diff values were significantly higher in the LUTI group (p < 0.0001), while Q.TSI% values were not significantly different. Conclusions Optical monitoring of bladder wall oxygenation is feasible in children. In this study a significant difference was evident in a SR NIRS-derived measure of absolute oxygen saturation in the bladder wall between children with UTI diagnosed by conventional testing methods, and those in a control group without infection. SR-NIRS monitoring of bladder wall oxygenation may offer a rapid and non-invasive means of bedside screening for LUTI where history and/or clinical signs are not available or adequate.},

abstract = {This study investigated aerobic metabolism responses in trunk muscles during a prolonged trunk extension exercise in athletes and untrained young men. The aim was to analyze the adaptations induced by 2 types of sports: one involving intensive use of trunk muscles (i. e., judo), and one known to induce high aerobic capacity in the whole body (i. e., cycling). Eleven judokas, 10 cyclists and 9 healthy untrained young men performed trunk extension exercises on an isokinetic dynamometer. During the first session, muscle strength was assessed during maximal trunk extension. During a second session, a 5-min exercise was performed to investigate aerobic responses with regard to trunk muscles. The near infrared spectroscopy technique and a gas exchange analyzer were used continuously to evaluate mechanical efficiency, VO 2 on-set kinetics, trunk muscle deoxygenation and blood volume. Judokas showed greater trunk strength and mechanical efficiency (p<0.05). Cyclists presented faster VO 2 on-set kinetics (p<0.05) and greater muscle deoxygenation and blood volume compared to untrained men (p<0.001). These results suggest that practicing judo improves trunk extension efficiency whereas cycling accelerates aerobic pathways and enhances microvascular responses to trunk extension exercise. Sport practice improves aerobic metabolism responses in trunk extensor muscles differently, according to the training specificities.},

abstract = {Executive function and motor control deficits adversely affect gait performance with age, but the neural correlates underlying this interaction during stair climbing remains unclear. Twenty older adults (72.7 ± 6.9 years) completed single tasks: standing and responding to a response time task (SC), ascending or descending stairs (SMup, SMdown); and a dual-task: responding while ascending or descending stairs (DTup, DTdown). Prefrontal hemodynamic response changes (∆HbO2, ∆HbR) were examined using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), gait speed was measured using in-shoe smart insoles, and vocal response time and accuracy were recorded. Findings revealed increased ∆HbO2 (p = 0.020) and slower response times (p < 0.001) during dual-versus single tasks. ∆HbR (p = 0.549), accuracy (p = 0.135) and gait speed (p = 0.475) were not significantly different between tasks or stair climbing conditions. ∆HbO2 and response time findings suggest that executive processes are less efficient during dual-tasks. These findings, in addition to gait speed and accuracy maintenance, may provide insights into the neural changes that precede performance declines. To capture the subtle differences between stair ascent and descent and extend our understanding of the neural correlates of stair climbing in older adults, future studies should examine more difficult cognitive tasks.},

abstract = {PurposeJoint angle is a significant determinant of neuromuscular and metabolic function. We tested the hypothesis that previously reported correlations between knee-extensor torque complexity and metabolic rate ( ṁVO2 ) would be conserved at reduced joint angles (i.e. shorter muscle lengths).Methods Eleven participants performed intermittent isometric knee-extensor contractions at 50% maximum voluntary torque for 30 min or until task failure (whichever occurred sooner) at joint angles of 30{\textordmasculine}, 60{\textordmasculine} and 90{\textordmasculine} of flexion (0{\textordmasculine} = extension). Torque and surface EMG were sampled continuously. Complexity and fractal scaling of torque were quantified using approximate entropy (ApEn) and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) $\alpha$. ṁVO2 was determined using near-infrared spectroscopy. Results  Time to task failure/end increased as joint angle decreased (P <   0.001). Over time, complexity decreased at 90{\textordmasculine} and 60{\textordmasculine} (decreased ApEn, increased DFA $\alpha$, both P <   0.001), but not 30{\textordmasculine}. ṁVO2 increased at all joint angles (P < 0.001),  though the magnitude of this increase was lower at 30{\textordmasculine} compared to 60{\textordmasculine} and 90{\textordmasculine} (both P < 0.01). There were significant correlations between torque complexity and ṁVO2 at 90{\textordmasculine} (ApEn, r =  − 0.60, P =   0.049) and 60{\textordmasculine} (ApEn, r =  − 0.64, P = 0.035;  DFA $\alpha$, $\rho$ = 0.68, P = 0.015).Conclusion The lack of correlation between ṁVO2 and complexity at 30{\textordmasculine} was likely due to low relative task demands, given the similar kinetics of ṁVO2 and torque complexity. An inverse correlation between ṁVO2 and knee-extensor torque complexity occurs during high-intensity contractions at intermediate, but not short, muscle lengths},

abstract = {Objective: We investigated the respiratory and vastus lateralis oxygenation responses to exhaustive, constant-load cycling at two exercise intensities.
Methods: Eight moderately-trained male randomly cycled to exhaustion at 75% and 85% of maximal work-load (CL75 and CL85, respectively) measured during a maximal incremental test. From continuous recordings of respiratory variables and near-infrared spectroscopy signals of the vastus lateralis muscle, VO2 slow component (SC) and deoxyhemoglobin (HHb) SC were calculated.
Results: At exhaustion, VO2 (+19 ± 25%), VO2 SC (+59 ± 24%) and minute ventilation (+14 ± 14%) were significantly higher during CL85 vs. CL75, whereas oxyhemoglobin (-67 ± 22%) and total hemoglobin (-36 ± 3%) responses were lower (all p<0.05). Additionally, VO2 SC during CL75 and CL85 were strongly correlated (r=0.88, p<0.001). The HHb SC did not differ between CL75 and CL85 (3.10 ± 0.75 vs. 3.44 ± 1.1 A.U, respectively; p=0.60). HHb SC and VO2 SC during CL85 (r=0.94, p<0.001), but not during CL75 (r=-0.08, p=0.90), were correlated. Finally, HHb SC during CL75 and CL85 were unrelated (r=-0.20, p=0.70).
Conclusion: Our results highlight that only the contribution of locomotor muscles to the VO2 SC magnitude is affected by the exercise intensity and not that of ventilation.},

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the reproducibility of orthostatic responses of cerebral cortical oxygenation and systemic haemodynamics in elderly subjects. In 27 healthy elderly subjects (age 70-84 years), changes in systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), heart rate (HR) and stroke volume (SV) were continuously monitored by Finapres (Finger Arterial Pressure), and changes in oxyhaemoglobin ([O2Hb]) and deoxyhaemoglobin ([HHb]) concentrations were continuously measured over the right frontal cortex by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during supine rest and 10 min of active standing on two separate occasions. SBP and DBP increased by 6.7 ± 15.4 mmHg (P<0.05, mean ± SD) and 8.2 ± 6.4 mmHg (P<0.01), respectively, whereas HR increased by 9.5 ± 5.0 bpm (P<0.01) and SV decreased by -8.3 ± 7.4 ml (P<0.01) during standing on the first occasion. [O2Hb] decreased by -3.9 ± 2.9 $\mu$mol 1-1 (P<0.01), while [HHb] increased by 1.8 ± 2.2 $\mu$mol 1-1 (P<0.01). Group-averaged orthostatic changes in cortical oxygenation and systemic haemodynamics were very similar on the two occasions, although an intraindividual variation was found. Cortical oxygenation changes were not accompanied by severe cerebral symptoms. Active standing induced reproducible group-averaged frontal cortical oxygenation declines in healthy elderly subjects, although an intraindividual day-to-day variability was present, possibly related to the variability of orthostatic BP responses. These findings indicate that cerebral autoregulation fails to compensate completely for postural changes in elderly subjects, which might predispose elderly subjects to ischaemic cerebral symptoms.},

Nine endurance athletes performed two 5-km cycling time trials (TT) interspersed by 45 minutes of recovery that included either IPC, active recovery (AR) or neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) in a randomized crossover design. Performance, blood markers, arterial O2 saturation (SpO2), heart rate (HR), near-infrared spectroscopy-derived muscle oxygenation parameters and perceptual measures were recorded throughout TTs and re-covery. Differences were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVAs and Cohen's effect size (ES). The decrement in chron-ometric performance from TT1 to TT2 was similar between recovery modalities (IPC:-6.1 sec, AR:-7.9 sec, NMES:-5.4 sec, p = 0.84, ES 0.05). The modalities induced similar increases in blood volume before the start of TT2 (IPC: 13.3%, AR: 14.6%, NMES: 15.0%, p = 0.79, ES 0.06) and similar changes in lactate concentration and pH. There were negligible differences between conditions in bicarbonate concentration, base excess of blood and total concentration of carbon dioxide, and no difference in SpO2, HR and muscle O2 extraction during exercise (all p > 0.05). We interpreted these findings to suggest that IPC is as effective as AR and NMES to enhance muscle blood volume, metabolic by-prod-ucts clearance and maximal endurance performance. IPC could therefore complement the athlete's toolbox to promote recovery.},

abstract = {Background
Individuals with coronary heart disease (CHD) exhibit cognitive deficits and cerebrovascular dysfunctions, and are at higher risk of developing dementia. Cognitive function in individuals with CHD has never been studied during acute aerobic exercise. Given the increasing popularity of training at high peak power output (PPO), its impact on cerebrovascular and cognitive functions in individuals with CHD should be further studied.

Method
Thirty-eight individuals with CHD and 16 healthy controls completed two exercise bouts at 30% and 70% of their individualized PPO on an ergocycle while performing a cognitive task including non-executive and executive conditions. Variations of oxy- deoxy-hemoglobin, and total hemoglobin concentrations were measured on left prefrontal cortex at both PPO using near-infrared spectroscopy.

Results
Cognitive task performances were equivalent between groups at all intensity levels. Individuals with CHD exhibited larger variation of deoxyhemoglobin in the executive condition and larger variation in total hemoglobin concentration in all task conditions compared to healthy controls at 70% of PPO.

Conclusion
Exercising at high intensity seems to have a larger impact on cerebral blood volume in CHD patients compared to healthy age-matched controls. Higher exercise intensity has negative impacts on cerebral blood volume variations during a cognitive task in CHD patients and could potentially lead to other neurocognitive dysfunctions. Other studies are needed to determine if a cognitive task administered during an exercise test could help identify individuals with CHD at higher risk of developing cognitive decline.},

Methods: Twenty healthy participants with a median age of 28 years (range: 18–44 years) fixated upon a vertical bar presented separately to the left and right eyes, using polarized filters, during four counterbalanced 10-min periods: (i) no accommodation/vergence conflict (Control, Ctrl); (ii) added convergence load and accommodation/vergence conflict (Conv); (iii) added cognitive load only (Cog) and; (iv) a combination of added cognitive and convergence load and accommodation/vergence conflict (Cc). Viewing distance was 65 cm. Non-invasive measurements of hemodynamic activity over the dlPFC were quantified by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). During the two-convergence load conditions, the horizontal disparity of the two bars varied dynamically from no disparity to a disparity set 20% below the individual threshold for diplopia. Cognitive load was induced by the n-back-2 test which required the subject to memorize and recall the changing colors of the horizontal bars and decide when a given color was the same as that occurring two colors previously. fNIRS data were averaged over 10-s windows centered at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 min of each task, subtracted from a 20-s baseline window immediately preceding the visual task, and then represented as changes in oxygenated hemoglobin ($\Delta$HbO2), deoxygenated hemoglobin ($\Delta$HHb) and total hemoglobin ($\Delta$tHb). Results: Linear mixed model analyses showed that hemodynamic activity was systematically influenced by time (p < 0.001). The group-averaged time-related level of change across the viewing conditions did not differ when compared with one another (p > 0.05). Larger convergence eye-movement responses under conflicting stimulus-to-accommodation, and stimulus-to-vergence over time, increased $\Delta$HbO2 and $\Delta$tHb only in condition Cc and after 8 min of task time (p < 0.10 for min-6 and min-8: p < 0.05 for min-10). Discussion: Collectively, our data suggest that HbO2, HHb, and tHb, recorded over the dlPFC with fNIRS, can be used to assay the degree to which supervisory oculomotor control processes are activated during visually deficient near work.},

abstract = {Background: The aim of this study was to compare the effects of carbohydrate (CHO) drinks (6% per volume) sweetened with maple (syrup or sap) to a commercial sports drink, glucose, and a control solution (water) on cognitive flexibility during high-intensity intermittent exercise. Methods: Eighty-five active men completed six 3-min bouts at 95% of their maximal aerobic power on a stationary bike, with 3 min of passive rest between efforts. Subjects were randomly allocated to an ingestion condition. Following each exercise bout, subjects ingested 166 mL of the experimental solution, drinking a total of 1 L of the same solution throughout the experimentation. Cognitive flexibility was measured using reaction time and accuracy on the Stroop task. The cognitive task was performed a total of 10 times, including 15 and 30 min post-exercise. Glycemia and cerebral oxygenation were also measured at each time point. Statistical analyses were performed using a two-way ANOVA (Condition × Time) with repeated measures. Results: The ingestion of maple products and the commercial sports drink led to a lesser increase in glycemia than glucose ingestion. CHO ingestion, when compared to water, induced a slight reduction in reaction times on the cognitive task, especially in the switching trials. CHO ingestion had no impact on cerebral oxygenation. Conclusions: This study shows that CHO ingestion, regardless of its type, tends to improve cognitive performance throughout exercise, especially during difficult cognitive tasks.},

From XRD, Raman spectroscopy and UV–vis DRS results, the whole composition of metal oxides exist in three phases: (fluorite phase (F) (CS10-CS30), bi-phase (fluorite (F) + cubic (C)) (CS30-CS90) and cubic phase (C) (Sm2O3)). For CSx samples, the calculated band gap energy values obtained from the UV–vis DRS results were in between 3.0–5.1 eV and fluorite phase samples (CS10–CS30) displayed lower band gap energy values (3.04–3.07 eV) than compared to the samples in other phases. Similarly, from XPS analysis, fluorite phase samples (CS10–CS30) showed higher surface oxygen vacancy concentration than compared to samples in other phases. Catalytic activity for soot oxidation is carried out on CSx samples, and the T50 temperature is in between 480–540 °C. Fluorite phase samples (CS10 CS30) showed higher surface area, lower degree of agglomeration, lower band gap energy, higher oxygen vacancy concentration and better catalytic activity for soot oxidation. Among all the CSx samples, CS10 sample displayed highest surface area (38 m2/g), lowest degree of agglomeration (0.36), lowest band gap energy (3.04 eV), highest oxygen vacancy concentration (64%) and highest soot oxidation activity (T50 = 480 °C). The order of the soot oxidation activity of CSx samples followed the same trend of band gap energy values.},

abstract = {Introduction: Cholinergic dysfunction contributes to mobility deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD). People with PD rely on limited prefrontal executive-attentional resources for the control of locomotion, including turning. Cortical and behavioral responses to cholinergic augmentation during turning remains unclear. We examined prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity while turning-in-place and spatiotemporal measures of turns in response to usual dopaminergic medication and adjunct cholinergic augmentation. Methods: This study consisted of a single-site, randomized, double-blind crossover trial. Twenty PD participants were assessed in the levodopa-off state and then randomized to either levodopa + donepezil (5 mg) or levodopa + placebo treatments for two weeks followed by a 2-week washout before crossover. The primary outcome was change from off state in PFC activity while turning-in-place (assessed with functional near-infrared spectroscopy). Secondary outcomes were changes in spatiotemporal turning measures (assessed with body-worn inertial measurement units) and accuracy in the secondary task. Results: Nineteen participants completed the trial. While levodopa + placebo had no effect on PFC activity when turning-in-place with a dual-task, levodopa + donepezil led to a large reduction in PFC activity (effect size, −0.82). Spatiotemporal measures of turning improved with both treatments, with slightly greater effect sizes observed for levodopa + donepezil. Additionally, the accuracy in the concurrent cognitive task improved only with levodopa + donepezil (effect size, 0.63). Conclusion: The addition of cholinergic therapy with donepezil (5 mg/day for 2 weeks) to standard dopaminergic therapy reduced the burden on prefrontal executive-attentional resources while turning with a dual-task and improved secondary task accuracy and turning.},

abstract = {The use of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to investigate muscle oxygenation changes during physical tasks such as rock climbing has rapidly increased within recent years; yet, there is no known measure of reliability. The current study aimed to determine intersession reliability and minimal detectable change (MDC) of continuous wave NIRS parameters during intermittent handgrip contractions in rock climbers. Thirty-two sport climbers were tested for exhaustive intermittent handgrip exercise (8-second contraction–2-second relief) at 60% of maximal voluntary contraction on 3 separate days. During each visit, continuous wave NIRS was used to determine tissue saturation index (TSI) as the measure of tissue oxygenation in the flexor digitorum profundus. To assess the intersession reliability, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), SEM, coefficient of variation (CV), and MDC were used. Mean deoxygenation during the contractions provided reliable results ($\Delta$ TSI; first trial 28.9 6 2.9%, second trial 28.8 6 2.7%, and third trial 28.4 6 2.6%; ICC = 0.692; SEM = 1.5%; CV = 17.2%; MDC = 4.2%). Mean muscle reoxygenation during the relief periods was similarly reliable ($\Delta$ TSI; first trial 9.0 6 3.1%, second trial 8.8 6 2.9%, and third trial 8.5 6 2.7%; ICC = 0.672; SEM = 1.7%; CV = 19.0%, MDC = 4.7%). As such, continuous wave NIRS provides a reliable measure of deoxygenation and reoxygenation during intermittent contractions to failure in the forearm flexors of rock climbers. Differences exceeding;4.5% for $\Delta$ TSI during contraction and relief periods should be considered meaningful.},

abstract = {Degradation of striatal dopamine in Parkinson's disease (PD) may initially be supplemented by increased cognitive control mediated by cholinergic mechanisms. Shift to cognitive control of walking can be quantified by prefrontal cortex activation. Levodopa improves certain aspects of gait and worsens others, and cholinergic augmentation influence on gait and prefrontal cortex activity remains unclear. This study examined dopaminergic and cholinergic influence on gait and prefrontal cortex activity while walking in PD. A single-site, randomized, double-blind crossover trial examined effects of levodopa and donepezil in PD. Twenty PD participants were randomized, and 19 completed the trial. Participants were randomized to either levodopa + donepezil (5 mg) or levodopa + placebo treatments, with 2 weeks with treatment and a 2-week washout. The primary outcome was change in prefrontal cortex activity while walking, and secondary outcomes were change in gait and dual-task performance and attention. Levodopa decreased prefrontal cortex activity compared with off medication (effect size, −0.51), whereas the addition of donepezil reversed this decrease. Gait speed and stride length under single- and dual-task conditions improved with combined donepezil and levodopa compared with off medication (effect size, 1 for gait speed and 0.75 for stride length). Dual-task reaction time was quicker with levodopa compared with off medication (effect size, −0.87), and accuracy improved with combined donepezil and levodopa (effect size, 0.47). Cholinergic therapy, specifically donepezil 5 mg/day for 2 weeks, can alter prefrontal cortex activity when walking and improve secondary cognitive task accuracy and gait in PD. Further studies will investigate whether higher prefrontal cortex activity while walking is associated with gait changes. {\textcopyright} 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.},

The aims of this study are to investigate the effects of video gaming (fighting and puzzle games) in the brain and the systemic physiology and to determine whether systemic responses during the gaming task are associated with the measurement of localised cerebral haemodynamic changes as measured by fNIRS. We used a continuous-wave 8-channel fNIRS system to measure the changes in concentration of oxy-haemoglobin (HbO<inf>2</inf>) and deoxy-haemoglobin (HHb) and changes in total haemoglobin ($\Delta$tHb = $\Delta$HbO<inf>2</inf> + $\Delta$HHb) over the frontal lobe in 30 healthy volunteers. The Portapres system was used to measure mean blood pressure (MBP) and heart rate (HR), and a laser Doppler was employed to measure the changes in scalp blood flow (or flux). Even though we observed significant changes in systemic variables during gaming, in particular in scalp flow, we also managed to see localised activation patterns over the frontal polar (FP1) region. However, in some channels over the frontal lobe, we also observed significant correlations between the HbO<inf>2</inf> and systemic variables. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {Purpose: This study aimed to determine the effects of hypoxia and/or blood flow restriction (BFR) on an arm-cycling repeated sprint ability test (aRSA) and its impact on elbow flexor neuromuscular function. Methods: Fourteen volunteers performed an aRSA (10 s sprint/20 s recovery) to exhaustion in four randomized conditions: normoxia (NOR), normoxia plus BFR (NBFR), hypoxia (FiO2 = 0.13, HYP) and hypoxia plus BFR (HBFR). Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), resting twitch force (Db10), and electromyographic responses from the elbow flexors [biceps brachii (BB)] to electrical and transcranial magnetic stimulation were obtained to assess neuromuscular function. Main effects of hypoxia, BFR, and interaction were analyzed on delta values from pre- to post-exercise. Results: BFR and hypoxia decreased the number of sprints during aRSA with no significant cumulative effect (NOR 16 ± 8; NBFR 12 ± 4; HYP 10 ± 3 and HBFR 8 ± 3; P < 0.01). MVC decrease from pre- to post-exercise was comparable whatever the condition. M-wave amplitude (− 9.4 ± 1.9% vs. + 0.8 ± 2.0%, P < 0.01) and Db10 force (− 41.8 ± 4.7% vs. − 27.9 ± 4.5%, P < 0.01) were more altered after aRSA with BFR compared to without BFR. The exercise-induced increase in corticospinal excitability was significantly lower in hypoxic vs. normoxic conditions (e.g., BB motor evoked potential at 75% of MVC: − 2.4 ± 4.2% vs. + 16.0 ± 5.9%, respectively, P = 0.03). Conclusion: BFR and hypoxia led to comparable aRSA performance impairments but with distinct fatigue etiology. BFR impaired the muscle excitation–contraction coupling whereas hypoxia predominantly affected corticospinal excitability indicating incapacity of the corticospinal pathway to adapt to fatigue as in normoxia.},

abstract = {Cerebral blood flow and oxygenation are crucial for maintaining healthy brain structure and function, with hypoperfusion and hypometabolism associated with neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric conditions. Chronic stress and elevated cortisol have also been associated with cognitive decline, poor mental health and peripheral vascular and cerebrovascular changes. It is plausible that glucocorticoids could alter brain structure and function through increased vulnerability to hypoperfusion and reduced oxygenation. The aim of the current study was to investigate the association between hair glucocorticoids (GCs) and frontal lobe oxygenation using near-infra red spectroscopy (NIRS) in a population sample of 1078 older adults. Data from Wave 3 of The Irish Longitudinal Study of Ageing was analysed. Hair samples were taken for the analysis of glucocorticoids and NIRS was used to measure frontal lobe oxygenation. After both minimal and full adjustment for covariates, hair cortisol and the cortisol-to-cortisone ratio were associated with lower Tissue Saturation Index (TSI; cortisol: B = −0.37, CI −0.60 to −0.14, p = .002; ratio: B = −0.43, CI −0.70 to −0.16, p = .002). Cortisone was not significantly associated with TSI (B = −0.17, CI −0.55 to.21, p = .388). The finding of an inverse relationship between frontal lobe oxygenation and GCs as assessed over a period of months may indicate that reduced oxygenation is one pathway through which chronically elevated GCs affect brain health and function. However, no causality can be inferred from the current data and prospective studies are required to interrogate this.},

abstract = {Although, there has been a significant improvement in neuroimaging technologies and analysis methods, the fundamental relationship between local changes in cerebral hemodynamics and the underlying neural activity remains largely unknown. The focus of this computational work was to understand the relation between electrophysiological and hemodynamic data acquired simultaneously from the human cortex during non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS). This computational work was performed using preliminary data collected at Prof. Perrey's Group - Neuroplasticity and Rehabilitation at the Movement to Health Laboratory, EuroMov, University of Montpellier. Prof. Perrey's Group has shown the feasibility of using a combined multi-electrode tDCS-multi channel functional NIRS setup to determine the effects of different tDCS protocols on bilateral sensorimotor cortex activation. The respective neural activity, assessed with electroencephalogram (EEG), is postulated to be closely related, spatially and temporally, to cerebral blood flow (CBF) that supplies glucose via neurovascular coupling. This hemodynamic response to neural activity can be captured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), which enables continuous monitoring of cerebral oxygenation. In this study, the NIRS-EEG joint imaging data was processed to investigate the relation between alterations in EEG band power (specifically, <12Hz based on a prior work) and oxy-hemoglobin concentration (O2Hb) in the slow frequency regime (around 0.1 Hz). Here, a computational autoregressive (ARX) model was investigated for understanding the relationship between simultaneously acquired electroencephalographic (EEG band-power <12Hz) and near infrared spectroscopic (O2Hb) data during anodal tDCS. The online parameter estimation of the ARX model was performed with a Kalman filter and this online parameter estimation technique was shown to be sensitive towards transient changes in the cross- correlation between EEG band-power and O2Hb. The computation model for online tracking of the relation between EEG band-power and O2Hb was developed which needs to be tested on a larger subject pool in the future studies. This may allow quantitative assessment of the existence of a coupling relationship between electrophysiological and hemodynamic response to NIBS in health and disease.},

Following baseline testing, participants undertook a smoking protocol involving the consumption of two cigarettes within 15 min. Measures of cerebral oxygenation and autonomic function were collected before, during, and 0 min, 30 min, 1 h, and 4 h post-smoking. Tissue saturation index (TSI) for MSM was greater than YSM during cigarette consumption (p < 0.05). Moreover, MSM observed significant within-group changes for TSI during and post-cigarette consumption (p < 0.05). Further, MSM observed an increase in low frequency (LF) band from 30 min to 1 h post-consumption, followed by a decline, whereas elevations above MSM were observed in YSM at 4 h (p < 0.05). Both MSM and YSM showed a decrease in high-frequency (HF) band post-cigarette, while increased LF/HF ratio post-consumption was observed in YSM. A decline in the standard deviation of RR intervals, post-cigarette consumption was evident in MSM (p < 0.05). Moreover, the root mean square of RR interval in both groups similarly decreased following cigarette consumption (p < 0.05). Acute smoking affects heart rate variability, suggestive of vagal withdrawal, and maybe indicate an effect of smoking history. Additionally, prolonged smoking history alters cerebral microcirculatory responses to acute tobacco exposure in MSM.},

Shaped by millions of years of evolution, the vocal recognition of emotions guides individuals in the best decision to take. The capacity to vocally express and then identify an emotion is not a distinctive characteristic of Homo sapiens. In fact, most species in the animal kingdom have such abilities that maximize their chances of survival and reproductive success. Despite homologous traits between humans and other animals, rare are the studies using a comparative approach to better understand emotional processing in voices. To fill this gap, the present thesis aims to investigate perceptual decision-making mechanisms through emotional vocalizations expressed by humans and non-human primates (NHP), our closest relatives. According to this goal, six complementary studies were performed using imaging as well as behavioral paradigms. Reference},

abstract = {The poor spatial resolution of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) makes it difficult to distinguish two closely located cortical areas from each other. Here, a combination of multi-channel NIRS and a centre of gravity (CoG) approach (widely accepted in the field of transcranial magnetic stimulation; TMS) was used to discriminate between closely located cortical areas activated during hand and foot movements. Similarly, the possibility of separating the more anteriorly represented discrete movements from rhythmic movements was studied. Thirteen healthy right-handed subjects performed rhythmic or discrete ('task') hand or foot ('extremity') tapping. Hemodynamic responses were measured using an 8-channel NIRS setup. For oxyhemoglobin (OHb) and deoxyhemoglobin (HHb), a CoG was determined for each condition using the mean hemodynamic responses and the coordinates of the channels. Significant hemodynamic responses were found for hand and foot movements. Based on the HHb responses, the NIRS-CoG of hand movements was located 0.6 cm more laterally compared to the NIRS-CoG of foot movements. For OHb responses no difference in NIRS-CoG was found for 'extremity' nor for 'task'. This is the first NIRS study showing hemodynamic responses for isolated foot movements. Furthermore, HHb responses have the potential to be used in multi-channel NIRS experiments requiring differential activation of motor cortex areas linked to either hand or foot movements. {\textcopyright} 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {For a long time continuous wave near infrared instruments have been used to detect oxygenation changes in tissue. These instruments have proven to be reliable. The new generation of instruments, such as phase-modulated systems, or time-of-flight instruments, is not yet reliable enough for clinical applications. Most available continuous wave near infrared instruments have low temporal resolution and low signal-to-noise ratio. For functional brain imaging, for example, a sensitive and fast instrument is needed. Therefore we developed the OXYMON, an instrument with a sample frequency up to 50 Hz and for optical densities up to 9 OD. The instrument uses 3 laser diodes, and is equipped with 1 or 2 avalanche photo detectors. Modular building techniques make maintenance easy.},

abstract = {Background: Despite studies investigating the effect of beetroot juice (BJ) ingestion on exercise performance in several modes of exercise, it is important to evaluate how untrained subjects respond to BJ intake during fatiguing resistance exercise. Therefore, the present study investigated the effect of BJ consumption on muscle oxygenation parameters during rhythmic handgrip exercise and exercise recovery in untrained subjects. Furthermore, exercise tolerance was also evaluated. Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, crossover fashion, thirteen healthy young subjects ingested a single dose of BJ or placebo (PLA). At 150 minutes after BJ or PLA intake, participants performed 1 bout of rhythmic handgrip exercise until fatigue and muscle oxygenation parameters were continuously monitored during exercise and exercise recovery. Results: During exercise, no significant difference in deoxygenated hemoglobin and total hemoglobin were observed after supplementation. However, a significantly faster muscle oxygen saturation during exercise recovery was observed after BJ ingestion as compared to PLA without significant changes in total hemoglobin. No significant difference in exercise tolerance after supplementation was observed. Conclusion: a single dose of BJ improves muscle reoxygenation during the recovery period of rhythmic handgrip exercise in untrained subjects, despite no changes in oxygen extraction, blood volume, and exercise tolerance.},

abstract = {Background and Objectives: The influence of interindividual differences on brain activation during obstacle negotiation and the implications for walking performance are poorly understood in older adults. This study investigated the extent to which prefrontal recruitment during obstacle negotiation is explained by differences in age, executive function, and sex. These data were interpreted according to the Compensation-Related Utilization of Neural Circuits Hypothesis (CRUNCH) framework of brain aging. We also tested the association between prefrontal recruitment and walking performance. Research Design and Methods: Prefrontal oxygenated hemoglobin concentration (O 2 Hb) was measured during typical walking (Typical) and obstacle negotiation (Obstacles) tasks in 50 adults aged 65 years and older using functional near-in-frared spectroscopy. The primary outcome was the change in prefrontal recruitment (∆PFR), measured as Obstacles ∆O 2 Hb minus Typical ∆O 2 Hb. Multiple regression was used to test the relationship between ∆PFR and age, executive function measured by the Trail Making Test, and sex. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to investigate the association between ∆PFR and the cost of Obstacles walking speed relative to Typical walking. Results: Age, executive function, and their interaction significantly predicted greater ∆PFR (R 2 = 0.34, p = .01). Participants were subgrouped according to age and executive function to examine the interaction effects. Adults of lower age and with lower executive function exhibited greater ∆PFR during Obstacles compared to their peers with higher executive function (p = .03). Adults of advanced age exhibited a ceiling of prefrontal recruitment during obstacle negotiation , regardless of executive function level (p = .87). Greater ∆PFR was significantly associated with a smaller cost of Obstacles (r = 0.3, p = .03).},

abstract = {Recently, real time imaging of the cortical control of gait became possible with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). So far, little is known about the activations of various cortical areas in more complex forms of gait, such as precision stepping. From previous work on animals and humans one would expect precision stepping to elicit extra activity in the sensorimotor cortices (S1/M1), supplementary motor area (SMA), as well as in prefrontal cortices (PFC). In the current study, hemodynamic changes in the PFC, SMA, M1, and S1 were measured with fNIRS. In contrast to previous fNIRS gait studies, the technique was optimized by the use of reference channels (to correct for superficial hemodynamic interference). Eleven subjects randomly performed ten trials of treadmill walking at 3. km/h (normal walking) and ten trials of 3. km/h treadmill walking on predefined spots for the left and right foot presented on the treadmill (precision stepping). The walking trials of approximately 35. seconds were alternated with rest periods of 25-35. seconds consisting of quiet standing. The PFC revealed profound activation just prior to the onset of both walking tasks. There was also extra activation of the PFC during the first half of the task period for precision stepping. The SMA showed mainly increased activation prior to the start of both tasks. In contrast, the sensorimotor cortex did not show a change in activation during either task as compared to a condition of standing. The SMA, M1, and S1 revealed no significant differences between normal walking and precision stepping. It was concluded that fNIRS is suited to record the planning and initiation of gait. The lack of M1/S1 activation during gait suggests that even in the current precision stepping task the control of ongoing gait depended mostly on subcortical automatisms, while motor cortex contributions did not differ between standing and walking. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Metabolic stress is a primary mechanism of muscle hypertrophy and is associated with microvascular oxygenation and muscle activation. Considering that drop-set (DS) and crescent pyramid (CP) resistance training systems are recommended to modulate these mechanisms related to muscle hypertrophy, we aimed to investigate if these resistance training systems produce a different microvascular oxygenation status and muscle activation from those observed in traditional resistance training (TRAD). Twelve volunteers had their legs randomized in an intra-subject cross-over design in TRAD (3 sets of 10 repetitions at 75% 1-RM), DS (3 sets of ∼50-75% 1-RM) and CP (3 sets of 6-10 repetitions at 75-85% 1-RM). Vastus medialis microvascular oxygenation and muscle activation were respectively assessed by non-invasive near-infrared spectroscopy and surface electromyography techniques during the resistance training sessions in the leg-extension exercise. Total hemoglobin area under the curve (AUC) (TRAD: -1653.5 ± 2866.5; DS: -3069.2 ± 3429.4; CP: -1196.6 ± 2675.3) and tissue oxygen saturation (TRAD: 19283.1 ± 6698.0; DS: 23995.5 ± 15604.9; CP: 16109.1 ± 8553.1) increased without differences between protocols (p>0.05). Greater decreases in oxygenated hemoglobin AUC and hemoglobin differentiated AUC were respectively found for DS (-4036.8 ± 2698.1; -5004.4 ± 2722.9) compared with TRAD (-1951.8 ± 1720.0; -2250.3 ± 1305.7) and CP (-1814.4 ± 2634.3; 2432.2 ± 2891.4) (p<0.03). Higher increases of hemoglobin deoxygenated AUC were found for DS (1426.7 ± 1320.7) compared with TRAD (316.0 ± 1164.9) only (p=0.04). No differences were demonstrated in electromyographic amplitudes between TRAD (69.0 ± 34.4), DS (61.3 ± 26.7) and CP (60.9 ± 38.8) (p>0.05). Despite DS produced lower microvascular oxygenation levels compared with TRAD and CP, all protocols produced similar muscle activation levels.},

abstract = {Introduction: We developed a novel device, Calmer, that mimics key components of skin-to-skin holding to reduce stress in preterm infants. Our feasibility trial showed that Calmer worked 50% better than no treatment and no differently from our standard of care, facilitated tucking (FT), for reducing pain scores during a heel lance in preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit. Objective: We compared the effects of Calmer on regional cerebral hemodynamic activity during a noxious stimulation to FT. Methods: During a clinically required heel lance, we measured frontal cortex tissue oxygenation in a subsample of 29 preterm infants (27–33 weeks gestational age) from our larger randomized controlled trial. Infants were randomized to either FT (n 5 16) or Calmer treatment (n 5 12). The outcome measure, obtained using near-infrared spectroscopy, was a change in the tissue oxygenation index (TSI) across study phases (Baseline, Heel Lance, Recovery; median duration 517 seconds [421–906 seconds]). Results: No statistically significant differences were found between groups in the median TSI during any of the study phases. In response to the heel lance, 7 infants (27.6%) had a TSI that dipped below the 60% threshold (3 in the Calmer group 25% and 4 in the FT group 25%); none below 50%. Conclusions: Infants on Calmer maintained normal regional cerebral oxygen levels (55%–85%) no differently from infants receiving a human touch intervention during blood collection. Parental skin-to-skin holding is one of the most effective strategies to relieve procedural pain in preterm infants. When parents or FT are not available, Calmer shows potential for filling this gap in care.},

abstract = {Objectives Feasibility, validity, and diagnostic accuracy of a non-invasive dynamic ambulatory test were assessed with near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) evaluating foot perfusion in peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Methods This was a prospective observational study. Eighty PAD patients (63 males, 71 ± 9 years), including 41 patients with coexisting diabetes, participated. Thirteen healthy subjects (8 males, 26 ± 8 years) were also studied by echo colour Doppler providing 160 diseased and 26 non-diseased limbs. Under identical clinostatic conditions, participants performed a 10−repetition toe flexion tests with NIRS probes on the dorsum of each foot; the area under the curve of the oxygenated haemoglobin trace (“toflex area”) was calculated and the ankle–brachial index (ABI) was measured. Time of execution, rate of wrong tests, and adverse reactions were recorded. Within session reliability was assessed by administering the test twice, with a 5 minute interval between tests. The validity was assessed determining whether the toflex area was (a) dependent on the oxygen delivery from the lower limb arteries simulating PAD conditions by a progressive blood flow restriction (40–120% of systolic pressure) in healthy subjects; (b) consistent with the degree of PAD ranked by ABI and correlated with ABI and ankle pressure values in PAD patients. The diagnostic accuracy in detecting PAD was compared with examination using echo colour Doppler ultrasound. Results All tests were rapidly, satisfactorily (<1% mistakes), and safely performed. Toflex area values, superimposable in the two sessions (intra-class correlation coefficient 0.92), were comparable to PAD values following blood flow restriction, consistent with PAD severity, correlated with dorsal pedis artery pressure (r =.21; p =.007) and ABI (r =.65; p <.001) in PAD, but not in the presence of diabetes. Toflex area was similar to echo colour Doppler for detecting PAD following receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (area = 0.987, p <.001; toflex area values ≤ −28 arbitrary units, sensitivity/specificity 95.6/100). Conclusion The toe flexion test enables ambulatory assessment of foot perfusion and PAD detection, even in the presence of non-measurable ABI or diseases affecting the microcirculation.},

Adaptation of local muscle blood flow and surface electromyography to repeated bouts of eccentric exercise. J Strength Cond Res 29(4): 1017-1026, 2015 - The aim of this randomized controlled crossover study was to investigate the effect of a bout of unaccustomed eccentric exercise (ECC) followed by a consecutive bout of the same intensity on local muscle blood flow, amplitude, and frequency of the electromyographic (EMG) signal from the exercised tibialis anterior muscle. Sixteen healthy male participants (age, 25.7 (0.6) years; body mass index 24.8 (1) kg{\textperiodcentered}m -2) participated in this study. Two identical bouts of high-intensity ECC were performed on the tibialis anterior muscle 7 days apart. Control sessions involving no exercise were performed 4 weeks either before or after the exercise sessions. Changes in local total blood flow [$\Delta$tHb], EMG root mean square, and median power frequency were recorded during isometric maximum voluntary contraction of ankle dorsiflexion. Measurements were performed before, immediately after, and the day after both ECCs (ECC1 and ECC2). The participants rested quietly in a chair in the control session. Eccentric exercise 1 led to a significant decrease in [$\Delta$tHb] on the day after (p ≤ 0.05), whereas ECC2 did not. Median power frequency decreased significantly in ECC2 compared with ECC1 (p < 0.01). Root mean square was unchanged in all the instants. The present study showed that adaptation is depicted in the local muscle blood flow and the frequency contents of the EMG after an unaccustomed ECC inducing muscle soreness. These alterations provide a potential mechanism for a rapid adaptation, which decreases susceptibility of the muscle to develop further soreness in the subsequent ECC bout.},

In adolescent patients, research is still sparse. Here, we used resting functional near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to examine oxygenation of the pre- frontal cortex (PFC) and its association with symptom severity in adolescents engaging in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and matched healthy controls (HC). Methods: Adolescents (12–17 years) with recurrent episodes of NSSI (n = 170) and healthy controls (n = 43) performed a low-demanding resting-state vanilla baseline task. Mean oxygenation of the PFC and functional connectivity within the PFC, were measured using an 8-channel functional NIRS system (Octamon, Artinis, The Netherlands). Various clinical variables derived from diagnostic interviews and self-reports were included in statistical analyses to explore potential associations with PFC oxygenation and connectivity. Results: Adolescents with NSSI showed significantly decreased PFC oxygenation compared to HC, as indexed by oxygenated hemoglobin. Lower PFC oxygenation was associated with greater adverse childhood experiences and less health-related quality of life (HRQoL). While there was no evidence for alterations in PFC connectivity in adolescents engaging in NSSI compared to HC, increased PFC connectivity in the full sample was associated with greater adverse childhood experience, greater BPD pathology, greater depression severity and psychological burden in general, as well as lower HRQoL. Conclusion: This study is the first to examine PFC oxygenation using NIRS technology in adolescents engaging in NSSI. Overall, results indicate small effects not specific to NSSI. Clinical implications of these findings and recommendations for further research are discussed.},

abstract = {The cerebral blood flow (CBF) is an important vital parameter in neurointensive care. Currently, there is no non-invasive method for its measurement that can easily be applied at the bedside. A new tool to determine CBF is based on near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) applied together with indocyanine green (ICG) dye dilution. From a bilateral measurement on selected regions on the head of infrared (IR) absorption at various wavelengths during the dilution maneuver, the vascular perfusion characteristics of the two brain hemispheres can be determined in terms of mean transit time (mtt) of ICG, cerebral blood volume (CBV) and CBF. So far, on nine healthy volunteers, NIRS ICG dye dilution bihemispheric measurements were performed, which yielded to mtt given as median (range) of 9.3 s (5.1-16.3 s), CBV of 3.5 ml/100 g (1.7-4.1 ml/100 g), and CBF of 18.2 ml/(100 g×min) [11.1-48.6 ml/(100 g×min)]. Additionally, the blood flow index (BFI) was calculated with BFI= 13.8 mg/(100 g×s) [6.6-15.2 mg/(100 g×s)]. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient between CBF and BFI was RS = 0.76. However, as the Bland & Altman plot between CBFNIRS and the CBFBFI documents, the limits of agreement are rather wide (21.9±6.7). Under physiological conditions in healthy volunteers, no differences could be detected between the hemispheres. {\textcopyright} 2008 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Many physiological measures have shown promise for detecting changes in cognitive state, and recent advances in sensor technology offer minimally-invasive ways to monitor our cognitive activity. Previous research in functional near-infrared spectroscopy, for example, has observed changes in cerebral hemodynamic response during periods of high demand within tasks. This work investigated the relationships among task demand, fatigue, and attention degradation in a sustained attention task, and their effect on heart rate, breathing rate, nose temperature and hemodynamic response in the prefrontal cortex and middle temporal gyrus. Analysis revealed a small but significant effect of fatigue on heart rate relative to baseline, breathing rate and hemodynamic response. Task demand had a small but significant effect on breathing rate and nose temperature, both relative to baseline, but no difference between levels of demand was observed in heart rate or hemodynamic response. Our results provide insight into what physiological data can tell us about cognitive state, ability to focus, and the impact of fatigue over time.},

abstract = {Assessing changes in brain activity under extreme conditions like weightlessness is a desirable, but difficult undertaking. Results from previous studies report specific changes in brain activity connected to an increase or decrease in gravity forces. Nevertheless, so far it remains unclear (1) whether this is connected to a redistribution of blood volume during micro- or hypergravity and (2) whether this redistribution might account for neurocognitive alterations. This study aimed to display changes in brain oxygenation caused by altered gravity conditions during parabolic flight. It was hypothesized that an increase in gravity would be accompanied by a decrease in brain oxygenation, whereas microgravity would lead to an increase in brain oxygenation. Oxygenized and deoxygenized haemoglobin were measured using two near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) probes on the left and right prefrontal cortex throughout ten parabolas in nine subjects. Results show a decrease of 1.44 $\mu$mol/l in oxygenized haemoglobin with the onset of hypergravity, followed by a considerable increase during microgravity (up to 5.34 $\mu$mol/l). In contrast, deoxygenized haemoglobin was not altered during the first but only during the second hypergravity phase and showed only minor changes during microgravity. Changes in oxygenized and deoxygenized haemoglobin indicate an increase in arterial flow to the brain and a decrease in venous outflow during microgravity. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Central artery stiffness was assessed by aortic pulse wave velocity (cfPWV), augmentation index (AIx) at pre and post-exercise, and 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 24 hours following the exercises. Cerebral blood flow was continuously monitored using near-infrared spectroscopy technique before and during exercise, and at 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, and 24 hours following the exercises. Cognitive function was assessed by Stroop Color-Word test at pre-exercise, and 30 minutes and 24 hours following the exercises. RESULTS: There was no significant group by time interaction in cfPWV,AIx, cerebral blood flow (HbO2) level, and cognitive function. Compared with MICE, cfPWV was increased (p=.01) at 30 minutes but AIx was decreased (p=.02) at 1 hour following HIIE. When MICE and HIIE combined, arterial stiffness and cerebral blood flow measures, and cognitive function parameters were improved following even one-bout of exercise (p≤.049). Change in AIx was associated with change in cognitive function at 30 minutes following the exercises (r=.69, p=.06). CONCLUSIONS: Even one-bout of either MIIE or HIIT acutely improves aortic wave reflection, cerebral blood flow and cognitive function in young smokers. The intensity of aerobic exercise does not seem to make meaningful differences in the positive effects on arterial stiffness, cerebral blood flow, and cognitive function in young smokers if both exercises have the same volume.},

Cognitive tasks were completed before, during and after exercise. In the dietary nitrate condition: plasma [nitrite] increased (p<. 0.01), systolic blood pressure decreased (p< 0.05) and there was a trend for a reduced oxygen uptake at 50% V̇O2peak. Tissue oxygenation improved across exercise intensities and exercise tolerance was greater at 90% V̇O2peak (p< 0.05). Rating of perceived exertion, energy levels and cognitive performance were similar between conditions with mental fatigue being evident from 70% V̇O2peak onwards (p< 0.05).

abstract = {To determine if fatigue at maximal aerobic power output was associated with a critical decrease in cerebral oxygenation, 13 male cyclists performed incremental maximal exercise tests (25 W/min ramp) under normoxic (Norm: 21% FIO2) and acute hypoxic (Hypox: 12% FIO2) conditions. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to monitor concentration ($\mu$M) changes of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin ($\Delta$[O2Hb], $\Delta$[HHb]) in the left vastus lateralis muscle and frontal cerebral cortex. Changes in total Hb were calculated ($\Delta$[THb] = $\Delta$[O2Hb] + $\Delta$[HHb]) and used as an index of change in regional blood volume. Repeated-measures ANOVA were performed across treatments and work rates ($\alpha$ = 0.05). During Norm, cerebral oxygenation rose between 25 and 75% peak power output {Power peak; increased (inc) $\Delta$[O2Hb], inc. $\Delta$[HHb], inc. $\Delta$[THb]}, but fell from 75 to 100% Powerpeak {decreased (dec) $\Delta$[O2Hb], inc. $\Delta$[HHb], no change $\Delta$[THb]}. In contrast, during Hypox, cerebral oxygenation dropped progressively across all work rates (dec. $\Delta$[O2Hb], inc. $\Delta$[HHb]), whereas $\Delta$[THb] again rose up to 75% Powerpeak and remained constant thereafter. Changes in cerebral oxygenation during Hypox were larger than Norm. In muscle, oxygenation decreased progressively throughout exercise in both Norm and Hypox (dec. $\Delta$[O2Hb], inc. $\Delta$ [HHb], inc. $\Delta$[THb]), although $\Delta$[O2Hb] was unchanged between 75 and 100% Powerpeak. Changes in muscle oxygenation were also greater in Hypox compared with Norm. On the basis of these findings, it is unlikely that changes in cerebral oxygenation limit incremental exercise performance in normoxia, yet it is possible that such changes play a more pivotal role in hypoxia.

Eleven trained runners completed a 15.6 km trail run at a competition intensity whilst wearing or not wearing CS. Counter movement jump, maximal voluntary contraction and the oxygenation profile of vastus lateralis muscle using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) method were measured before and following exercise. Run time, heart rate (HR), blood lactate concentration and ratings of perceived exertion were evaluated during the CS and non-CS sessions. No significant difference in any dependent variables was observed during the run sessions. Run times were 5681.1±503.5 and 5696.7±530.7 s for the non-CS and CS conditions, respectively. The relative intensity during CS and non-CS runs corresponded to a range of 90.5-91.5% HRmax. Although NIRS measurements such as muscle oxygen uptake and muscle blood flow significantly increased following exercise (+57.7% and + 42.6%,+59.2% and + 32.4%, respectively for the CS and non-CS sessions, P<0.05), there was no difference between the run conditions. The findings suggest that competitive runners do not gain any practical or physiological benefits from wearing CS during prolonged off-road running. {\textcopyright} 2012 {\textcopyright} 2012 European College of Sport Science.},

abstract = {New Findings: What is the central question of this study? What are the mechanisms responsible for the decline in cognitive performance following exposure to acute normobaric hypoxia? What are the main findings and their importance? We found that (1) performance of a complex central executive task (n-back) was reduced at FIO2 0.12; (2) there was a strong correlation between performance of the n-back task and reductions in SpO2 and cerebral oxygenation; and (3) plasma adrenaline, noradrenaline, cortisol and copeptin were not correlated with cognitive performance. Abstract: It is well established that hypoxia impairs cognitive function; however, the physiological mechanisms responsible for these effects have received relatively little attention. This study examined the effects of graded reductions in fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) on oxygen saturation (SpO2), cerebral oxygenation, cardiorespiratory variables, activity of the sympathoadrenal system (adrenaline, noradrenaline) and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (cortisol, copeptin), and cognitive performance. Twelve healthy males [mean (SD), age: 22 (4) years, height: 178 (5) cm, mass: 75 (9) kg, FEV1/FVC ratio: 85 (5)%] completed a four-task battery of cognitive tests to examine inhibition, selective attention (Eriksen flanker), executive function (n-back) and simple and choice reaction time (Deary–Liewald). Tests were completed before and following 60 min of exposure to (Formula presented.) 0.2093, 0.17, 0.145 and 0.12. Following 60 min of exposure, response accuracy in the n-back task was significantly reduced in FIO2 0.12 compared to baseline [82 (9) vs. 93 (5)%; P < 0.001] and compared to all other conditions at the same time point [FIO2 0.2093: 92 (3)%; (Formula presented.) 0.17: 91 (6)%; FIO2 0.145: 85 (10)%; (Formula presented.) 12: 82 (9)%; all P < 0.05]. The performance of the other tasks was maintained. $\Delta$accuracy and $\Delta$reaction time of the n-back task was correlated with both $\Delta$SpO2 [r(9) = 0.66, P < 0.001 and r(9) = −0.36, P = 0.037, respectively] and $\Delta$cerebral oxygenation [r(7) = 0.55, P < 0.001 and r(7) = −0.38, P = 0.045, respectively]. Plasma adrenaline, noradrenaline, cortisol and copeptin were not significantly elevated in any condition or correlated with any of the tests of cognitive performance. These findings suggest that reductions in peripheral oxygen saturation and cerebral oxygenation, and not increased activity of the sympathoadrenal system and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, as previously speculated, are responsible for a decrease in cognitive performance during normobaric hypoxia.},

abstract = {Background. Gait is influenced by higher order cognitive and cortical control mechanisms. Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has been used to examine frontal activation during walking in healthy older adults, reporting increased oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) levels during dual task walking (DT), compared with usual walking. Objective. To investigate the role of the frontal lobe during DT and obstacle negotiation, in healthy older adults and patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods. Thirty-eight healthy older adults (mean age 70.4 ± 0.9 years) and 68 patients with PD (mean age 71.7 ± 1.1 years,) performed 3 walking tasks: (a) usual walking, (b) DT walking, and (c) obstacles negotiation, with fNIRS and accelerometers. Linear-mix models were used to detect changes between groups and within tasks. Results. Patients with PD had higher activation during usual walking (P <.030). During DT, HbO2 increased only in healthy older adults (P <.001). During obstacle negotiation, HbO2 increased in patients with PD (P =.001) and tended to increase in healthy older adults (P =.053). Higher DT and obstacle cost (P <.003) and worse cognitive performance were observed in patients with PD (P =.001). Conclusions. A different pattern of frontal activation during walking was observed between groups. The higher activation during usual walking in patients with PD suggests that the prefrontal cortex plays an important role already during simple walking. However, higher activation relative to baseline during obstacle negotiation and not during DT in the patients with PD demonstrates that prefrontal activation depends on the nature of the task. These findings may have important implications for rehabilitation of gait in patients with PD.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of in vivo quantitative near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in skeletal muscle at various workloads. NIRS was used for the quantitative measurement of O2 consumption (mVO2) in the human flexor digitorum superficialis muscle at rest and during rhythmic isometric handgrip exercise in a broad range of work intensities (10-90% MVC = maximum voluntary contraction force). Six subjects were tested on three separate days. No significant differences were found in mVO2 measured over different days with the exception of the highest workload. The within-subject variability for each workload measured over the three measurements days ranged from 15.7 to 25.6% and did not increase at the high workloads. The mVO2 was 0.14 ± 0.01 mlO2 min-1 100 g-1 at rest and increased roughly 19 times to 2.68 ± 0.58 mlO2 min-1 100 g-1 at 72% MVC. These results show that local muscle oxygen consumption at rest as well as during exercise at a broad range of work intensities can be measured reliably by NIRS, applied to a uniform selected subject population. This is of great importance as direct local measurement of mVO2 during exercise is not possible with the conventional techniques. The method is robust enough to measure over separate days and at various workloads and can therefore contribute to a better understanding of human physiology in both the normal and pathological state of the muscle.},

abstract = {Background: Obstacle negotiation is a daily activity that requires the integration of sensorimotor and cognitive information. Recent studies provide evidence for the important role of prefrontal cortex during obstacle negotiation. We aimed to explore the effects of obstacle height and available response time on prefrontal activation. Methods: Twenty healthy young adults (age: 30.1 ± 1.0 years; 50% women) walked in an obstacle course while negotiating anticipated and unanticipated obstacles at heights of 50 mm and 100 mm. Prefrontal activation was measured using a functional near-infrared spectroscopy system. Kinect cameras measured the obstacle negotiation strategy. Prefrontal activation was defined based on mean level of HbO2 before, during and after obstacle negotiation and the HbO2 slope from gait initiation and throughout the task. Changes between types of obstacles were assessed using linear-mix models and partial correlation analyses evaluated the relationship between prefrontal activation and the distance between the feet as the subjects traversed the obstacles. Results: Different obstacle heights showed similar changes in prefrontal activation measures (p > 0.210). However, during unanticipated obstacles, the slope of the HbO2 response was steeper (p = 0.048), as compared to anticipated obstacles. These changes in prefrontal activation during negotiation of unanticipated obstacles were correlated with greater distance of the leading foot after the obstacles (r = 0.831, p = 0.041). Conclusions: These findings are the first to show that the pattern of prefrontal activation depends on the nature of the obstacle. More specifically, during unanticipated obstacles the recruitment of the prefrontal cortex is faster and greater than during negotiating anticipated obstacles. These results provide evidence of the important role of the prefrontal cortex and the ability of healthy young adults to tailor the activation pattern to different types of obstacles.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Authors.The purpose of this research was to waterproof a near-infrared spectroscopy device (PortaMon, Artinis Medical Systems) to enable NIR measurement during swim exercise. Candidate materials were initially tested for waterproof suitability by comparing light intensity values during phantom-based tissue assessment. Secondary assessment involved repeated isokinetic exercises ensuring reliability of the results obtained from the modified device. Tertiary assessment required analysis of the effect of water immersion and temperature upon device function. Initial testing revealed that merely covering the PortaMon light sources with waterproof materials considerably affected the NIR light intensities. Modifying a commercially available silicone covering through the addition of a polyvinyl chloride material (impermeable to NIR light transmission) produces an acceptable compromise. Bland-Altman analysis indicated that exercise-induced changes in tissue saturation index (TSI %) were within acceptable limits during laboratory exercise. Although water immersion had a small but significant effect upon NIR light intensity, this resulted in a negligible change in the measured TSI (%). We then tested the waterproof device in vivo illustrating oxygenation changes during a 100 m freestyle swim case study. Finally, a full study compared club level swimmers and triathletes. Significant changes in oxygenation profiles when comparing upper and lower extremities for the two groups were revealed, reflecting differences in swim biomechanics.},

Participants (n=13) who performed the SWC in a shorter time had significantly lower air cylinder ventilation values on the T10 (r=-0.495), better peak oxygen consumption (r=-0.924) during the GWT and significantly greater skeletal muscle oxygen extraction during the SWC (HbDiff, r=0.768).

abstract = {Objective: Research on methods of improving the affective experience of exercise remains limited, especially for low-active overweight adults. We investigated the effectiveness of a virtual-reality headset and headphones in improving affective responses over conventionally delivered audiovisual stimulation. Methods: Low-active, overweight adults (16 women, 5 men; age: 34.67 ± 9.62 years; body mass index: 28.56 ± 4.95 kg/m²; peak oxygen uptake for men: 29.14 ± 6.56 mL/kg/min, for women: 22.67 ± 4.52 mL/kg/min, mean ± SD) completed 15-min sessions of recumbent cycling at the ventilatory threshold: (a) high immersion (HI, virtual reality headset and headphones), (b) low immersion (LI, television screen and speakers), and (c) Control. During-exercise pleasure and post-exercise enjoyment were self-reported. Oxygenation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) was assessed with near infrared spectroscopy. Results: Higher pleasure was reported during HI than during LI and Control (Condition × Time interaction; p < 0.001, $\eta$p2 = 0.43). Participants who reported a preference for low exercise intensity showed higher dlPFC oxygenation during Control, but this difference diminished during LI and HI (Condition × Time × Preference interaction; p = 0.036, $\eta$p2 = 0.10). Conclusion: Compared with conventionally delivered audiovisual stimulation, using a virtual-reality headset strengthens the dissociative effect, further improving affective responses to exercise at the ventilatory threshold among overweight, low-active adults. Presumably by competing with interoceptive afferents at the level of sensory input, audiovisual stimulation may lessen reliance on cognitive efforts to attenuate declining affect, as indicated by lower right dlPFC activity, particularly among participants disinclined toward high exercise intensity.},

abstract = {The bone vascular system is important; yet, evaluation of bone hemodynamics is difficult and expensive. This study evaluated the utility and reliability of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), a portable and relatively inexpensive device, in measuring tibial hemodynamics and metabolic rate. Eleven participants were tested twice using post-occlusive reactive hyperemia technique with the NIRS probes placed on the tibia and the medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle. Measurements were made at rest and after two levels of plantarflexion exercise. The difference between oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin signal (HbDiff) could be reliably measured with small coefficients of variation (CV; range 5.7 – 9.8%) and high intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC; range 0.73 – 0.91). Deoxygenated hemoglobin rate of change, a potential marker for bone metabolism, also showed good reliability (CV range 7.5 – 9.8%, ICC range 0.90 – 0.93). The tibia was characterized with a much slower metabolic rate compared to MG (p < 0.001). While exercise significantly increased MG metabolic rate in a dose-dependent manner (all p < 0.05), no changes were observed for the tibia after exercise compared to rest (all p > 0.05). NIRS is a suitable tool for monitoring hemodynamics and metabolism in the tibia. However, the local muscle exercise protocol utilized in the current study did not influence bone hemodynamics or metabolic rate. Novelty bullets • NIRS can be used to monitor tibial hemodynamics and metabolism with good reliability. • Short-duration local muscle exercise increased metabolic rate in muscle but not in bone. • High level of loading and exercise volume may be needed to elicit measurable metabolic changes in bone.},

abstract = {Cognitive training has been shown to result in improved behavioral performance in normal aging and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), yet little is known about the neural correlates of cognitive plasticity, or about individual differences in responsiveness to cognitive training. In this study, 21 healthy older adults and 14 patients with MCI received five weeks of adaptive computerized working-memory (WM) training. Before and after training, functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to assess the hemodynamic response in left and right prefrontal cortex during performance of a verbal n-back task with varying levels of WM load. After training, healthy older adults demonstrated decreased prefrontal activation at high WM load, which may indicate increased processing efficiency. Although MCI patients showed improved behavioral performance at low WM load after training, no evidence was found for training-related changes in prefrontal activation. Whole-group analyses showed that a relatively strong hemodynamic response at low WM load was related to worse behavioral performance, while a relatively strong hemodynamic response at high WM load was related to higher training gain. Therefore, a ‘youth-like' prefrontal activation pattern at older age may be associated with better behavioral outcome and cognitive plasticity.},

Twelve young men completed the 3 protocols with equal overall effort. Simultaneous and continuous recordings of central hemodynamics, muscle oxygenation/deoxygenation and VO<inf>2</inf> were performed. Peak responses for stroke volume and peripheral resistance did not differ among protocols, whereas peak cardiac output and VO<inf>2</inf> were higher in long-interval vs. continuous and short-interval protocols with inactive rest phases (p<0.05). The average responses for all central parameters were higher in continuous and long-interval vs. short-interval exercise (p<0.05); average VO<inf>2</inf> and exercise-time above 80% VO<inf>2max</inf> were also higher in continuous and long-interval vs. short-interval protocol (p<0.05). Muscle de-oxygenation (↑$\Delta$deoxyhemoglobin,↓$\Delta$oxyhemoglobin, ↓muscle O<inf>2</inf>-saturation), as well as the mismatch of O<inf>2</inf> delivery and utilization ($\Delta$deoxyhemoglobin/VO<inf>2</inf>) were remarkably alike among protocols. In conclusion, all 3 protocols resulted in a great activation of central and peripheral determinants of VO<inf>2</inf>. When performed with equal overall effort, the intense continuous and interval modalities reveal similarities in muscle O<inf>2</inf>-utilization response, but differences in central hemodynamic and VO<inf>2</inf> responses. Intense continuous and long-interval protocols exert a more commanding role on the cardiovascular system and VO<inf>2</inf> response compared to short-interval exercise with inactive rest phases.},

abstract = {Recent studies have suggested that deficits in executive function contribute to freezing of gait (FOG), an episodic disturbance common among patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). To date, most findings provide only indirect evidence of this relationship. Here, we evaluated a more direct link between FOG and frontal lobe dysfunction. Functional, near infrared spectroscopy measured frontal activation, i.e., oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) levels in Brodmann area 10 before and during FOG. Eleven patients with PD and eleven healthy older adults were studied. Changes in frontal lobe activation before and during FOG that occurred during turns were determined. Altogether, 49 FOG episodes were observed—28 occurred during turns that were anticipated (i.e., the patient knew in advance that the turn was coming), 21 during unanticipated turns that were performed “abruptly”, according to the examiner's request. During anticipated turns, HbO2 increased by 0.22 ± 0.08 µM (p = 0.004) before FOG and by an additional 0.19 ± 0.13 µM (p = 0.072) during FOG. In contrast, during unanticipated turns, HbO2 did not increase before or during FOG. HbO2 decreased by 0.32 ± 0.08 µM (p = 0.004) during turns without FOG; in healthy controls HbO2 did not change during turns. These findings support the existence of an association between FOG episodes and changes in frontal lobe HbO2. Increased activation in Brodmann area 10 before FOG, specifically during anticipated turns, highlights the connections between motor planning, information processing, and FOG. These results support the idea that alterations in executive control play a role in this debilitating motor disturbance.},

abstract = {Age-related changes may affect the performance during fast walking speed. Although, several studies have been focused on the contribution of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during challenging walking tasks, the neural mechanism underling fast walking speed in older people remain poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of aging on PFC activity during overground walking at preferred and fast speeds. Twenty-five older adults (67.37 ± 5.31 years) and 24 young adults (22.70 ± 1.30 years) walked overground in two conditions: preferred speed and fast walking speed. Five trials were performed for each condition. A wireless functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) system measured PFC activity. Gait parameters were evaluated using the GAITRite system. Overall, older adults presented higher PFC activity than young adults in both conditions. Speed-related change in PFC activity was observed for older adults, but not for young adults. Older adults significantly increased activity in the left PFC from the preferred to fast walking condition whereas young adults had similar levels of PFC activity across conditions. Our findings suggest that older adults need to recruit additional prefrontal cognitive resources to control walking, indicating a compensatory mechanism. In addition, left PFC seems to be involved in the modulation of gait speed in older adults.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of in vivo quantitative near- infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in skeletal muscle at various workloads. NIRS was used for the quantitative measurement of O2 consumption (m _VO2) in the human flexor digitorum superficialis muscle at rest and during rhythmic isometric handgrip exercise in a broad range of work intensities (10–90% MVC¼maximum voluntary contraction force). Six subjects were tested on three separate days. No significant differences were found in m _VO2 measured over different days with the exception of the highest workload. The within-subject variability for each workload measured over the three measurements days ranged from 15{\AE}7to25{\AE}6% and did not increase at the high workloads. The m _VO2 was 0{\AE}14 ± 0{\AE}01 mlO2 min–1 100 g–1 at rest and increased roughly 19 times to 2{\AE}68 ± 0{\AE}58 mlO2 min–1 100 g–1 at 72% MVC. These results show that local muscle oxygen consumption at rest as well as during exercise at a broad range of work intensities can be measured reliably by NIRS, applied to a uniform selected subject population. This is of great importance as direct local measurement of m _VO2 during exercise is not possible with the conventional techniques. The method is robust enough to measure over separate days and at various workloads and can therefore contribute to a better understanding of human physiology in both the normal and pathological state of the muscle.

abstract = {Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) both allow non-invasive monitoring of cerebral cortical oxygenation responses to various stimuli. To compare these methods in elderly subjects and to determine the effect of age on cortical oxygenation responses, we determined motor-task-related changes in deoxyhemoglobin concentration ([HHb]) over the left motor cortex in six healthy young subjects (age 35 ± 9 years, mean ± SD) and five healthy elderly subjects (age 73 ± 3 years) by NIRS and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI simultaneously. The motor-task consisted of seven cycles of 20-sec periods of contralateral finger-tapping at a rate as fast as possible alternated with 40-sec periods of rest. Time-locked averages over the seven cycles were used for further analysis. Task-related decreases in [HHb] over the motor cortex were measured by NIRS, with maximum changes of -0.83 ± 0.38 $\mu$mol/L (P < 0.01) for the young and -0.32 ± 0.17 $\mu$mol/L (P < 0.05) for the elderly subjects. The BOLD-fMRI signal increased over the cortex volume under investigation with NIRS, with maximum changes of 2.11 ± 0.72% (P < 0.01) for the young and 1.75 ± 0.71% (P < 0.01) for the elderly subjects. NIRS and BOLD-fMRI measurements showed good correlation in the young (r = -0.70, r2 = 0.48, P < 0.001) and elderly subjects (r = -0.82, r2 = 0.67, P < 0.001). Additionally, NIRS measurements demonstrated age-dependent decreases in task-related cerebral oxygenation responses (P < 0.05), whereas fMRI measurements demonstrated smaller areas of cortical activation in the elderly subjects (P < 0.05). These findings demonstrate that NIRS and fMRI similarly assess cortical oxygenation changes in young subjects and also in elderly subjects. In addition, cortical oxygenation responses to brain activation alter with aging. {\textcopyright} 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@thesis{AnthonyVincentIncognito2020,
abstract = {Background: The sympathetic nervous system plays a critical role in blood pressure regulation at rest and during stress. Sympathetic neural activity directed towards skeletal muscle constricts the vasculature to raise resistance within the arterial tree. Interestingly, within a bundle of muscle sympathetic nerves, despite being directed towards the same skeletal muscle vascular targets, the regulation of each fibre can be different in response to the same stress. Largely unknown are the control systems underpinning this level of differential control. Purpose: The present thesis aimed at quantifying differential control patterns of individual muscle sympathetic fibres in response to different physiological stressors in young healthy humans. Methods: Muscle sympathetic nerve activity was recorded using microelectrode placement into the fibular nerve (microneurography). Tracking the activity of individual muscle sympathetic fibres within the nerve bundle was achieved using action potential amplitude and waveform matching techniques. Results: We observed individual muscle sympathetic single units to be either activated, non- responsive, or inhibited, during cardiopulmonary baroreceptor unloading (non-hypotensive lower body negative pressure), arterial baroreceptor unloading and loading (sequential bolus injections of a vasodilator and vasoconstrictor agent, respectively), rhythmic handgrip exercise, and isolated muscle metaboreflex activation (post-exercise circulatory occlusion after a static handgrip contraction). We demonstrate that single units do not have fixed response patterns but rather their directionality of response are dependent on the level of sympathoexcitation. Conclusions: The findings of this thesis establish differential control as a normal phenomenon of sympathetic regulation, which is likely mediated by different response thresholds within central autonomic circuitry and the result of summation of multiple neural inputs. Thus, individual postganglionic fibres can engage in multiple response patterns dependent on the milieu of summated neural inputs within the brainstem and the weighted influence of these neural inputs on the activity of each single unit.},

Methods: Children with JDM, children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (clinical controls), and healthy children performed a maximal incremental cycloergometric test from which normalized concentration changes in oxygenated hemoglobin ($\Delta$[O2Hb]) and total hemoglobin ($\Delta$[tHb]) as well as the half-recovery times of both signals were determined from the vastus medialis and vastus lateralis muscles using near-infrared spectroscopy. Results: Children with JDM had lower $\Delta$[tHb] values in the vastus medialis at work rates of 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of maximal compared with healthy children; the increase in $\Delta$[tHb] with increasing intensity seen in healthy children was absent in children with JDM. Other outcome measures did not differ by group. Conclusions: The results suggest that children with JDM may experience difficulties in increasing muscle blood volume with more strenuous exercise. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The present study investigated the effect of ischaemia–reperfusion duration within each IPC cycle on performance in a 2000-m rowing ergometer test. Methods: After incremental and familiarization tests, 16 trained rowers (mean ± SD: age, 24 ± 11 years; weight, 74.1 ± 5.9 kg; V˙ O 2 peak, 67.2 ± 7.4 mL{\textperiodcentered}kg−1{\textperiodcentered}min−1) were randomly submitted to a 2000-m rowing test preceded by intermittent bilateral cuff inflation of the lower limbs with three cycles of ischaemia–reperfusion, lasting 5 min (IPC-5) or 10 min (IPC-10) at 220 or 20 mmHg (control). Power output, V˙ O 2, heart rate, blood lactate concentration, pH, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), and near-infrared spectroscopy-derived measurements of the vastus lateralis muscle were continuously recorded. Results: No differences among treatments were found in the 2000-m test (control: 424 ± 17; IPC-5: 425 ± 16; IPC-10: 424 ± 17 s; P = 0.772). IPC-10 reduced the tissue saturation index and oxy-haemoglobin concentration during exercise compared with control. The power output during the last 100-m segment was significantly lower with IPC-10. The IPC treatments increased the heart rate over the first 500 m and decreased the pH after exercise. No alterations were observed in V˙ O 2, blood lactate, or RPE among the trials. Conclusion: In conclusion, IPC does not improve the 2000-m rowing ergometer performance of trained athletes regardless of the length of ischaemia–reperfusion cycles.},

abstract = {Previous research showed that children's physical activity is positively related to executive functions, whilst screen time shows negative associations. However, it is unclear how school-based sitting time and transitions from sitting to standing relate to cognition. We investigated the relationship between class time sitting/stepping/sit-to-stand transitions and cognitive functions in Grade 1–2 children. Overall, 149 children (7.7 ± 0.6 years old, 54% boys) participated. Measures included class time sitting/stepping/sit-to-stand transitions and: (i) response inhibition (i.e., response time and accuracy); (ii) lapses of attention; (iii) working memory; and (iv) brain activity (cortical haemodynamic response). Linear mixed-models, adjusting for age, sex, and clustering at the classroom level, found that more sitting time was associated with higher lapses of attention ($\beta$ = 0.12, p < 0.05). Children who stepped more had quicker inhibition response time ($\beta$ = −0.95, p < 0.01); however, they were less accurate in their responses ($\beta$ = −0.30, p < 0.05) and this was also observed with sit-to-stand transitions ($\beta$ = −0.26, p < 0.05). No associations were found with brain activity. In conclusion, reducing and breaking up sitting may help keep children focused, but the evidence regarding response inhibition is unclear.},

Methods This study used NIRS to measure changes in oxygenated (HbO), deoxygenated (HbR), and total hemoglobin (HbT) at left and right side of the frontal lobe in 33 patients with epilepsy undergoing long-term video-EEG monitoring. Fifteen patients had 34 focal seizures (20 temporal-, 11 frontal-, 2 parietal-lobe, one unspecific) recorded and analyzed with NIRS. Twelve parameters consisting of maximum increase and decrease changes of HbO, HbR and HbT during seizures (1 min before- to 3 min after seizure-onset) for left and right side, were compared with the patients' own non-seizure periods (a 2-h period and a 30-min exercise-period). In both non-seizure periods a 4 min moving windows with maximum overlapping were applied to find non-seizure maxima of the 12 parameters. Detection was defined as positive when seizure maximum change exceeded non-seizure maximum change. Results When analyzing the 12 parameters separately the positive seizure detection was in the range of 6-24%. The increase in hemodynamics was in general better at detecting seizures (15-24%) than the decrease in hemodynamics (6-18%) (P = 0.02). Conclusion NIRS did not seem to be a suitable technology for generic seizure detection given the device, settings, and methods used in this study. There are still several challenges to overcome before the NIRS-technology can be used as a home-monitoring seizure detection device.},

abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the involvement of cerebral oxygenation in limitation of maximal exercise. We hypothesized that O2 supplementation improves physical performance in relation to its effect on cerebral oxygenation during exercise. Eight untrained men (age 27 ± 6 years; VO2max 45 ± 8 ml min-1 kg-1) performed two randomized exhaustive ramp exercises on a cycle ergometer (1 W/3 s) under normoxia and hyperoxia (FIO2 = 0.3). Cerebral ($\Delta$COx) and muscular ($\Delta$MOx) oxygenation responses to exercise were monitored using near-infrared spectroscopy. Power outputs corresponding to maximal exercise intensity, to threshold of $\Delta$COx decline (ThCOx) and to the respiratory compensation point (RCP) were determined. Power output W max = 302 ± 20 vs. 319 ± 28 W) and arterial O 2 saturation estimated by pulse oximetry (SpO2 = 95.7 ± 0.9 vs. 97.0 ± 0.5 %) at maximal exercise were increased by hyperoxia (P < 0.05). However, the $\Delta$MOx response during exercise was not significantly modified with hyperoxia. RCP (259 ± 17 vs. 281 ± 25 W) and ThCOx (259 ± 23 vs. 288 ± 30 W) were, however, improved (P < 0.05) with hyperoxia and the ThCOx shift was related to the (Wmax improvement with hyperoxia (r = 0.71, P < 0.05). The relationship between the change in cerebral oxygenation response to exercise and the performance improvement with hyperoxia supports that cerebral oxygenation is limiting the exercise performance in healthy young subjects. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is often classified into tremor dominant (TD) and postural instability gait disorder (PIGD) subtypes. Degeneration of subcortical/cortical pathways is different between PD subtypes, which leads to differences in motor behavior. However, the influence of PD subtype on cortical activity during walking remains poorly understood. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the influence of PD motor subtypes on cortical activity during unobstructed walking and obstacle avoidance. Seventeen PIGD and 19 TD patients performed unobstructed walking and obstacle avoidance conditions. Brain activity was measured using a mobile functional near-infrared spectroscopy–electroencephalography (EEG) systems, and gait parameters were analyzed using an electronic carpet. Concentrations of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and EEG absolute power from alpha, beta, and gamma bands in FCz, Cz, CPz, and Oz channels were calculated. These EEG channels correspond to supplementary motor area, primary motor cortex, posterior parietal cortex, and visual cortex, respectively. Postural instability gait disorder patients presented higher PFC activity than TD patients, regardless of the walking condition. Tremor dominant patients presented reduced beta power in the Cz channel during obstacle avoidance compared to unobstructed walking. Both TD and PIGD patients decreased alpha and beta power in the FCz and CPz channels. In conclusion, PIGD patients need to recruit additional cognitive resources from the PFC for walking. Both TD and PIGD patients presented changes in the activation of brain areas related to motor/sensorimotor areas in order to maintain balance control during obstacle avoidance, being that TD patients presented further changes in the motor area (Cz channel) to avoid obstacles.},

abstract = {Background: Fetal well-being is determined in large part by how well the placenta is able to supply oxygen and nutrients, but current technology is unable to directly measure how well a placenta functions. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) utilizes optical methods to measure tissue oxygenation. This pilot project evaluated the feasibility of NIRS for fetal monitoring through the maternal abdominal wall using a sheep model. Methods: A miniature wireless 2-wavelength NIRS device was placed on the abdominal skin over the placenta of a pregnant ewe whose fetus had been chronically catheterized to allow arterial sampling for measurement of arterial oxygen saturation. The NIRS device has 3-paired light emitting diodes and a single photodiode detector; allowing measurement of an index of tissue oxygen saturation (TSI%). Fetal limb TSI% values were compared before and during fetal breathing movements. Correlation was made during these events between arterial values and placental TSI% monitored continuously in real time. Results: Serial measurements were obtained in a single experiment. The correlation between transcutaneous NIRS derived TSI% and direct arterial oxygen saturation was very high (R2=0.86). Measures of fetal limb TSI% were declined after episodes of fetal breathing (P < 0.005). Conclusions: This correlation suggests that NIRS is sensitive enough to detect changes in fetal tissue oxygenation noninvasively through the maternal abdominal wall in real-time in a sheep model. NIRS data confirmed that fetal breathing movements decrease arterial oxygen saturation in fetal lambs. If validated by further study this optical methodology could be applied as means of monitoring fetal wellbeing in humans. {\textcopyright} 2012 SPIE.},

abstract = {Background: The objective of this paper was to evaluate the potential individual and combined effects of acute exercise coupled with bilateral interhemispheric activation on episodic memory function. Six experiments were conducted. Methods: Experiment 1 was a within-subject, counterbalanced experiment. Participants completed four visits, including 1) exercise and saccadic eye movements, 2) exercise only, 3) saccadic eye movements only, and 4) no exercise and no saccadic eye movements (control). A word-list memory assessment was employed, including a long-term (20-min delay) memory evaluation. In Experiment 2, we evaluated the effects of saccadic eye movements on prefrontal cortex oxygenation, a proxy for neuronal activity. Similarly, in our third experiment, we evaluated the effects of acute exercise on prefrontal cortex oxygenation. Thus, experiments 2 and 3 were employed to provide mechanistic insights from the results shown in experiment 1. Experiment 4 replicated Experiment 1, but instead of increasing prefrontal cortex activation via saccadic eye movements, we used a fist clenching protocol. Experiment 5 evaluated the effects of fist clenching on prefrontal cortex oxygenation. Results: Collectively, these 5 experimental studies showed that acute exercise (Experiment 1), saccadic eye movements (Experiment 1), and fist clenching (Experiment 4) enhanced memory function, and that acute exercise (Experiment 3), saccadic eye movements (Experiment 2) and fist clenching (Experiment 5) all increased prefrontal cortex oxygenation. Experiment 6 demonstrated that prefrontal cortex oxygenation was positively associated with episodic memory function. Conclusion: These six experiments suggest that several behaviors, such as acute exercise, saccadic eye movements and fist clenching may improve memory function and may, potentially, do so via increases in prefrontal cortex oxygenation.},

abstract = {Purpose: To determine whether near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements of muscle mitochondrial function could detect the expected differences between endurance-trained athletes (n = 8) and inactive subjects (n = 8). Methods: Muscle oxygen consumption (mV̇O2) of the vastus lateralis was measured with continuous-wave NIRS using transient arterial occlusions. The recovery rate of mV̇O2 after electrical stimulation was fit to an exponential curve, with the time constant (T C) used as an index of mitochondrial capacity. Whole-body peak oxygen uptake was determined by indirect calorimetry during a continuous ramp protocol on a cycle ergometer. Results: Whole-body peak oxygen uptake values for endurance-trained and inactive controls were 73.5 ± 9.1 and 33.7 ± 5.9 mL{\textperiodcentered}kg-1{\textperiodcentered}min-1, respectively (P < 0.001). The recovery rates of mV̇O2 after exercise for endurance training were 18.4 ± 3.2 and 18.8 ± 2.5 s, whereas those for inactive controls were 32.4 ± 5.2 and 34.9 ± 5.9 s for the shallow and deep channels, respectively (P < 0.001 for comparison between groups). Resting mV̇O2 was 0.52%{\textperiodcentered}s-1 ± 0.22%{\textperiodcentered}s-1 for endurance athletes and 0.77%{\textperiodcentered}s -1 ± 0.82%{\textperiodcentered}s-1 for inactive controls (P = 0.42). Conclusions: The recovery rates of mV̇O2 after exercise in endurance athletes were almost twofold faster than inactive subjects measured with NIRS, consistent with previous studies using muscle biopsies and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Our results support the use of NIRS measurements of the recovery of oxygen consumption to assess muscle oxidative capacity.

abstract = {Aims/hypothesis: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a risk factor for the development of endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease. However, in vivo microvascular endothelial function in GDM has not been investigated. This study aimed to examine, using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), whether: (1) there are differences in microvascular reactivity and skeletal muscle oxygen consumption (mV⋅ O 2) at rest and during exercise between GDM and uncomplicated pregnancies; and (2) there is an association of NIRS indices with macrovascular function and cardiovascular disease risk factors. Methods: Twenty-nine pregnant women (13 with GDM and 16 women with uncomplicated pregnancy, 28 ± 2 gestational weeks) underwent arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity [PWV]) and 24 h ambulatory BP (24 h BP) evaluation. NIRS continuously monitored, non-invasively, changes in muscle oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin and tissue O2 saturation index (TSI, %) during arterial occlusion/reperfusion and intermittent handgrip exercise. mV⋅ O 2 and vascular reactivity indices were calculated. Results: During occlusion and reperfusion, women with GDM exhibited slower TSI response (occlusion slope: −0.06 ± 0.02 vs −0.10 ± 0.04, in GDM and controls, respectively; reperfusion slope: 0.65 ± 0.26 vs 1.05 ± 0.41, respectively), lower mV⋅ O 2 (1.3 ± 1.2 vs 3.8 ± 2.3 $\mu$mol l−1 min−1) and blunted hyperaemia ($\Delta$TSI 6.8 ± 2.9 vs 9.5 ± 3.4) compared with controls (p < 0.01). Despite similar handgrip strength in the GDM and control groups (29.1 ± 8.1 vs 26.2 ± 10.4 kg, respectively), during repeated forearm contractions, women with GDM presented a blunted TSI response (6.5 ± 3.9 vs 19.2 ± 10.9; p < 0.01) and a reduced capacity to maintain the predetermined handgrip (23.4 ± 2.9 vs 27.4 ± 3.8%, p < 0.05). NIRS indices correlated with PWV, 24 h BP and blood glucose concentration earlier in pregnancy (r = 0.40–0.60; p < 0.05). Conclusions/interpretation: Women with GDM exhibited a characteristic blunted TSI curve, showing alterations in muscle oxygenation and microvascular responsiveness compared with women with uncomplicated pregnancies. These alterations were manifested during exercise and possibly contribute to the reduced exercise tolerance in GDM. NIRS indices correlated with macrovascular indices (arterial stiffness) and 24 h BP.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine whether circulatory occlusion of the hand impacts on regional forearm muscle haemodynamics as determined by the near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) venous occlusion technique (NIRSVOT). Twenty-five young, healthy participants (18 males and 7 females; 28 ± 4 years; 71 ± 7 kg) completed two experimental protocols that were performed on the dominant arm: (1) a series of five venous occlusion trials with a suprasystolic cuff (>260 mmHg) applied to the wrist and (2) five venous occlusion trials without hand-occlusion. Both protocols were performed twice in a counterbalanced manner. NIRS data were obtained from the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) muscle using a dual wavelength, continuouswave spectrophotometer. FDS muscle blood flow (QFDS), vascular conductance (CFDS), O2 consumption (VFDS), and venous O2 saturation (SvO2) were calculated from NIRS data during the initial 5 s of venous occlusion. Circulatory occlusion of the hand via wrist cuffing significantly (P < 0.05) reduced QFDS (-36 ± 23%), CFDS (-37 ± 23%), Vo2FDS (-14 ± 31%) and SvO2 (-14 ± 12%). These findings indicate that hand-occlusion, via wrist cuffing, adversely impacts on regional forearm haemodynamics as determined by the NIRS-VOT. Consequently, it is recommended that future investigators avoid hand-occlusion when using the NIRS-VOT to quantify spontaneous haemodynamics of regional forearm muscle.},

Blood flow response was evaluated in the common femoral artery by Eco-Doppler during 1 min of passive leg movements (PLM). The intramuscular matching between O 2 delivery and Lucrezia Zuccarelli completed her BSc and MSc in Sport Science at the University of Milan. During her masters she was a visiting student at the European Space Agency in Cologne. She moved to Udine and completed her PhD in Biomedical Sciences at the University of Udine. Her research activity focuses on the functional evaluation of oxidative metabolism during exercise along the oxygen pathway from the ambient air to skeletal muscle mitochondria in physiological and non-physiological conditions. O 2 utilization was evaluated by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Mitochondrial respiration was evaluated ex vivo by high-resolution respirometry in isolated muscle fibres, and in vivo by NIRS by the evaluation of skeletal muscle V˙O 2 (V˙O 2 m) recovery kinetics. Resting V˙O 2 m was estimated by NIRS. Peak V˙O 2 p was lower in POST vs. PRE. The area under the blood flow vs. time curve during PLM was smaller (P = 0.03) in POST (274 ± 233 mL) vs. PRE (427 ± 291). An increased (P = 0.03) overshoot of muscle deoxygenation during a metabolic transition was identified in POST. Skeletal muscle citrate synthase activity was not different (P = 0.11) in POST (131 ± 16 nmol min-1 mg-1) vs. PRE (138 ± 19). Maximal ADP-stimulated mitochondrial respiration (66 ± 18 pmol s-1 mg-1 (POST) vs. 72 ± 14 (PRE), P = 0.41) was not affected by bed rest. Apparent K m for ADP sensitivity of mitochondrial respiration was reduced in POST vs. PRE (P = 0.04). The V˙O 2 m recovery time constant was not different (P = 0.79) in POST (22 ± 6 s) vs. PRE (22 ± 6). Resting V˙O 2 m was reduced by 25% in POST vs. PRE (P = 0.006). Microvascular-endothelial function was impaired following a 10-day bed rest, whereas mitochondrial mass and function (both in vivo and ex vivo) were unaffected or slightly enhanced. Abstract figure legend Potential sites of impairment of oxidative metabolism during exercise following microgravity-inactivity. Key points r Ten days of horizontal bed rest impaired in vivo oxidative function during exercise. r Microvascular impairments were identified by different methods. r Mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial function (evaluated both in vivo and ex vivo) were unchanged or even improved (i.e. enhanced mitochondrial sensitivity to submaximal [ADP]). r Resting muscle oxygen uptake was significantly lower following bed rest, suggesting that muscle catabolic processes induced by bed rest/inactivity are less energy-consuming than anabolic ones.},

abstract = {The “levodopa-overdose hypothesis” posits that dopaminergic replacement therapy (1) increases performance on tasks that depend on the nigrostriatal-pathway (e.g., motor-control circuits), yet (2) decreases performance on tasks that depend upon the mesocorticolimbic-pathway (e.g., prefrontal cortex, PFC). Previous work in Parkinson's disease (PD) investigated this model while focusing on cognitive function. Here, we evaluated whether this model applies to gait in patients with PD and freezing of gait (FOG). Forty participants were examined in both the OFF anti-Parkinsonian medication state (hypo-dopaminergic) and ON state (hyper-dopaminergic) while walking with and without the concurrent performance of a serial subtraction task. Wireless functional near-infrared spectroscopy measured PFC activation during walking. Consistent with the “overdose-hypothesis”, performance on the subtraction task decreased (p = 0.027) after dopamine intake. Moreover, the effect of walking condition on PFC activation depended on the dopaminergic state (i.e., interaction effect p = 0.001). Gait significantly improved after levodopa administration (p < 0.001). Nonetheless, PFC activation was higher (p = 0.013) in this state than in the OFF state during usual-walking. This increase in PFC activation in the ON state suggests that dopamine treatment interfered with PFC functioning. Otherwise, PFC activation, putatively a reflection of cognitive compensation, should have decreased. Moreover, in contrast to the OFF state, in the ON state, PFC activation failed to increase (p = 0.313) during dual-tasking, perhaps due to a “ceiling effect”. These findings extend the “levodopa-overdose hypothesis” and suggest that it also applies to gait in PD patients. While dopaminergic therapy improves certain aspects of motor performance, optimal treatment should consider the "double-edged sword" of levodopa.},

abstract = {Optimizing physical performance is a major goal in current physiology. However, basic understanding of combining high sprint and endurance performance is currently lacking. This study identifies critical determinants of combined sprint and endurance performance using multiple regression analyses of physiologic determinants at different biologic levels. Cyclists, including 6 international sprint, 8 team pursuit, and 14 road cyclists, completed a Wingate test and 15-km time trialto obtain sprint and endurance performance results, respectively. Performancewas normalized to lean body mass2/3 to eliminate the influence of body size. Performance determinants were obtained from whole-body oxygen consumption, blood sampling, knee-extensor maximal force, muscle oxygenation, whole-muscle morphology, and muscle fiber histochemistry of musculus vastus lateralis. Normalized sprint performance was explained by percentage of fast-type fibers and muscle volume (R2 = 0.65; P <0.001) and normalized endurance performance by performance oxygen consumption (Vo2), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and muscle oxygenation (R2 = 0.92; P < 0.001). Combined sprint and endurance performance was explained by gross efficiency, performance Vo2, and likely by muscle volume and fascicle length (P = 0.056; P = 0.059). High performance Vo2 related to a high oxidative capacity, high capillarization × myoglobin, and small physiologic cross-sectional area (R2 = 0.67; P < 0.001). Results suggest that fascicle length and capillarization are important targets for training to optimize sprint and endurance performance simultaneously.},

abstract = {It is uncommon for cardio-respiratory fitness and skeletal muscle metabolic function to be assessed independently within an exercise test. Exercise capacity may require adaptation of one or other of these systems to a greater or lesser extent and the presence of disease may affect them to different extents. The physiological mechanisms underpinning the decline in exercise tolerance with age/disease and the benefits of exercise-training as a preventative therapy for some diseases are not fully understood.In this thesis functional capacity was assessed in terms of oxidative capacity. Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) measures microvascular changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin and can be used to estimate oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle when combined with arterial occlusions. Oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle was determined as part of 3 studies; (1) in a group of older adults (>65 years old) with or without type 2 diabetes (T2D), (2) in a tri-ethnic group of older adults from the same cohort with the objective of determining ethnic difference in oxidative capacity independently of T2D and (3) in a group of young adults before and after a period of endurance training in preparation for their first marathon.NIRS measurements of muscle oxidative capacity revealed poorer function in older adults with diabetes (57.5±6.8 versus 38.7±2.6 s, p=0.02) and poorer oxidative capacity in South Asian older adults independently of T2D (difference (95%CI): 10.1 (2.3, 17.9) s, p=0.011). In young healthy men and women, skeletal muscle oxygen consumption post-exercise increased with endurance training (p < 0.01) despite no improvement in cardio-pulmonary peakV̇O2 (p=0.81). Faster marathon completion time correlated with cardio-pulmonary peakV̇O2 (rpartial=-0.55, p < 0.01) but not oxidative capacity.Skeletal muscle oxidative capacity can be measured in old and young adults using NIRS combined with arterial occlusion performed immediately following exercise testing. People with T2D have poorer oxidative capacity compared to people without and South Asians have poorer oxidative capacity compared to Europeans which African Caribbean's and Europeans had similar skeletal muscle oxidative capacity. Skeletal muscle metabolic adaptions occur following 6 months of endurance training. Although the cardio-pulmonary system is limiting for running performance, skeletal muscle changes can be detected despite no significant improvement in cardio-pulmonary function.},

abstract = {Introduction: Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with loss of motor control and difficulty exercising. This study measured skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity and endurance in individuals with and without PD using novel non-invasive methods. We hypothesized that individuals with PD will have decreased mitochondrial capacity, reduced oxygen recovery, and decreased endurance compared to controls. Methods: Eight participants with PD and nine healthy controls were tested. Mitochondrial capacity was measured as the rate of recovery of muscle metabolism after electrical stimulation using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and repeated short arterial occlusions. Oxygen recovery was measured as the half time of recovery of oxygen levels after 5 minutes of ischemia. Muscle endurance was determined from changes in twitch contraction acceleration during electrical stimulation at 2, 4, and 6 Hz. Results: Mitochondrial capacity was lower in individuals with PD compared to controls (1.5±0.1min-1 vs. 1.7±0.1min-1, p=0.02). Individuals with PD had slower oxygen recovery after ischemia compared to controls (8.9±2.3s vs. 5.4±0.8s, p=0.01). Endurance was not different between groups at 6 Hz (PD vs controls: 58±23% vs. 69±16%, p=0.34). The effect sizes for mitochondrial capacity and oxygen recovery were large (Cohen's d >0.8). The Cohen's d for endurance was 1.11. Conclusion: Individuals with PD had slight impairments in mitochondrial capacity and blood flow but did not have reduced muscle endurance. While our study suggests that muscle metabolic dysfunction may play a minor role in exercise intolerance in people with PD, it demonstrates the use of noninvasive technologies to evaluate muscle function in people with neurological disorders.},

abstract = {Previous studies of cognitive, mental and/or motor processes during short-, medium- and long-term weightlessness have only been descriptive in nature, and focused on psychological aspects. Until now, objective observation of neurophysiological parameters has not been carried out - undoubtedly because the technical and methodological means have not been available -, investigations into the neurophysiological effects of weightlessness are in their infancy (Schneider et al. 2008). While imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would be hardly applicable in space, the non-invasive near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technique represents a method of mapping hemodynamic processes in the brain in real time that is both relatively inexpensive and that can be employed even under extreme conditions. The combination with electroencephalography (EEG) opens up the possibility of following the electrocortical processes under changing gravity conditions with a finer temporal resolution as well as with deeper localization, for instance with electrotomography (LORETA). Previous studies showed an increase of beta frequency activity under normal gravity conditions and a decrease under weightlessness conditions during a parabolic flight (Schneider et al. 2008a+b). Tilt studies revealed different changes in brain function, which let suggest, that changes in parabolic flight might reflect emotional processes rather than hemodynamic changes. However, it is still unclear whether these are effects of changed gravity or hemodynamic changes within the brain. Combining EEG/LORETA and NIRS should for the first time make it possible to map the effect of weightlessness and reduced gravity on both hemodynamic and electrophysiological processes in the brain. Initially, this is to be done as part of a feasibility study during a parabolic flight. Afterwards, it is also planned to use both techniques during medium- and long-term space flight. It can be assumed that the long-term redistribution of the blood volume and the associated increase in the supply of oxygen to the brain will lead to changes in the central nervous system that are also responsible for anaemic processes, and which can in turn reduce performance (De Santo et al. 2005), which means that they could be crucial for the success and safety of a mission (Genik et al. 2005, Ellis 2000). Depending on these results, it will be necessary to develop and employ extensive countermeasures. Initial results for the MARS500 study suggest that, in addition to their significance in the context of the cardiovascular and locomotor systems, sport and physical activity can play a part in improving neurocognitive parameters. Before this can be fully established, however, it seems necessary to learn more about the influence of changing gravity conditions on neurophysiological processes and associated neurocognitive impairment. {\textcopyright} 2011 Journal of Visualized Experiments.},

abstract = {Bladder studies are the most recent biomedical application of NIRS in urology. Transcutaneous monitoring of the detrusor muscle in the bladder wall as the organ fills and empties offers new parameters for evaluation of normal and dysfunctional voiding. While established as a research entity clinical adoption requires comprehensive understanding of the attributes and limitations of the technique. We review key anatomic and physiologic elements that suit the bladder to study using NIRS. These include the depth and consistent relationship of the anterior wall below the abdominal skin which allow transcutaneous monitoring; the unique vascular anatomy which is central to normal organ function and maintenance of perfusion during the spatial changes that occur during bladder expansion and contraction; and the known association of various pathologies with adverse effects on the microcirculation and compromise of the contractile properties of the detrusor muscle. Such pathologies cause symptoms of voiding dysfunction which in many patients are due to disordered detrusor hemodynamics and/or an imbalance in oxygen supply and demand. Yet current clinical methodology for evaluating the underlying cause of voiding dysfunction only measures pressure and flow, and provides no information related to bladder hemodynamics or oxygenation. Monitoring data from prior studies that illustrate how NIRS of the bladder can contribute novel information related to the physiology of the bladder in health and disease are summarized. {\textcopyright} 2012 - IOS Press and the authors.},

abstract = {Purpose: Repeated-sprint training in hypoxia (RSH) was recently shown to improve repeated-sprint ability (RSA) in cycling. This phenomenon is likely to reflect fiber type-dependent, compensatory vasodilation, and therefore, our hypothesis was that RSH is even more beneficial for activities involving upper body muscles, such as double poling during cross-country skiing. Methods: In a double-blinded fashion, 17 competitive cross-country skiers performed six sessions of repeated sprints (each consisting of four sets of five 10-s sprints, with 20-s intervals of recovery) either in normoxia (RSN, 300 m; FiO2, 20.9%; n = 8) or normobaric hypoxia (RSH, 3000 m; FiO2, 13.8 %; n = 9). Before (pre) and after (post) training, performance was evaluated with an RSA test (10-s all-out sprints-20-s recovery, until peak power output declined by 30%) and a simulated team sprint (team sprint, 3×3-min all-out with 3-min rest) on a double-poling ergometer. Triceps brachii oxygenation was measured by near-infrared spectroscopy. Results: From pretraining to posttraining, peak power output in the RSA was increased (P < 0.01) to the same extent (29% ± 13% vs 26% ± 18%, nonsignificant) in RSH and in RSN whereas the number of sprints performed was enhanced in RSH (10.9 ± 5.2 vs 17.1 ± 6.8, P < 0.01) but not in RSN (11.6 T 5.3 vs 11.7 ± 4.3, nonsignificant). In addition, the amplitude in total hemoglobin variations during sprints throughout RSA rose more in RSH (P < 0.01). Similarly, the average power output during all team sprints improved by 11% T 9% in RSH and 15% T 7% in RSN. Conclusions: Our findings reveal greater improvement in the performance of repeated double-poling sprints, together with larger variations in the perfusion of upper body muscles in RSH compared with those in RSN.},

abstract = {Aim: Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) causes early onset of neuromuscular fatigue. Peripheral electrophysiological explorations suggest that supra-spinal alterations are involved through sensitive afferent pathways. As sensory input is projected over the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), S1 area involvement in inhibiting the central motor drive can be hypothesized. This study assessed cortical activity under a fatiguing NMES protocol at low frequency. Methods: Twenty healthy males performed five NMES sequences of 17 trains over the plantar flexors (30Hz, 4s on/6s off). Before and after each sequence, neuromuscular tests composed of maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) were carried out. Cortical activity was assessed during MVCs with functional near-infrared spectroscopy over S1 and primary motor (M1) areas, through oxy- [HbO] and deoxy-haemoglobin [HbR] variation. Electrophysiological data (H-reflex during MVC, EMG activity and level of voluntary activation) were also recorded. Results: MVC torque significantly decreased after the first 17 NMES trains (P<0.001). The electrophysiological data were consistent with supra-spinal alterations. In addition, [HbO] declined significantly during the protocol over the S1 and M1 areas from the first 17 NMES trains (P<0.01 and P<0.001 respectively), while [HbR] increased (P<0.05 and P<0.01 respectively), indicating early decline in cortical activity over both primary cortical areas. Conclusions: The declining cortical activity over the M1 area is highly consistent with the electrophysiological findings and supports motor cortex involvement in the loss of force after a fatiguing NMES protocol. In addition, the declining cortical activity over the S1 area indicates that the decreased motor output from M1 is not due to increased S1 inhibitory activity.},

abstract = {This study examined the effects of post-exercise cooling on recovery of neuromuscular, physiological, and cerebral hemodynamic responses after intermittent-sprint exercise in the heat. Nine participants underwent three post-exercise recovery trials, including a control (CONT), mixed-method cooling (MIX), and cold-water immersion (10°C; CWI). Voluntary force and activation were assessed simultaneously with cerebral oxygenation (near-infrared spectroscopy) pre- and post-exercise, post-intervention, and 1-h and 24-h post-exercise. Measures of heart rate, core temperature, skin temperature, muscle damage, and inflammation were also collected. Both cooling interventions reduced heart rate, core, and skin temperature post-intervention (P<0.05). CWI hastened the recovery of voluntary force by 12.7±11.7% (mean±SD) and 16.3±10.5% 1-h post-exercise compared to MIX and CONT, respectively (P<0.01). Voluntary force remained elevated by 16.1±20.5% 24-h post-exercise after CWI compared to CONT (P<0.05). Central activation was increased post-intervention and 1-h post-exercise with CWI compared to CONT (P<0.05), without differences between conditions 24-h post-exercise (P>0.05). CWI reduced cerebral oxygenation compared to MIX and CONT post-intervention (P<0.01). Furthermore, cooling interventions reduced cortisol 1-h post-exercise (P<0.01), although only CWI blunted creatine kinase 24-h post-exercise compared to CONT (P<0.05). Accordingly, improvements in neuromuscular recovery after post-exercise cooling appear to be disassociated with cerebral oxygenation, rather reflecting reductions in thermoregulatory demands to sustain force production. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

abstract = {Background: Torsion of the testis compromises blood flow through the spermatic cord; testicular ischemia results which if not diagnosed promptly and corrected surgically irrevocably damages the testis. Current diagnostic modalities aimed at rationalizing surgical exploration by demonstrating interruption of spermatic cord blood flow or testicular ischemia have limited applicability. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) offers a non-invasive optical method for detection of ischemia; continuous wave and frequency domain devices have been used experimentally; no device customized for clinical use has been designed. Methods: A miniature spatially resolved NIRS device with light emitting diode light source was applied over the right and left spermatic cord and the difference in oxygen saturation between the two sides measured. Results: In a 14-month old boy with a history of unilateral testicular pain color Doppler ultrasonography was equivocal but the NIRS-derived tissue oxygen saturation index (TSI) was significantly reduced on the left side. Confirmation of torsion of the left testicle was made surgically. Conclusions: Spatially resolved NIRS monitoring of spermatic cord oxygen saturation is feasible in children, adding to prior studies of testicular oxygen saturation in adults. Customized device design and further clinical trials would enhance the applicability of NIRS as a diagnostic entity for torsion. {\textcopyright} 2014 SPIE.},

abstract = {Context: Vapocoolant spray, commonly known as cold spray (CS), is a cryotherapy modality used in sports medicine, athletic training, and rehabilitation settings. Proposed physiologic effects of cryotherapy modalities include reductions in tissue blood flow, oxygenation, and cell metabolism in addition to attenuation of pain perception attributed to reduced superficial nerve conduction velocity. Objective: To examine the effects of CS on subcutaneous and intramuscular blood flow and oxygenation on the thigh muscle using near-infrared spectroscopy, an optical method to monitor changes in tissue oxygenated (O<inf>2</inf>Hb), deoxygenated (HHb), and total (tHb) hemoglobin. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Muscle Biophysics Laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: Participants were 13 healthy adults (8 men, 5 women; age=37.4 6 6 years, body mass index = 27.4 6 2.6, adipose tissue thickness = 7.2 6 1.8 mm). Intervention(s): Conventional CS was applied to the vastus medialis muscles. Main Outcome Measure(s): Changes in chromophore concentrations of O<inf>2</inf>Hb, HHb, and tHb at superficial and deep layers were monitored for 5 minutes using a 2-channel nearinfrared spectroscopy. Results: Thirty seconds after CS application, we observed a decrease from baseline in O<inf>2</inf>Hb and tHb only in the superficial layer that was maintained for 3 minutes. Conclusions: Application of CS induced a transient change in blood flow and oxygenation of the superficial tissues with no change in deeper tissues over the healthy vastus medialis muscle. The limited physiologic effect of CS on the superficial hemodynamics and oxygenation of limb muscles may limit the therapeutic benefit of this cryotherapy modality to a temporary analgesic effect, a hypothesis that warrants a clinical trial on traumatized muscles.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to test how low-frequency electrical stimulation (LFES; Veinoplus Sport (AdRem Technology, Paris, France)) of the calf muscles affects recovery indices compared with 2 other commonly used recovery methods (active, ACT; passive, PAS). The tests used assessed predominantly anaerobic performance after short-term (15 min) recovery, and the kinetics of blood markers. Fourteen highly trained female handball players completed 2 Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery tests (level 2; YYIR2) separated by a 15-min recovery period. During recovery, 1 of 3 recovery methods (ACT, LFES or PAS) was randomly selected. Performance (i.e., distance run) was measured at the end of each YYIR2 test. Blood lactate, pH, bicarbonate concentrations, heart rate, respiratory gas exchange and tissue saturation index for the lateral gastrocnemius were recorded. LFES showed a very likely beneficial effect on performance during the second YYIR2 relative to PAS and a possible beneficial effect relative to ACT (distance Pre vs. Post; LFES: -1.8%; ACT: -7.6%; PAS: -15.9%). Compared with PAS recovery, LFES and ACT recovery clearly showed a faster return to baseline for blood lactate, pH and bicarbonate concentrations during the recovery period. LFES of the calf muscles and, to a lesser extent, ACT recovery appear to effectively improve short-term recovery between 2 bouts of exhausting exercises. These methods could be of benefit if applied during half-time, for sports involving successive rounds, or where only a limited recovery period is available.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate how the interrelationships between low-frequency oscillations (LFOs) in the cerebral and systemic cardiovascular hemodynamic systems change with aging and systemic hemodynamic perturbation. Seventeen young adult (28.4 ± 3.5. years) and seventeen elderly subjects (69.4 ± 8.7. years) underwent continuous measurements of arterial blood pressure (ABP), heart rate (HR), and cerebral oxygenation (oxy-hemoglobin, deoxy-hemoglobin, and total hemoglobin) using near-infrared spectroscopy. The LFOs were subdivided into three frequency intervals (FI-1: 0.01-0.02. Hz, FI-2: 0.02-0.06. Hz, and FI-3: 0.06-0.15. Hz) via spectral analysis based on continuous wavelet transform. The amplitudes of the LFOs at these FIs were calculated to examine the effects of aging and head-up tilt (HUT) on cerebral and cardiovascular hemodynamics. Granger causality (GC) was used for analyzing the causal relationships between the LFOs observed in ABP, oxy-hemoglobin, and HR. The amplitudes of the LFOs were generally higher in young adults than in the elderly and increased significantly only in the younger subjects after HUT. GCs in FI-3 oscillations were significantly higher in young subjects compared to older participants in the HUT state. These results indicate that aging dampens systemic and cerebral hemodynamic regulatory mechanisms, and the interrelationships between systemic and cerebral hemodynamics become weaker with age.},

abstract = {The presence of hypertension in middle-age is a major risk factor for later-life development of cognitive and cardiovascular disease. Exercise is widely recommended to combat vascular and brain aging in hypertension. We sought to compare the effects of a single bout of aerobic exercise on 1) arterial stiffness and cerebral hemodynamics and 2) cognitive function in middle-aged adults with controlled-hypertension and without hypertension. Vascular and cognitive measures were assessed pre and post 30-min of aerobic exercise at ≈55% maximal oxygen consumption. Arterial stiffness and cerebral hemodynamics were measured non-invasively. Cognitive function was measured using a computerized testing battery that included executive function and memory tasks. Acute aerobic exercise resulted in similar 1) increases in arterial stiffness and cerebral hemodynamic pulsatility, and 2) accelerated executive function and memory reaction time post-exercise in adults with and without hypertension. Based on these results, we investigated if adults with hypertension had differential vascular contributions to cognitive activity. We measured cerebrovascular hemodynamics non-invasively during cognitive activity as a measure of neurovascular coupling. Adults with and without hypertension exhibit similar increases in large artery stiffness and decreases in extracranial hemodynamic pulsatility during cognitive activity, indicating similar neurovascular coupling between groups. In conclusion, these data indicate that middle-aged adults with controlled-hypertension experience similar 1) vascular responses to acute exercise and cognitive activity, and 2) beneficial changes in cognitive function following acute exercise as their counterparts without hypertension. Our results will be interpreted and explored in the context of hypertension severity and underscore the importance of optimal blood pressure control.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to assess the reliability of postexercise near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-derived measurements and their sensitivity to different exercise intensities in the field. Seventeen athletes (24{\textperiodcentered}1±5{\textperiodcentered}6year) repeated, on three occasions, two 2-min submaximal shuttle-runs at 40% and 60% of V IFT (final speed of the 30-15 intermittent fitness test) and a 50-m shuttle-run sprint (Sprint), with (OCC) or without (CON) repeated transient arterial occlusions of the medial gastrocnemius during the postexercise period. NIRS variables (i.e. oxyhaemoglobin [HbO 2], deoxyhaemoglobin [HHb] and their difference [Hb diff]) were measured continuously for 3min after each exercise. Half-recovery (1/2Rec) and mean response (MRT; monoexponential curve fitting) times of muscle reoxygenation and muscle oxygen uptake recovery were calculated. Reliability was assessed using the typical error of measurement, expressed as a coefficient of variation (CV). Postexercise recovery of muscle reoxygenation revealed CVs ranging from 16{\textperiodcentered}8% to 37{\textperiodcentered}3%; CV for recovery ranged from 6{\textperiodcentered}2% to 20{\textperiodcentered}9%, with no substantial differences shown between NIRS variables and exercise intensities. While running, intensity did not affect MRT or 1/2Rec for muscle reoxygenation, and differences were found for recovery (e.g. [Hb diff]- MRT=28{\textperiodcentered}7±5{\textperiodcentered}2, 34{\textperiodcentered}2±5{\textperiodcentered}1 and 37{\textperiodcentered}3±6{\textperiodcentered}2s for 40%, 60% and Sprint, respectively, P<0{\textperiodcentered}01). To conclude, the kinetics of postexercise NIRS measurements showed CV values ranging from 6% to 37%, with no substantial differences between exercise intensities or NIRS-derived variables.

abstract = {Radiographic cerebral vasospasm (CVS) after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) do not reflect cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation and may occur in the absence of clinical deficit and vice-versa. This report is to describe preliminary findings in further development of a non invasive method to estimate regional cerebral oxygenation and perfusion. Measurements were performed with a technique combining near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and indocyaningreen (ICG) dye dilution. Successful data analysis has been performed based on the decomposition in pulsatile and non-pulsatile components of NIRS absorption data collected before and during the passage of ICG through the vascular bed under the NIRS-detector. First measurements in patients with CVS suggest that the technique could become a powerful tool in the detection and treatment of CVS. This non invasive technique can be done at the bedside, it seems to be safe, easy to perform and less time-consuming compared to conventional techniques. The influence of extracerebral bone and surface tissue on cerebral NIRS signal has not been clarified yet. Therefore a new subdural NIRS probe has been developed, which gives the opportunity to measure directly the concentration of the chromophores in the brain without the influence of extracerebral contamination. In future comparative measurements with conventional NIRS probes on the scalp will allow to quantify and eliminate extracerebral contamination from the NIRS signal. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2002.},

abstract = {It is well-known that stress affects sleep quality, suggesting abnormal brain activity during sleep when people are stressed. However, no study has examined where brain processes stress during sleep. This study aims to explore the associations between bedtime stress and the hemodynamics in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during the first sleep cycle under free-living conditions. Stress biomarkers including salivary cortisol and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) were measured using the SOMA Dual Analyte LFD test kits on the experiment nights between 22:00-23:00 to control the circadian oscillation of the stress-related hormones. Perceived stress level was rated on a 1-10 Likert scale right after the collection of the salivary samples. The hemodynamics of the pre-frontal cortex (PFC) was measured using a wearable functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) device. Correlation analysis with statistical test was performed to examine the associations between different stress indicators and a set of time-domain and frequency-domain features derived from the hemodynamic responses. Significantly positive linear correlations were observed in the standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis between the average concentration change of oxyhemoglobin and that of deoxyhemoglobin in the whole region of interest. Stress was found to correlate to the hemodynamics in the mid-DLPFC, the caudal-DLPFC, and the left RLPFC. The relationships between stress and these PFC subregions depends on the stress indicator adopted. Our finding provides supplementary support to the role of the PFC in processing stress. The preliminary results also shed light on the development of stress response markers in brain activity that can be measured with wearable brain-computer interface technologies.},

abstract = {This study aims to assess the vigilance task-related change in connectivity in healthy adults using wavelet phase coherence (WPCO) analysis of near-infrared spectroscopy signals (NIRS). NIRS is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique for assessing brain activity. Continuous recordings of the NIRS signals were obtained from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and sensorimotor cortical areas of 20 young healthy adults (24.9 ± 3.3 years) during a 10-min resting state and a 20-min vigilance task state. The vigilance task was used to simulate driving mental load by judging three random numbers (i.e., whether odd numbers). The task was divided into two sessions: the first 10 min (Task t1) and the second 10 min (Task t2). The WPCO of six channel pairs were calculated in five frequency intervals: 0.6-2 Hz (I), 0.145-0.6 Hz (II), 0.052-0.145 Hz (III), 0.021-0.052 Hz (IV), and 0.0095-0.021 Hz (V). The significant WPCO formed global connectivity (GC) maps in intervals I and II and functional connectivity (FC) maps in intervals III to V. Results show that the GC levels in interval I and FC levels in interval III were significantly lower in the Task t2 than in the resting state (p < 0.05), particularly between the left PFC and bilateral sensorimotor regions. Also, the reaction time (RT) shows an increase in Task t2 compared with that in Task t1. However, no significant difference in WPCO was found between Task t1 and resting state. The results showed that the change in FC at the range of 0.6-2 Hz was not attributed to the vigilance task per se, but the interaction effect of vigilance task and time factors. The findings suggest that the decreased attention level might be partly attributed to the reduced GC levels between the left prefrontal region and sensorimotor area. The present results provide a new insight into the vigilance task-related brain activity.},

abstract = {Previous studies have suggested that a reduction in cerebral oxygen delivery may limit motor drive, particularly in hypoxic conditions, where oxygen transport is impaired. We hypothesized that raising end-tidal PCO 2 (PETCO 2) during incremental exercise would increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen delivery, thereby improving peak power output (W peak). Amateur cyclists performed two ramped exercise tests (25 W/min) in a counterbalanced order to compare the normal, poikilocapnic response against a clamped condition, in which PETCO 2 was held at 50 Torr throughout exercise. Tests were performed in normoxia (barometric pressure = 630 mmHg, 1,650 m) and hypoxia (barometric pressure = 425 mmHg, 4,875 m) in a hypobaric chamber. An additional trial in hypoxia investigated effects of clamping at a lower PETCO 2 (40 Torr) from ∼75 to 100% W peak to reduce potential influences of respiratory acidosis and muscle fatigue imposed by clamping PETCO 2 at 50 Torr. Metabolic gases, ventilation, middle cerebral artery CBF velocity (transcranial Doppler), forehead pulse oximetry, and cerebral (prefrontal) and muscle (vastus lateralis) hemoglobin oxygenation (near infrared spectroscopy) were monitored across trials. Clamping PETCO 2 at 50 Torr in both normoxia (n = 9) and hypoxia (n = 11) elevated CBF velocity (∼40%) and improved cerebral hemoglobin oxygenation (∼15%), but decreased W peak (6%) and peak oxygen consumption (11%). Clamping at 40 Torr near maximal effort in hypoxia (n = 6) also improved cerebral oxygenation (∼15%), but again limited W peak (5%). These findings demonstrate that increasing mass cerebral oxygen delivery via CO 2-mediated vasodilation does not improve incremental exercise performance, at least when accompanied by respiratory acidosis.

Although measurement of local oxygenation by NIRS has been used for the diagnosis of metabolic myopathies, the technique has not previously been applied to inflammatory myopathies. Dermatomyositis is a muscle disorder characterised by complement mediated capillary necrosis, resulting in ischaemia and hypoperfusion. We have now employed NIRS to study the effect of corticosteroid treatment on haemodynamics in muscle tissue in dermatomyositis. The pathological features of dermatomyositis are characterised by a decreased number of capillaries per muscle fibre and necrosis of single muscle fibres or clusters of fibres at the periphery of the fasciculi.1 Muscle fibre regeneration and an increased number of capillaries have been shown in dermatomyositis after intravenous immune globulin treatment,2 but corticosteroids are still considered to be the first line of therapy. In the clinical setting, the effect of treatment is mainly assessed by muscle strength and creatine kinase (CK) levels. Direct measurement of capillary and muscle fibre status can only be done by repeated muscle biopsies. However, apart from the fact that muscle biopsies are invasive, they are also a static representation of muscle tissue at a fixed time point and at a particular location (selection bias).},

abstract = {New Findings: What is the central question of this study? Exercise performance is limited during hypoxia by a critical reduction in cerebral and skeletal tissue oxygenation. To what extent an elevation in systemic free radical accumulation contributes to microvascular deoxygenation and the corresponding reduction in maximal aerobic capacity remains unknown. What is the main finding and its importance? We show that altered free radical metabolism is not a limiting factor for exercise performance in hypoxia, providing important insight into the fundamental mechanisms involved in the control of vascular oxygen transport. Exercise performance in hypoxia may be limited by a critical reduction in cerebral and skeletal tissue oxygenation, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We examined whether increased systemic free radical accumulation during hypoxia would be associated with elevated microvascular deoxygenation and reduced maximal aerobic capacity (V˙O2 max ). Eleven healthy men were randomly assigned single-blind to an incremental semi-recumbent cycling test to determine V˙O2 max in both normoxia (21% O2) and hypoxia (12% O2) separated by a week. Continuous-wave near-infrared spectroscopy was employed to monitor concentration changes in oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin in the left vastus lateralis muscle and frontal cerebral cortex. Antecubital venous blood samples were obtained at rest and at V˙O2 max to determine oxidative (ascorbate radical by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy), nitrosative (nitric oxide metabolites by ozone-based chemiluminescence and 3-nitrotyrosine by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and inflammatory stress biomarkers (soluble intercellular/vascular cell adhesion 1 molecules by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Hypoxia was associated with increased cerebral and muscle tissue deoxygenation and lower V˙O2 max (P < 0.05 versus normoxia). Despite an exercise-induced increase in oxidative-nitrosative-inflammatory stress, hypoxia per se did not have an additive effect (P > 0.05 versus normoxia). Consequently, we failed to observe correlations between any metabolic, haemodynamic and cardiorespiratory parameters (P > 0.05). Collectively, these findings suggest that altered free radical metabolism cannot explain the elevated microvascular deoxygenation and corresponding lower V˙O2 max in hypoxia. Further research is required to determine whether free radicals when present in excess do indeed contribute to the premature termination of exercise in hypoxia.},

abstract = {Background: Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been used to measure oxidative capacity, but regional differences have not been identified. Piano players are also a novel group of subjects for this lab. Methods: Controls (n = 13) and piano players (n = 8) were tested in a seated position on the right forearm. A fatigue test was performed for three minutes at 2, 4 and 6 Hz using electrical stimulation, which created an endurance index (EI) as the forearm fatigued. A six-cuff oxidative capacity test was performed using manual exercise to activate the muscle and allow for regional specificity. A rate constant (Rc) was generated from the mitochondrial capacity data. Results: Overall, piano players (Rc = 1.76 ± 0.6) and controls (Rc = 1.17 ± 0.3) have significant differences for the last two fingers (p = 0.01). While controls have significant differences between the index (Rc = 1.86 ± 0.5) and last two fingers (Rc = 1.17 ± 0.3) (p = 0.001), this difference was not observed in piano players. Overall, piano players (EI = 75.7 ± 12.3) and controls (EI = 73.0 ± 17.3) had no differences in endurance index values (p = 0.71). Conclusions: Piano players have significant differences in the mitochondrial capacity of the finger flexors that control the last two fingers compared to controls. The lack of difference between groups in the index fingers and overall endurance test suggests playing the piano produces training adaptations to the finger flexor muscles of the last two digits, which are rarely used by control subjects.},

However, it remains unclear if dopaminergic medication modulates cortical activity while walking.ObjectiveWe investigated the effects of dopaminergic medication on cortical activity during unobstructed walking and obstacle avoidance in people with PD.MethodsA total of 23 individuals with PD, in both off (PDOFF) and on (PDON) medication states, and 30 healthy older adults (control group [CG]) performed unobstructed walking and obstacle avoidance conditions. Cortical activity was acquired through a combined functional near-infrared spectroscopy electroencephalography (EEG) system, along with gait parameters, through an electronic carpet. Prefrontal cortex (PFC) oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) and EEG absolute power from FCz, Cz, and CPz channels were calculated.ResultsHbO2 concentration reduced for people with PDOFF during obstacle avoidance compared with unobstructed walking. In contrast, both people with PDON and the CG had increased HbO2 concentration when avoiding obstacles compared with unobstructed walking. Dopaminergic medication increased step length, step velocity, and $\beta$ and $\gamma$ power in the CPz channel, regardless of walking condition. Moreover, dopaminergic-related changes (ie, on-off) in FCz/CPz $\gamma$ power were associated with dopaminergic-related changes in step length for both walking conditions.ConclusionsPD compromises the activation of the PFC during obstacle avoidance, and dopaminergic medication facilitates its recruitment. In addition, PD medication increases sensorimotor integration during walking by increasing posterior parietal cortex (CPz) activity. Increased $\gamma$ power in the CPz and FCz channels is correlated with step length improvements achieved with dopaminergic medication during unobstructed walking and obstacle avoidance in PD.},

abstract = {Subcortical vascular dementia (SVD) is a form of vascular dementia from small vessel disease with white matter lesions and lacunes. We hypothesized that hemodynamic and metabolic changes in the cortex during a simple motor task may reflect the impaired neurovascular coupling in SVD. We used fMRI and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) simultaneously, which together provided multiple hemodynamic responses as well as a robust estimation of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2). During the task periods, the oxy-hemoglobin, total-hemoglobin, blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and CMRO2 decreased statistically significantly in the primary motor and somatosensory cortices of SVD patients, whereas the oxygen extraction fraction increased when compared with controls. Notably, the flow-metabolism coupling ratio, n representing the ratio of oxygen supply to its utilization, showed a robust reduction in the SVD patient group (nControl=1.99±0.23; nSVD=1.08±0.24), which implies a loss of metabolic reserve. These results support the pathological small vessel compromise, including an increased vessel stiffness, impaired vascular reactivity, and impaired neurovascular coupling in SVD. In conclusion, simultaneous measurement by NIRS and fMRI can reveal various hemodynamic and metabolic changes and may be used for as an early detection or monitoring of SVD. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Upon stimulation, real time maps of cortical hemodynamic responses can be obtained by non-invasive functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) which measures changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin after positioning multiple sources and detectors over the human scalp. The current commercially available transportable fNIRS systems have a time resolution of 1-10. Hz, a depth sensitivity of about 1.5. cm, and a spatial resolution of about 1. cm. The goal of this brief review is to report infants, children and adults fNIRS language studies. Since 1998, 60 studies have been published on cortical activation in the brain's classic language areas in children/adults as well as newborns using fNIRS instrumentations of different complexity. In addition, the basic principles of fNIRS including features, strengths, advantages, and limitations are summarized in terms that can be understood even by non specialists. Future prospects of fNIRS in the field of language processing imaging are highlighted. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Muscle deoxygenation responses provide information about the training impulse of an exercise session enabling adaptation to be predicted. Our aim was to investigate muscle oxygenation profiles during prolonged low-intensity eccentric and concentric cycling. Twelve healthy men performed two 45-min exercise sessions of concentric (CON) and eccentric (ECC) cycling, matched for the same heart rate at the start of each session. Mechanical power output during ECC was ∼2.5 times that of CON (210±40 W vs. 82±16 W). Oxygen uptake, blood lactate, cardiac output and systolic arterial pressure responses did not differ between exercises. Heart rate was similar at 5 min of each exercise bout but progressively increased during ECC and was higher at 15, 30 and 45 min of ECC compared to CON (+10 bpm), with a trend for a lower stroke volume. Diastolic and mean blood pressures were higher during ECC. No significant differences were observed in muscle oxygenation profiles. Muscle oxygenation responses during prolonged low-intensity exercise were not affected by the type of muscle action at the same metabolic demand and cardiac output.},

abstract = {Hypertension even when controlled, may accelerate arterial stiffening and impair the ability of the cerebrovasculature to increase blood flow to support neural activity, i.e., neurovascular coupling (NVC). Optimal NVC depends on continuous, nonpulsatile flow, which is partially determined by extra- and intracranial vessel function. We sought to compare extra- and intracranial hemodynamics during cognitive activity (Stroop task) in 30 middle-aged, well-controlled medicated hypertensive and 30 age-, sex-, and body mass index (BMI)-matched nonhypertensive adults (56 6 years, 28.2 2.9 kg/m 2 BMI; 32 men). Aortic and carotid (single point) pulse wave velocity (PWV) were assessed via tonometry and ultrasound, respectively. Carotid and middle cerebral artery (MCA) blood velocity pulsatility were measured via ultrasound and Doppler. Prefrontal cortex (PFC) oxygenation was measured via tissue saturation index (TSI) using near-infrared spectroscopy. Accuracy and reaction times were computed to assess cognitive performance. Stroop performance was similar between groups (P 0.01). Aortic and carotid PWV increased, carotid flow pulsatility decreased (P 0.01), and MCA flow pulsatility and PFC TSI were maintained during Stroop (P 0.01). Our findings indicate that middle-age adults with medically controlled hypertension and adults without hypertension demonstrate similar intra- and extracranial cerebrovascular reactivity during cognitive engagement. Despite increases in large artery stiffness, middle-aged adults with controlled hypertension and without hypertension exhibit reductions in extracranial flow pulsatility during cognitive engagement that may be part of a concerted cerebrovascular response to support downstream cerebral oxygenation and overall NVC. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Hypertension is associated with accelerated arterial stiffening, which may alter extra- and intracranial vascular reactivity during cognitive activity and impair neurovascular coupling. Middle-aged adults with medicated hypertension exhibit similar neurovascular coupling and extra-/intracranial vascular reactivity during sustained cognitive activity. Extracranial modulation of central hemodynamics may be an important component of optimal neurovascular coupling.},

abstract = {Increased local blood supply is thought to be one of the mechanisms underlying oxidative adaptations to interval training regimes. The relationship of exercise intensity with local blood supply and oxygen availability has not been sufficiently evaluated yet. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of six different intensities (40–90% peak oxygen uptake, VO2peak) on relative changes in oxygenated, deoxygenated and total haemoglobin ($\Delta$O2Hb, $\Delta$HHb, $\Delta$THb) concentration after exercise as well as end-exercise $\Delta$HHb/$\Delta$VO2 as a marker for microvascular O2 distribution. Seventeen male subjects performed an experimental protocol consisting of 3 min cycling bouts at each exercise intensity in randomized order, separated by 5 min rests. $\Delta$O2Hb and $\Delta$HHb were monitored with near-infrared spectroscopy of the vastus lateralis muscle, and VO2 was assessed. $\Delta$HHb/$\Delta$VO2 increased significantly from 40% to 60% VO2peak and decreased from 60% to 90% VO2peak. Post-exercise $\Delta$THb and $\Delta$O2Hb showed an overshoot in relation to pre-exercise values, which was equal after 40–60% VO2peak and rose significantly thereafter. A plateau was reached following exercise at ≥80% VO2peak. The results suggest that there is an increasing mismatch of local O2 delivery and utilization during exercise up to 60% VO2peak. This insufficient local O2 distribution is progressively improved above that intensity. Further, exercise intensities of ≥80% VO2peak induce highest local post-exercise O2 availability. These effects are likely due to improved microvascular perfusion by enhanced vasodilation, which could be mediated by higher lactate production and the accompanying acidosis.},

abstract = {This study was designed to determine whether trunk extensor fatigue occurs during low-level activity and whether this is associated with a drop in muscle tissue oxygenation. Electromyography (EMG) feedback was used to impose constant activity in a part of the trunk extensor muscles. We hypothesized that electromyographic manifestations of fatigue and decreased oxygenation would be observed at the feedback site and that EMG activity at other sites would be more variable without fatigue manifestations. Twelve volunteers performed 30-min contractions at 2% and 5% of the maximum EMG amplitude (EMGmax) at the feedback site. EMG was recorded from six sites over the lumbar extensor muscles and near-infrared spectroscopy was used to measure changes in oxygenation at the feedback site (left L3 level, 3 cm paravertebral). In both conditions, mean EMG activity was not significantly different between electrode sites, whereas the coefficient of variation was lower at the feedback site compared to other recording sites. The EMG mean power frequency (MPF) decreased consistently at the feedback site only. At 5% EMGmax, the decrease in MPF was significant at the group level at all sites ipsilateral to the feedback site. These results suggest that the limited variability of muscle activity at the EMG feedback site and at ipsilateral locations enhances fatigue development. No decreases in tissue oxygenation were detected. In conclusion, even at mean activity levels as low as 2% EMGmax, fatigue manifestations were found in the trunk extensors. These occured in absence of changes in oxygenation of the muscle tissue. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{jung_activation_2015,
abstract = {Recent studies postulated that increased oxygenation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during elevating exercise intensities reflects a specific activation of this region. Furthermore, the drop in PFC oxygenation often measured shortly before exhaustion is interpreted as a main factor limiting exercise. Nevertheless, a limitation of these studies is that they often measured NIRS only in the PFC. Within this study, we hypothesized that these findings are not region specific but rather result from systemic blood redistribution to the working skeletal muscle. NIRS was measured in three different brain regions and the working skeletal muscle during incremental cycling till exhaustion in nine healthy men. Oxygenated hemoglobin of the PFC increased from low to submaximal intensities and leveled off at maximal intensities. There was no drop in PFC oxygenation before exercise abortion. Interestingly, the occipital cortex was unaffected during exercise, while the motor cortex showed an increasing deoxygenation with elevating exercise intensities, just as observed in the skeletal muscle. In conclusion, this study does not support the notion that PFC deoxygenation is involved in the limitation of maximum exercise capacity. Against the hypothesis, the NIRS signals of the other cortices differed clearly, indicating that the previously reported findings indeed represent region-specific activations.},

abstract = {Study Objectives Sleep is altered at high altitude leading many mountaineers to use hypnotics in order to improve sleep efficiency. While after a full night at altitude the short-acting hypnotic zolpidem does not appear to alter cognitive function, residual adverse effects should be considered following early waking-up as performed by mountaineers. We hypothesized that zolpidem intake at high altitude would alter cognitive function 4 hours after drug intake. Methods In a randomized double-blind controlled cross-over study, 22 participants were evaluated during two nights at sea level and two nights at 3800 m, 4 hours after zolpidem (10 mg) or placebo intake at 10:00 pm. Polygraphic recording was performed until waking-up at 01:30 am. Sleep quality, sleepiness and symptoms of acute mountain sickness were assessed by questionnaires. Two cognitive tasks (Simon task and duration-production task) were performed at rest and during exercise and postural control was evaluated. Results Zolpidem increased reaction time in all conditions (zolpidem 407 ± 9 ms vs. placebo 380 ± 11 ms; p < 0.001) and error rate in incongruent trials only (10.2 ± 1.1% vs. 7.8 ± 0.8%; p < 0.01) in the Simon task and increased time perception variability (p < 0.001). Zolpidem also altered postural parameters (e.g. center of pressure area, zolpidem 236 ± 171.5 mm 2 vs. placebo 119.6 ± 59 mm 2; p < 0.001). Zolpidem did not affect apnea-hypopnea index and mean arterial oxygen saturation (p > 0.05) but increased sleep quality (p < 0.001). Zolpidem increased symptoms of acute mountain sickness and sleepiness (p < 0.05). Conclusions Acute zolpidem intake at high altitude alters cognitive functions and postural control during early wakening which may be deleterious for safety and performances of climbers.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare muscle oxygenation of the vastus lateralis during a high-volume isokinetic resistance exercise protocol (HVP) between young adult (YA) and middle-aged adult (MA) men. Twenty recreationally trained men were assigned to either the YA (age 21.8±2.0 years, body mass 90.7±11.6 kg, body height 179±4.7 cm) or MA (age 47.0±4.4 years, body mass 96.1±21.6 kg, body height 177±7.7 cm) group. The HVP consisted of eight sets of 10 repetitions of unilateral isokinetic concentric knee extension and eccentric knee flexion at 60°{\textperiodcentered}s-1. Changes in tissue hemoglobin saturation index (TSI), tissue oxygenated hemoglobin concentration (O2Hb), deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb), and muscle oxidation index (O2Hb-HHb) were measured during the exercise session using the near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Data were analyzed using two-way mix factorial analyses of variance. Prior to exercise, TSI was significantly greater (p=.024) for YA compared to MA. Significant decreases in O2Hb and O2Hb-HHb and increases in HHb were observed during each of the eight sets relative to the rest periods (p<.05) for both groups. The average change during the eight sets of the HVP revealed a significantly higher (p=.036) level of HHb and a lower (p=.029) level of O2Hb-HHb for MA compared to YA. A significant negative correlation was also noted at baseline between O2Hb-HHb index and the cross-sectional area of the vastus lateralis muscle (r=-.45, p=.045). During a highvolume resistance exercise, MA experienced reduced muscle oxygen saturation levels compared to YA. These results may be attributed to reductions in local tissue oxidative capacity and reduced blood delivery occurring during middle-age, and possibly due to group differences in muscle morphology.},

Patients with unilateral stenosis 70% according to North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) were included. Hemodynamic relevance was assessed using ultrasound criteria. Transcranial spectroscopy recordings were taken before and after surgical or interventional treatment of the stenosis. Optodes were placed bilaterally on the intact frontoparietal aspect of the skull. Oxygen saturation and diversion angle alpha from the hemoglobin plane were measured. There were no significant differences regarding arterial oxygen saturation between the two groups. Oxygen saturation ranged from 0.910 ± 0.08 to 0.957 ± 0.028 in the subgroups (all values asmean± S.E.). These values are consistent with previous studies and theoretical values. In smokers we found a significantly shifted diversion angle from the hemoglobin plane to the negative side. This indicates the presence of an absorber other than oxy- and desoxyhemoglobin in the optical field. Weconclude that transcranial pulse oximetry cannot distinguish between patients with hemodynamically relevant and irrelevant stenosis of the internal carotid artery. However it seems to be capable of distinguishing smokers from non-smokers. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare the muscle oxygenation between trained and untrained subjects during heavy exercise until exhaustion at two extreme pedaling cadences using a NIRS system. Methods: Nine untrained male subjects and nine male competitive triathletes cycled until exhaustion at an intensity corresponding to 90 % of the power output achieved at peak oxygen uptake at 40 and 100 rpm. Gas exchanges were measured breath-by-breath during each exercise. Muscle (de)oxygenation was monitored continuously by near-infrared spectroscopy on the Vastus Lateralis. Results: Muscle deoxygenation (∆deoxy[Hb + Mb], i.e., O2 extraction) and ∆total[Hb + Mb] were significantly higher at 40 rpm compared to 100 rpm during the exercise in untrained subjects but not in triathletes (p < 0.05). The time performed until exhaustion was significantly higher at 40 than at 100 rpm in untrained subjects (373 ± 55 vs. 234 ± 37 s, respectively) but not in triathletes (339 ± 69 vs. 325 ± 66 s). Conclusions: These results indicate that high aerobic fitness (1) allows for better regulation between V˙O2M and Q˙O2M following the change in pedaling cadence, and (2) is the most important factor in the relationship between pedaling cadence and performance.},

abstract = {To establish the test–retest reliability of pulmonary oxygen uptake (V̇O2), muscle deoxygenation (deoxy[haem]) and tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) kinetics in youth elite-cyclists. From baseline pedalling, 15 youth cyclists completed 6-min step transitions to a moderate- and heavy-intensity work rate separated by 8 min of baseline cycling. The protocol was repeated after 1 h of passive rest. V̇O2 was measured breath-by-breath alongside deoxy[haem] and StO2 of the vastus lateralis by near-infrared spectroscopy. Reliability was assessed using 95% limits of agreement (LoA), the typical error (TE) and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). During moderate- and heavy-intensity step cycling, TEs for the amplitude, time delay and time constant ranged between 3.5–21.9% and 3.9–12.1% for V̇O2 and between 6.6–13.7% and 3.5–10.4% for deoxy[haem], respectively. The 95% confidence interval for estimating the kinetic parameters significantly improved for ensemble-averaged transitions of V̇O2 (p < 0.01) but not for deoxy[haem]. For StO2, the TEs for the baseline, end-exercise and the rate of deoxygenation were 1.0–42.5% and 1.1–5.5% during moderate- and heavy-intensity exercise, respectively. The ICC ranged from 0.81 to 0.99 for all measures. Test–retest reliability data provide limits within which changes in V̇O2, deoxy[haem] and StO2 kinetics may be interpreted with confidence in youth athletes.},

On the other hand, in RSH-VHL, cerebral oxygenation was significantly lower than in RSN (-6.1±5.4 vs-1.5±6.6 $\mu$m). Oxygen uptake was also higher during the recovery periods whereas [La] max tended to be lower in RSH-VHL. The time of the sprints was not different between conditions. This study shows that repeated shuttle-run sprints with VHL has a limited impact on muscle deoxygenation but induces a greater fall in cerebral oxygenation compared with normal breathing conditions. Despite this phenomenon, performance is not impaired, probably because of a higher oxygen uptake during the recovery periods following sprints.},

abstract = {Oxygen uptake (V? O2) kinetics are prolonged in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). This may be caused by impaired oxygen delivery or skeletal muscle derangements. We investigated whether impaired cardiac output (Q? ) kinetics limit skeletal muscle oxygen delivery relative to the metabolic demands at submaximal exercise in CHF patients by evaluating the relation between Q ? kinetics and skeletal muscle deoxygenation. Forty-three CHF patients, NYHA II-III, performed a constant-load exercise test at 80% of the ventilatory aerobic threshold (VAT) to assessV ? O2 kinetics (V ? O2). Q ? kinetics (Q ? ) were assessed by a radial artery pulse contour analysis method. Skeletal muscle deoxygenation was assessed by near infrared spectroscopy at the m. vastus lateralis, using the minimal value of the tissue saturation index during onset of exercise (TSImin). Patients were categorized in slow and normal Q ? responders relative to metabolic demands (Q ? /V? O2 1 and Q ? /V? O2 1, respectively), Q ? (62 29 s), and V ? O2 (60 21 s) were significantly related (r 0.66, P 0.001). There was a significant correlation between Q ? and TSImin in the slow Q ? responders [rs-0.57, P 0.005, n 22 (51%)]. In conclusion, in moderately impaired CHF patients with relatively slowQ ? kinetics, central hemodynamics may limit skeletal muscle oxygenation during moderate-intensity exercise.},

abstract = {Ischemic preconditioning (IPC), which involves intermittent periods of ischemia followed by reperfusion, is an effective clinical intervention that reduces the risk of myocardial injury and confers ischemic tolerance to skeletal muscle. Repeated bouts of IPC have been shown to stimulate long-term changes vascular function, however, it is unclear what metabolic adaptations may occur locally in the muscle. Therefore, we investigated 7 days of bilateral lower limb IPC (4 × 5 min) above limb occlusion pressure (220 mmHg; n = 10), or sham (20 mmHg; n = 10), on local muscle oxidative capacity and microvascular blood flow. Oxidative capacity was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during repeated short duration arterial occlusions (300 mmHg). Microvascular blood flow was assessed during the recovery from submaximal isometric plantar flexion exercises at 40 and 60% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). Following the intervention period, beyond the late phase of protection (72 h), muscle oxidative recovery kinetics were speeded by 13% (rate constant pre 2.89 ± 0.47 min-1 vs. post 3.32 ± 0.69 min-1; P < 0.05) and resting muscle oxygen consumption (mimageO2) was reduced by 16.4% (pre 0.39 ± 0.16%.s-1 vs. post 0.33 ± 0.14%.s-1; P < 0.05). During exercise, changes in deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb) from rest to steady state were reduced at 40 and 60% MVC (16 and 12%, respectively, P < 0.05) despite similar measures of total hemoglobin (tHb). At the cessation of exercise, the time constant for recovery in oxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb) was accelerated at 40 and 60% MVC (by 33 and 43%, respectively) suggesting enhanced reoxygenation in the muscle. No changes were reported for systemic measures of resting heart rate or blood pressure. In conclusion, repeated bouts of IPC over 7 consecutive days increased skeletal muscle oxidative capacity and microvascular muscle blood flow. These findings are consistent with enhanced mitochondrial and vascular function following repeated IPC and may be of clinical or sporting interest to enhance or offset reductions in muscle oxidative capacity.},

abstract = {The Key Search Task (KST) is a neuropsychological test that requires strategies for searching a lost key in an imaginary field. This request may involve different cognitive processes as mental imagery and navigation planning. This study was aimed at investigating, by a twenty-channel functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) system, the hemodynamic response (i.e., oxygenated-hemoglobin (O 2 Hb) and deoxygenated-hemoglobin (HHb) changes) of the prefrontal cortex in navigation planning. A right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (rVLPFC) activation during the KST was hypothesized. Thirty-eight volunteers performed the KST and a Control Task (CT), the latter requiring the volunteers to mark the X letter. An activation (i.e., increase/decrease in O 2 Hb/HHb) of: 1) rVLPFC during the KST execution, and 2) bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during the CT execution was found. The present study provides a contribution in localizing the rVLPFC as the critically active region, within the frontal lobes, that was found maximally activated during mental navigation in the mind's eye of healthy participants while performing the KST. Considering the contribution of rVLPFC in spatial navigation, its activation suggests that the KST could be adopted in the clinical routine for investigating navigation planning. Compared to other neuroimaging techniques, fNIRS (with its relatively low physical constraints) contributes to better clarifying the role of rVLPFC in some aspects of human navigation. Therefore, the combined use of the fNIRS and the KST could be considered as an innovative and valid tool to evaluate fundamental functions for everyday life, such as spatial navigation planning.},

Receiving optodes are placed over the left and right hemispheres of a piglet (C3, C4 EEG placement code) and one transmitting optode centrally (Cz position). Optical densities (OD) are measured during stable normo, mild, and deep hypoxemia. This is done for skin condition 1: all optodes on the skin; skin condition 2: transmitting optode on the skin and one receiving optode on the skull; and skin condition 3: all optodes on the skull. Absolute changes of oxy- (cO2Hb), deoxyhemoglobin (cHHb), and total hemoglobin (ctHb) concentrations [micromolL] are calculated from the ODs. These absolute changes are calculated for each skin condition with respect to normoxic condition. Additionally, for skin condition 2, the difference of concentration changes between receiver 1 (skull) and receiver 2 (skin) is calculated. The effect of skin removal is an average increase of attenuation changes by a factor of 1.66 (=0.51 OD) and of the concentration changes due to the arterial oxygen saturation steps by 23%. We conclude that skin significantly influences regional oxygenation measurements. Nevertheless, it is hypothesized that the estimated concentration changes are dominated by changes of the oxygenation in the brain.},

In addition, the intensity of exercise based on the individual's heart rate response during forward and backward walking treadmill work was assessed. DESIGN Test-retest reliability study. SUBJECTS A total of 22 clients with Parkinson disease (Hoehn and Yahr stages 1-3). MAIN MEASURES Outcome measures of heart rate, blood pressure, and cerebral oxygen response were assessed during forward and backward walking on a treadmill for a total of 20 minutes up to an intensity based on the clients' prior treadmill work and their rate of perceived exertion. RESULTS Good to excellent 6-8 day test-retest findings for both forward (intraclass correlation coefficient(2,1), 0.89-0.99) and backward (intraclass correlation coefficient(2,1), 0.82-0.99) treadmill walking were found for heart rate, blood pressure, cerebral oxygen response, and the participants' rate of perceived exertion. Low minimum detectable change (MDC)95 values were found for heart rate (4.9 and 4.8), rate of perceived exertion (1.0 and 1.6), and cerebral oxygen response (1.2 and 0.92), during forward and backward walking, respectively. All treadmill exercise heart rates attained by participants were within an intensity of 54%-87% of the client's predicted maximal heart rate. CONCLUSION Treadmill exercise training can be included in Parkinson disease exercise programs with relative confidence in test-retest reliability of cardiovascular response. It was also demonstrated that individuals with Parkinson disease previously involved with exercise consistently self-select walking speeds which induce heart rates within recommended guidelines for positive cardiovascular adaptation.},

@article{smith_influence_2010,
abstract = {The study examined the influence of cerebral (prefrontal cortex) and muscle (vastus lateralis) oxygenation on the ability to perform repeated, cycling sprints. Thirteen team-sport athletes performed ten, 10-s sprints (with 30 s of rest) under normoxic (FIO2 0.21) and acute hypoxic (F IO2 0.13) conditions in a randomised, single-blind fashion and crossover design. Mechanical work was calculated and arterial O2 saturation (SpO2) was estimated via pulse oximetry for every sprint. Cerebral and muscle oxy-(O2Hb), deoxy-(HHb), and total haemoglobin (THb) were monitored continuously by near-infrared spectroscopy. Compared with normoxia, hypoxia induced larger decrements in SpO 2 and work (11.6 and 7.6%, respectively; P < 0.05). In the muscle, we observed a fairly constant level of deoxygenation across sprints, with no effect of the condition. In normoxia, regional cerebral oxygenation increased during the first two sprints and slightly fluctuated thereafter. In contrast, this initial cerebral hyper-oxygenation was attenuated in hypoxia. Changes in [O2Hb] and [HHb] occurred earlier and were larger in hypoxia compared with normoxia (P < 0.05), while regional blood volume ($\Delta$[THb]) remained unaffected by the condition. Changes in cerebral [HHb] and mechanical work were strongly correlated in normoxia and hypoxia (R 2 = 0.81 and R 2 = 0.85, respectively; P < 0.05), although the slope of this relationship differed (normoxia, -351.3 ± 183.3 vs. hypoxia, -442.4 ± 227.2; P < 0.05). The results of this NIRS study show that O 2 availability influences prefrontal cortex, but not muscle, oxygenation during repeated, short sprints. By using a hypoxia paradigm, the study suggests that cerebral oxygenation contributes to the impairment of repeated-sprint ability. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2010.},

abstract = {The benefits of exercise for smokers attempting to quit are partially dependent on physical activity levels prior to cessation. Mood disturbances can manifest within 30 min of smoking a cigarette and contribute to negative reinforcement of smoking behavior over time, whereas a single bout of aerobic exercise can reduce negative mood states and improve affect on a similar timescale in non-smokers. The acute effects of exercise among non-abstaining smokers immediately after a cigarette are unknown but may have clinical implications for smokers considering cessation. The aim of this study was to examine the concurrent effects of exercise on mood disturbance and prefrontal brain hemodynamic response to emotionally arousing scenes 30 min after smoking a cigarette and to test whether prefrontal brain hemodynamic response was correlated with affective ratings of the scenes. Fifteen cigarette smokers, averaging 47.6 cigarettes/week in the year prior to screening, served as participants. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy was used to measure hemodynamic status over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Participants viewed pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral scenes prior to smoking a cigarette and 30 min later after seated rest or exercise at a preferred intensity. Mood disturbance was assessed by the Profile of Mood States-Brief Form four times: before smoking a cigarette, before and after exercise and rest, and after a post-condition (exercise/rest) exposure to emotionally arousing scenes. Compared to seated rest, cycling after a cigarette reduced mood disturbance (p = =.038) and DLPFC hemodynamic response to unpleasant (p = =.003) and pleasant (p = =.021) scenes relative to neutral scenes. DLPFC hemodynamic response was not related to affective ratings of scenes. We report that cycling for 20 min at a preferred intensity reduces mood disturbances which occur shortly after smoking a cigarette and blunts DLPFC hemodynamic response to emotionally arousing scenes. The findings encourage further investigation of exercise for smokers in the maintenance stage of smoking cessation.},

abstract = {Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive method to measure brain activity via changes in the degree of hemoglobin oxygenation through the intact skull. As optically measured hemoglobin signals strongly correlate with BOLD signals, simultaneous measurement using NIRS and fMRI promises a significant mutual enhancement of temporal and spatial resolutions. Although there exists a powerful statistical parametric mapping tool in fMRI, current public domain statistical tools for NIRS have several limitations related to the quantitative analysis of simultaneous recording studies with fMRI. In this paper, a new public domain statistical toolbox known as NIRS-SPM is described. It enables the quantitative analysis of NIRS signal. More specifically, NIRS data are statistically analyzed based on the general linear model (GLM) and Sun's tube formula. The p-values are calculated as the excursion probability of an inhomogeneous random field on a representation manifold that is dependent on the structure of the error covariance matrix and the interpolating kernels. NIRS-SPM not only enables the calculation of activation maps of oxy-, deoxy-hemoglobin and total hemoglobin, but also allows for the super-resolution localization, which is not possible using conventional analysis tools. Extensive experimental results using finger tapping and memory tasks confirm the viability of the proposed method. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background: Recent evidence suggests that skeletal muscle dysfunction is involved in disability progression in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the relationship between muscle dysfunction and walking impairments in MS remains unclear. Thus, the cross-sectional relationships between musclespecific oxidative capacity and walking endurance in women with MS were evaluated. Methods: Twenty women with MS (11 African American, 9 white) were tested. Muscle oxidative capacity of the medial gastrocnemius was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy after electrical stimulation. Muscle endurance was evaluated using accelerometer-based mechanomyography during electrical stimulation. Muscle strength was measured during maximal voluntary plantarflexion using handheld dynamometry. Walking function was measured using the Timed 25-Foot Walk test and the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT). Results: Reduced muscle oxidative capacity (R2 = 0.68-0.71, P <.01) and muscle endurance (R2 = 0.59-0.78, P <.01) were associated with lower Timed 25-Foot Walk time and 6MWT distance. Muscle strength was weakly correlated to 6MWT distance (R2 = 0.21, P =.02). No differences in muscle function or clinical outcome measures were found between African American and white subgroups. Women with moderate-to-severe disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] score, 5.0-6.5) had significantly reduced muscle oxidative capacity, muscle endurance, and walking ability compared with women with mild disability (EDSS score, 2.5-4.5). Conclusions: Reductions in muscle function in people with MS are related to declines in walking function across all levels of disability. Muscle dysfunction is not differentially related to walking impairment in African American and white women with MS.},

However, there is limited investigation into the effects of BFR on cardiovascular health, particularly central hemodynamic load. Purpose: To determine the effects of BFR exercise on central hemodynamic load (heart rate—HR, central pressures, arterial wave reflection, and aortic stiffness). Methods: Fifteen males (age = 25 ± 2 years; BMI = 27 ± 2 kg/m2, handgrip max voluntary contraction-MVC = 50 ± 2 kg) underwent 5-min bouts (counter-balanced, 10 min rest between) of rhythmic unilateral handgrip (1 s squeeze, 2 s relax) performed with a moderate-load (60% MVC) with and without BFR (i.e., 71 ± 5% arterial inflow flow reduction, assessed via Doppler ultrasound), and also with a low-load (40% MVC) with BFR. Outcomes included HR, central mean arterial pressure (cMAP), arterial wave reflection (augmentation index, AIx; wave reflection magnitude, RM%), aortic arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity, aPWV), and peripheral (vastus lateralis) microcirculatory response (tissue saturation index, TSI%). Results: HR increased above baseline and time control for all handgrip bouts, but was similar between the moderate load with and without BFR conditions (moderate-load with BFR = + 9 ± 2; moderate-load without BFR = + 8 ± 2 bpm, p < 0.001). A similar finding was noted for central pressure (e.g., moderate load with BFR, cMAP = + 14 ± 1 mmHg, p < 0.001). No change occurred for RM% or AIx (p > 0.05) for any testing stage. TSI% increased during the moderate-load conditions (p = 0.01), and aPWV increased above baseline following moderate-load handgrip with BFR only (p = 0.012). Conclusions: Combined with BFR, moderate load handgrip training with BFR does not significantly augment central hemodynamic load during handgrip exercise in young healthy men.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine thermal and local blood flow responses in the head area of the preadolescent boys during exposure to radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields produced by a GSM mobile phone. The design was a double-blinded sham-controlled study of 26 boys, aged 14-15 years. The SAR distribution was calculated and modelled in detail. The duration of the sham periods and exposures with GSM 900 phone was 15 min each, and the tests were carried out in a climatic chamber in controlled thermoneutral conditions. The ear canal temperatures were registered from both ear canals, and the skin temperatures at several sites of the head, trunk and extremities. The local cerebral blood flow was monitored by a near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and the autonomic nervous system function by recordings of ECG and continuous blood pressure. During the short-term RF exposure, local cerebral blood flow did not change, the ear canal temperature did not increase significantly and autonomic nervous system was not interfered. The strengths of this study were the age of the population, multifactorial physiological monitoring and strictly controlled thermal environment. The limitations of the study were large inter-individual variation in the physiological responses, and short duration of the exposure. Longer provocation protocols, however, might cause in children distress related confounding physiological responses. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

This research was conducted following the PRISMA methodology. The systematic search was conducted in November 2019 and yielded 26 different scientific articles. Only peer-reviewed full-text article were included as abstracts are too short to allow proper explanation of the RRSAT methodology that was employed. According to the present literature, practitioners should use the following assessments: the 6×40m RRSA protocol with one Change of Direction (COD) (20+20 m with a 180° COD) and 25s of passive recovery between sprints with soccer players; the Intensive Repeated Sprint Ability (IRSA) test with men basketball players; the Futsal Intermittent Endurance Test (FIET) with futsal players; the Repeated Shuttle Sprint Test (RSST) with men handball players; and the Multiple Repeated Sprint Ability test for Badminton players (MRSAB). The present review should serve as a reference standard for RRSA tests. Further research should be directed towards creating and validating more specific RRSA tests protocols to each sports physiological and physical demands.},

abstract = { The majority of in vivo applications of near infrared spectroscopic (NIRS) monitoring use transcutaneous optode placement over the tissue of interest. Invasive application of optodes is occasionally described for monitoring tissue too deep for transcutaneous study, principally in animal models, but sometimes in humans. Invasive fibre-optic probes have been developed for a range of other spectroscopic applications including some in vivo . We describe the design and feasibility testing in a human subject of a vaginal probe to extend the scope of recently developed techniques for NIRS monitoring in urology. Design criteria included: use of optodes and cables with dimensions compatible with appropriate overall probe size; dual channel capability (for simultaneous monitoring of bladder wall and urethral sphincter); secure interoptode separation at correct distance for required penetration; ease of insertion, orientation and avoidance of movement artifact. Components were obtained that met design criteria and allowed use of the probe connected to a commercial NIRS instrument. Iterative development established optimal interoptode distance and secure positioning of a probe that could be housed for in vivo study within a disposable vaginal speculum. The feasibility of monitoring changes in chromophore concentration in the bladder detrusor and urethral sphincter using this intravaginal probe was evident from four separate studies during voiding and a series of physiologic events (cough, Valsalva and Kiegel contractions) in a healthy female volunteer. This small series suggests that reproducible data free of movement artifact, with consistent patterns and magnitudes of chromophore change can be obtained with the probe designed.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: This study compared the executive function (EF) performance induced by moderate-intensity continuous exercise (MICE) versus high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE), under two exercise modalities (i.e., running vs. cycling), and explore whether the changes in EF performance were related to the hemodynamics response of cerebral prefrontal area of the brain. METHODS: In a randomized cross-over design, 16 male participants completed 4 main trials, i.e., 40 minutes of moderate-intensity continuous running (MICR) or cycling (MICC) with 60% maximal oxygen consumption (VO(2max)), 33 minutes of high-intensity interval running (HIIR) or cycling (HIIC). For HIIR or HIIC trials, the exercise intensity was 60% VO(2max) for the first 5 minutes, followed by four 4-minute bouts of exercise at 90% VO(2max), separated by 3-minute active recovery at 60% VO(2max). EF was assessed via the Eriksen Flanker task (EFT) before (Pre), immediately after (Post 0), and 10 minutes after exercise (Post 10). Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) measured oxygenated hemoglobin (O(2)Hb) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb) concentrations in the prefrontal area. Each main trial measured the concentrations of blood glucose and lactate, heart rate, and rate of perceived exertion. RESULTS: (1) Compared to the reaction time in EFT during the pretest, the corresponding reaction time was shorter at Post 10 (P < 0.01) but not at Post 0 (P = 0.06). Specifically, reaction time was shorter at Post 10 than that in the pretest in HIIC (P = 0.04), MICC (P = 0.01), and HIIR (P < 0.01) but not MICR. (2) The fNIRS results revealed that O(2)Hb concentrations in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex area were much lower during Post 10 than during the pretest. (3) The blood lactate concentrations were not associated with EF performance regarding both accuracy and reaction time. CONCLUSION: Compared to the pretest, EF was greater after the 10-minute rest during recovery but not immediately after exercise. The different HIIE or MICE protocols adopted in the present study may elicit minor differences regarding their effects on EF.},

abstract = {Introduction: Neural alterations in limbic and prefrontal circuits in association with self-injurious behavior have been studied primarily in adult borderline personality disorder (BPD). In adolescent patients, research is still sparse. Here, we used resting functional near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to examine oxygenation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and its association with symptom severity in adolescents engaging in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and matched healthy controls (HC). Methods: Adolescents (12–17 years) with recurrent episodes of NSSI (n = 170) and healthy controls (n = 43) performed a low-demanding resting-state vanilla baseline task. Mean oxygenation of the PFC and functional connectivity within the PFC, were measured using an 8-channel functional NIRS system (Octamon, Artinis, The Netherlands). Various clinical variables derived from diagnostic interviews and self-reports were included in statistical analyses to explore potential associations with PFC oxygenation and connectivity. Results: Adolescents with NSSI showed significantly decreased PFC oxygenation compared to HC, as indexed by oxygenated hemoglobin. Lower PFC oxygenation was associated with greater adverse childhood experiences and less health-related quality of life (HRQoL). While there was no evidence for alterations in PFC connectivity in adolescents engaging in NSSI compared to HC, increased PFC connectivity in the full sample was associated with greater adverse childhood experience, greater BPD pathology, greater depression severity and psychological burden in general, as well as lower HRQoL. Conclusion: This study is the first to examine PFC oxygenation using NIRS technology in adolescents engaging in NSSI. Overall, results indicate small effects not specific to NSSI. Clinical implications of these findings and recommendations for further research are discussed.},

abstract = {Background: Worldwide >2.3 billion individuals are affected by bladder disease. The current evaluative test is invasive, associated with complications and often declined. Non-invasive evaluation of bladder hemodynamics using continuouswave near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is an established technique. Recently, fNIRS was shown to detect activity in the brain regions previously identified by fMRI to relate to bladder sensation and control of voiding. We now report a system for simultaneous wireless fNIRS measurements of bladder and brain. Method: Two dual-wavelength (760/850 nm) fNIRS systems were used in parallel. A 23-channel array (35 mm interoptode distance) housed in a neoprene cap was positioned over the bilateral frontal cortex, and a 4-channel grid of 4 emitters and 1 detector taped to the skin over the bladder. Natural bladder filling to capacity and spontaneous voiding were monitored in two volunteer subjects. Proprietary software (Oxysoft v3.2.56) linked the devices, and generated video and graphical displays of changes in oxygenated, de-oxygenated, and total hemoglobin from raw optical data recorded at 50 Hz. Results: Simultaneous brain and bladder data were captured in both subjects. Localized brain activity was evident on video as topographical colorimetric changes indicative of increases in oxyhemoglobin concentration in areas previously linked via fMRI to bladder sensation and function; signal intensity varied in relation to phases of voiding. In the bladder detrusor muscle oxyhemoglobin increased prior to permission to void; changes during uroflow differed between the symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects. Conclusion: Simultaneous wireless fNIRS of brain and bladder is feasible, and offers new physiological dimensions for evaluating bladder control and function. {\textcopyright} COPYRIGHT SPIE.

abstract = {The aim of the current study was to compare the effects of 6 weeks of small-sided game (SSG) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on aerobic fitness and muscle oxygenation during a repeated sprint (RS) sequence in elite male junior basketball players. Twenty participants (14.3 ± 0.5 years; 176.8 ± 12.5 cm; 74.5 ± 9.8 kg) performed pre- and post-tests interspersed by 6 weeks of SSG or HIIT training. Testing sessions consisted of the 30-15 intermittent fitness test and an RS sequence (2 bouts of 15 seconds). During RS, muscle oxygenation parameters (tissue saturation index [TSI, %], postsprint muscle reoxygenation rate) were measured using near-infrared spectroscopy. The results showed that both training interventions similarly improved maximal aerobic speed (V IFT , 3.4 and 4.1%, respectively, for HIIT and SSG, P < 0.05) as well as RS ability (smaller percentage decrement by 62.5 and 21.6%, respectively, for HIIT and SSG, P < 0.05). Both training interventions also resulted in a greater $\Delta$TSI during the second sprint (47.8-114%, P < 0.05) and significant improvements in postsprint reoxygenation after both sprints (+23.0 to +107.7%). Finally, the variation in muscle reoxygenation after sprint 1 was significantly associated with improvements in aerobic ($\Delta$V IFT , r = 0.61, P = 0.008) and anaerobic ($\Delta$% Dec during RS, r = 20.487, P = 0.028) performances. The current study has observed that SSG and HIIT resulted in similar improvements in aerobic and anaerobic variables and a better muscle oxygenation capacity during RS. Coaches should be aware that both trainings are applicable methodologies to improve in-season aerobic and anaerobic fitness capacities in junior basketball players.},

abstract = {Recently, interest has been growing to understand the underlying dynamic directional relationship between simultaneously activated regions of the brain during motor task performance. Such directionality analysis (or effective connectivity analysis), based on non-invasive electrophysiological (electroencephalography—EEG) and hemodynamic (functional near infrared spectroscopy—fNIRS; and functional magnetic resonance imaging—fMRI) neuroimaging modalities can provide an estimate of the motor task-related information flow from one brain region to another. Since EEG, fNIRS and fMRI modalities achieve different spatial and temporal resolutions of motor-task related activation in the brain, the aim of this study was to determine the effective connectivity of cortico-cortical sensorimotor networks during finger movement tasks measured by each neuroimaging modality. Nine healthy subjects performed right hand finger movement tasks of different complexity (simple finger tapping-FT, simple finger sequence-SFS, and complex finger sequence-CFS). We focused our observations on three cortical regions of interest (ROIs), namely the contralateral sensorimotor cortex (SMC), the contralateral premotor cortex (PMC) and the contralateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). We estimated the effective connectivity between these ROIs using conditional Granger causality (GC) analysis determined from the time series signals measured by fMRI (blood oxygenation level-dependent-BOLD), fNIRS (oxygenated-O2Hb and deoxygenated-HHb hemoglobin), and EEG (scalp and source level analysis) neuroimaging modalities. The effective connectivity analysis showed significant bi-directional information flow between the SMC, PMC, and DLPFC as determined by the EEG (scalp and source), fMRI (BOLD) and fNIRS (O2Hb and HHb) modalities for all three motor tasks. However the source level EEG GC values were significantly greater than the other modalities. In addition, only the source level EEG showed a significantly greater forward than backward information flow between the ROIs. This simultaneous fMRI, fNIRS and EEG study has shown through independent GC analysis of the respective time series that a bi-directional effective connectivity occurs within a cortico-cortical sensorimotor network (SMC, PMC and DLPFC) during finger movement tasks.},

As prefrontal cognitive resources are involved in dual task walking, evaluation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is required. Objective. To investigate the effect of dopaminergic medication on PFC activity and gait parameters during dual task walking in people with PD. Methods. A total of 20 individuals with PD (69.8 ± 5.9 years) and 30 healthy older people (68.0 ± 5.6 years) performed 2 walking conditions: single and dual task (walking while performing a digit vigilance task). A mobile functional near infrared spectroscopy system and an electronic sensor carpet were used to analyze PFC activation and gait parameters, respectively. Relative concentrations of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) from the left and right PFC were measured. Results. People with PD in the off state did not present changes in HbO2 level in the left PFC across walking conditions. In contrast, in the on state, they presented increased HbO2 levels during dual task compared with single task. Regardless of medication state, people with PD presented increased HbO2 levels in the right PFC during dual task walking compared with single task. The control group demonstrated increased PFC activity in both hemispheres during dual task compared with single task. People with PD showed increases in both step length and velocity in the on state compared with the off state. Conclusions. PD limits the activation of the left PFC during dual task walking, and dopaminergic medication facilitates its recruitment.},

abstract = {Introduction: Widespread cerebral hypometabolism occurs in multiple sclerosis (MS) which can result in cognitive dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a 7-day water aerobics exercise intervention on the cerebral hyperemic response to a cognitive task in individuals with MS. Methods: Thirty-one individuals diagnosed with MS were assigned to an exercise group (N = 17) or a control group (N = 14). For 7 days, the control group maintained normal activity, while the exercise group participated in water aerobic exercise. Oxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb) was measured using nearinfrared spectroscopy at rest and during a cognitive task prior to and after the 7 day period. Results: For the exercise group, there was no significant difference between O2Hb from rest to cognition at pre-testing (t(16) = -1.91, p = 0.07), however O2Hb significantly increased from rest during cognition at post-testing (t(16) = -2.30, p = 0.04). For the control group, O2Hb significantly increased from rest during cognition at pre-testing (t(13) = -2.51, p = 0.03), but did not at post-testing (t(13) = -1.6, p = 0.13). Conclusions: Water aerobics exercise could be a useful therapy for improving the cerebral perfusion in individuals with MS.},

abstract = {Purpose: While acute hypoxic exposure enhances exercise-induced central fatigue and can alter corticospinal excitability and inhibition, the effect of prolonged hypoxic exposure on these parameters remains to be clarified. We hypothesized that 5 days of altitude exposure would (i) normalize exercise-induced supraspinal fatigue during isolated muscle exercise to sea level (SL) values and (ii) increase corticospinal excitability and inhibition. Methods: Eleven male subjects performed intermittent isometric elbow flexions at 50% of maximal voluntary contraction to task failure at SL and after 1 (D1) and 5 (D5) days at 4350 m. Transcranial magnetic stimulation and peripheral electrical stimulation were used to assess supraspinal and peripheral fatigues. Pre-frontal cortex and biceps brachii oxygenation was monitored by near-infrared spectroscopy. Results: Exercise duration was not statistically different between SL (1095 ± 562 s), D1 (1132 ± 516 s), and D5 (1440 ± 689 s). No significant differences were found between the three experimental conditions in maximal voluntary activation declines at task failure (SL −16.8 ± 9.5%; D1 −25.5 ± 11.2%; D5 −21.8 ± 7.0%; p > 0.05). Exercise-induced peripheral fatigue was larger at D5 versus SL (100 Hz doublet at task failure: −58.8 ± 16.6 versus −41.8 ± 20.1%; p < 0.05). Corticospinal excitability at 50% maximal voluntary contraction was lower at D5 versus SL (brachioradialis p < 0.05, biceps brachii p = 0.055). Cortical silent periods were shorter at SL versus D1 and D5 (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The present results show similar patterns of supraspinal fatigue development during isometric elbow flexions at SL and after 1 and 5 days at high altitude, despite larger amount of peripheral fatigue at D5, lowered corticospinal excitability and enhanced corticospinal inhibition at altitude.},

abstract = {To determine the effects of bladderbox alarms during venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (va-ECMO) on cerebral oxygenation and hemodynamics, six lambs were prospectively treated with va-ECMO and bladderbox alarms were simulated. Changes in concentrations of oxyhemoglobin ($\Delta$cO2Hb), deoxyhemoglobin ($\Delta$cHHb), and total Hb ($\Delta$ctHb) were measured using near infrared spectrophotometry. Fluctuations in Hb oxygenation index ($\Delta$HbD) and cerebral blood volume ($\Delta$CBV) were calculated. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), blood flow in the left carotid artery (Qcar), and central venous pressure (CVP) were registered. Bladderbox alarms were simulated by increasing the ECMO flow or partially clamping the venous cannula and resolved by decreasing the ECMO flow, unclamping the cannula, or intravascular volume administration. CBV, HbD, MAP, and Qcar decreased significantly during bladderbox alarms, whereas HR and CVP increased. After the bladderbox alarms, CBV and HbD increased significantly to values above baseline. For HbD, this increase was higher during intravascular volume administration. MAP, Qcar, and CVP recovered to preexperiment values but increased further with volume administration. HR was increased at the end of our measurements. We conclude that Bladderbox alarms during va-ECMO treatment result in significant fluctuations in cerebral oxygenation and hemodynamics, a possible risk factor for intracranial lesions. {\textcopyright} 2009 International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.},

abstract = {We describe a case of experimentally induced pre-syncope in a healthy young man when exposed to increased inspired CO2 in a background of hypoxia. Acute severe hypoxia (FIO2=0.10) was tolerated, but adding CO2 to the inspirate caused pre-syncope symptoms accompanied by hypotension and large reductions in both mean and diastolic middle cerebral artery velocity, while systolic flow velocity was maintained. The mismatch of cerebral perfusion pressure and vascular tone caused unique retrograde cerebral blood flow at the end of systole and a reduction in cerebral tissue oxygenation. We speculate that this occurrence of pre-syncope was due to hypoxia-induced inhibition of brain regions responsible for compensatory sympathetic activity to relative hypercapnia. {\textcopyright} Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.},

@article{Bonilauri2020,
abstract = {Background: The management of people affected by age-related neurological disorders requires the adoption of targeted and cost-effective interventions to cope with chronicity. Therapy adaptation and rehabilitation represent major targets requiring long-term follow-up of neurodegeneration or, conversely, the promotion of neuroplasticity mechanisms. However, affordable and reliable neurophysiological correlates of cerebral activity to be used throughout treatment stages are often lacking. The aim of this systematic review is to highlight actual applications of functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) as a versatile optical neuroimaging technology for investigating cortical hemodynamic activity in the most common chronic neurological conditions. Methods: We reviewed studies investigating fNIRS applications in Parkinson's Disease (PD), Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) as those focusing on motor and cognitive impairment in ageing and Multiple Sclerosis (MS) as the most common chronic neurological disease in young adults. The literature search was conducted on NCBI PubMed and Web of Science databases by PRISMA guidelines. Results: We identified a total of 63 peer-reviewed articles. The AD spectrum is the most investigated pathology with 40 articles ranging from the traditional monitoring of tissue oxygenation to the analysis of functional resting-state conditions or cognitive functions by means of memory and verbal fluency tasks. Conversely, applications in PD (12 articles) and MS (11 articles) are mainly focused on the characterization of motor functions and their association with dual-task conditions. The most investigated cortical area is the prefrontal cortex, since reported to play an important role in age-related compensatory mechanism and neurofunctional changes associated to these chronic neurological conditions. Interestingly, only 9 articles applied a longitudinal approach. Conclusion: The results indicate that fNIRS is mainly employed for the cross-sectional characterization of the clinical phenotypes of these pathologies, whereas data on its utility for longitudinal monitoring as surrogate biomarkers of disease progression and rehabilitation effects are promising but still lacking.},

abstract = { The majority of in vivo applications of near-infrared spectroscopic (NIRS) monitoring use continuous wave instruments that require a fiberoptic cable connection between the subject and the instrument during monitoring. In studies of muscle physiology where subjects are exercising, and particularly in those who are engaged in sports activity, a wireless instrument with telemetric capacity provides obvious advantages. Having access to reliable telemetric NIRS technology will also increase the practicality and scope of this biomedical monitoring technique in clinical settings.  We report the feasibility of using a wireless continuous wave NIRS instrument with light emitting diodes, spatially resolved configuration, and Bluetooth {\textregistered} capability to study skeletal muscle oxygenation and hemodynamics during isometric contraction and ischemia induction. In ten healthy subjects comparable patterns of change in chromophore concentration (oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin), total hemoglobin and muscle oxygen saturation were observed during 3 sets of isometric voluntary forearm muscle contraction at 10, 30 and 50% of maximum voluntary capacity (MVC), and a period of ischemia generated subsequently.This small series indicates that data with good intra- and inter-subject reproducibility that is free of movement artifact can be obtained with the wireless NIRS instrument described. The validity of these muscle studies demonstrate a basis for applying wireless NIRS monitoring to publisher-id biomedical applications.},

@article{alhammoud_hypoxia_2018,
abstract = {This study examined the effects of acute hypoxia on maximal and explosive torque and fatigability in knee extensors of skiers. Twenty-two elite male alpine skiers performed 35 maximal, repeated isokinetic knee extensions at 180°s-1 (total exercise duration 61.25 s) in normoxia (NOR, FiO2 0.21) and normobaric hypoxia (HYP, FiO2 0.13) in a randomized, single-blind design. Peak torque and rate of torque development (RTD) from 0 to 100 ms and associated Vastus Lateralis peak EMG activity and rate of EMG rise (RER) were determined for each contraction. Relative changes in deoxyhemoglobin concentration of the VL muscle were monitored by near-infrared spectroscopy. Peak torque and peak EMG activity did not differ between conditions and decreased similarly with fatigue (p < 0.001), with peak torque decreasing continuously but EMG activity decreasing significantly after 30 contractions only. Compared to NOR, RTD, and RER values were lower in HYP during the first 12 and 9 contractions, respectively (both p < 0.05). Deoxyhemoglobin concentration during the last five contractions was higher in HYP than NOR (p = 0.050) but the delta between maximal and minimal deoxyhemoglobin for each contraction was similar in HYP and NOR suggesting a similar muscle O2 utilization. Post-exercise heart rate (138 ± 24 bpm) and blood lactate concentration (5.8 ± 3.1 mmol.l-1) did not differ between conditions. Arterial oxygen saturation was significantly lower (84 ± 4 vs. 98 ± 1%, p < 0.001) and ratings of perceived exertion higher (6 ± 1 vs. 5 ± 1, p < 0.001) in HYP than NOR. In summary, hypoxia limits RTD via a decrease in neural drive in elite alpine skiers undertaking maximal repeated isokinetic knee extensions, but the effect of hypoxic exposure is negated as fatigue develops. Isokinetic testing protocols for elite alpine skiers should incorporate RTD and RER measurements as they display a higher sensitivity than peak torque and EMG activity.},

abstract = {Spinal cord injury (SCI) is associated with autonomic imbalance and significant secondary conditions, including cardiac and brain dysfunction that adversely impact health and wellbeing. This study will investigate the effectiveness (intention-to-treat) of a neuro-cardiac self-regulation therapy to improve autonomic and neural/brain activity in adults with SCI living in the community. A two-arm parallel, randomised controlled trial in which adults with SCI living in the community post-rehabilitation will be randomly assigned to a treatment or control group. The treatment group (N = 60) aged 18–70 years with a chronic traumatic or non-traumatic SCI, will receive intervention sessions once per week for 10 weeks, designed to regulate autonomic activity using computer-based feedback of heart rate variability and controlled breathing (called HRV-F). Comprehensive neurophysiological and psychological assessment will occur at baseline, immediate post-treatment, and 6 and 12-months post-treatment. Primary outcome measures include electrocardiography/heart rate variability (to assess autonomic nervous system function) and transcranial doppler sonography (to assess cerebral blood circulation in basal cerebral arteries). Secondary outcomes measures include continuous blood pressure, electroencephalography, functional near-infrared spectroscopy, respiration/breath rate, electrooculography, cognitive capacity, psychological status, pain, fatigue, sleep and quality of life. Controls (N = 60) will receive usual community care, reading material and a brief telephone call once per week for 10 weeks and be similarly assessed over the same time period as the HRV-F group. Linear mixed model analysis with repeated measures will determine effectiveness of HRV-F and latent class mixture modelling used to determine trajectories for primary and selected secondary outcomes of interest. Treatments for improving autonomic function after SCI are limited. It is therefore important to establish whether a neuro-cardiac self-regulation therapy can result in improved autonomic functioning post-SCI, as well as whether HRV-F is associated with better outcomes for secondary conditions such as cardiovascular health, cognitive capacity and mental health.

abstract = {Thinking creatively requires the ability to consciously augment creative insight through processes such as analogical reasoning and relational cognition. Prior work has examined augmented states of creativity using a modified verb generation task which requires brief engagement in attempts to think creatively during MRI. In this study, we employed the verb generation task to examine augmented creative states and frontopolar cortex activation in a less-constrained setting using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Participants (n = 29) were presented with a noun and were required to think of an associated verb. In 50% of the trials, participants were instructed to ‘think creatively' (cued condition) as opposed to stating the first or most prominent verb that came to mind (uncued condition). The task was administered in French to native speakers. Hemodynamic responses were recorded over the frontopolar cortex using fNIRS. The relatedness of the noun-verb pairs was calculated and other measures of creativity (the Alternate Uses Test, Compound Remote Associate Test and the Biographical Inventory of Creative Behaviors) were recorded. We showed that in the cued condition, semantic scores were higher (indicating more creative responses), positively associated with other measures of creativity, and changes in oxygenated hemoglobin were larger and more extensive in the left frontopolar cortex, than in the uncued condition. Our findings support the use of the verb generation task (administered in French) to augment creative states and provides further validation of the use of the task to capture creativity (i.e., processes involved in generating creative responses through distant associations). We highlight the use of fNIRS to measure associated regional changes in frontopolar cortex activity during augmented states of creativity.},

abstract = {This study investigated the effects of frequent low-load ischemic resistance exercise performed to failure on quadriceps size and performance, muscle activation, oxygen kinetics and cardiovascular responses. Ten healthy males performed knee-extension exercise for 4 weeks (4 sessions/week) at 15% maximal voluntary muscle contraction (MVC). One leg was trained with free blood flow (C-leg) while in the other leg (I-leg) ischemia was induced by an inflatable cuff (≥230mmHg). Quadriceps cross-sectional area (CSA) of the I-leg increased by 3.4% (P<0.05). A tendency for smaller increase in muscle CSAs at the cuff level was observed. MVC force did not change in either leg, whereas the number of repetitions during exercise test to failure increased (P<0.01) by 63% in I-leg and 36% in C-leg. The decrease in muscle oxygenated hemoglobin concentration acquired by NIRS was attenuated (P<0.01) by 56% in I-leg and 21% in C-leg. Electromyographic amplitude of rectus femoris in I-leg was ∼45% lower (P<0.025) during the ischemic test. Also, ∼9% increase (P<0.05) in pre-exercise diastolic pressure was observed. In conclusion, substantial gains in muscle endurance capacity were induced, which were associated with enhanced muscle oxygen delivery. The potential negative effects of ischemic exercise with high cuff pressure on muscle and nerve and on arterial pressure regulation need further investigation. {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.},

abstract = {Given the critical risks to public health and safety that can involve lapses in attention (e.g., through implication in workplace accidents), researchers have sought to develop cognitive-state tracking technologies, capable of alerting individuals engaged in cognitively demanding tasks of potentially dangerous decrements in their levels of attention. The purpose of the present study was to address this issue through an investigation of the reliability of optical measures of cortical correlates of attention in conjunction with machine learning techniques to distinguish between states of full attention and states characterized by reduced attention capacity during a sustained attention task. Seven subjects engaged in a 30 minutes duration sustained attention reaction time task with near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring over the prefrontal and the right parietal areas. NIRS signals from the first 10 minutes of the task were considered as characterizing the 'full attention' class, while the NIRS signals from the last 10 minutes of the task were considered as characterizing the 'attention decrement' class. A two-class support vector machine algorithm was exploited to distinguish between the two levels of attention using appropriate NIRS-derived signal features. Attention decrement occurred during the task as revealed by the significant increase in reaction time in the last 10 compared to the first 10 minutes of the task (p<.05). The results demonstrate relatively good classification accuracy, ranging from 65 to 90%. The highest classification accuracy results were obtained when exploiting the oxyhemoglobin signals (i.e., from 77 to 89%, depending on the cortical area considered) rather than the deoxyhemoglobin signals (i.e., from 65 to 66%). Moreover, the classification accuracy increased to 90% when using signals from the right parietal area rather than from the prefrontal cortex. The results support the feasibility of developing cognitive tracking technologies using NIRS and machine learning techniques. {\textcopyright} 2014 Derosi{\`{e}}re et al.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: This study examined the issue of history-dependence on muscle excitation and oxygenation by using surface electromyography (EMG) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). METHODS: Eight male participants performed isometric knee extension force production tasks that started at four levels of initial force production (30, 40, 60, 70% of maximal voluntary contraction, MVC) and commonly converged to the production of 50% of MVC by increasing or decreasing knee extension forces. We quantified the integrated electromyogram (iEMG), total hemoglobin (tHb), and the desaturation rate of muscle tissue (TSISLOPE) of the vastus lateralis and compared the differences in the quantified variables between the experimental conditions. RESULTS: For the four levels of initial forces production, all the variables showed significant linear relationships with outcome forces. However, the magnitudes of the variables were varied depending on the contraction history at the terminal phase where the identical level of force production (50% of MVC) was required. At the terminal phase, the iEMG was affected by the time history of both mode (e.g., increment or decrement) and magnitude (e.g., 10% or 20% change of MVC), while the tHb and TSISLOPE showed significant differences between the time history of mode only. CONCLUSIONS: The main result of the current study demonstrates the history-dependence of the changes in physiological demands in muscle activation. In particular, the indices of muscle excitation and oxygenation at the same level of force were varied depending on the time history of contraction, which implies the indices of muscle excitation and oxygenation may not be invariant component to specify the levels of outcome forces.},

abstract = {Purpose: To study performance, physiological and biomechanical responses during repeated upper-body sprint exercise.
Methods: Twelve male elite cross-country skiers performed eight 8-s maximal poling sprints with a 22-s recovery while sitting on a modified SkiErg poling ergometer. Force, movement velocity, cycle rate, work per cycle, oxygen saturation in working muscles and pulmonary oxygen uptake were measured continuously. A 3-min all-out ergometer poling test determined VO2peak, and 1 repetition maximum (1RM) strength was determined in a movement-specific pull-down.
Results: Average sprint power was 281 ± 48 W, with the highest power on the first sprint, a progressive decline in power output over the following four sprints, and a sprint decrement of 11.7 ± 4.1 %. Cycle rate remained unchanged, whereas work per cycle progressively decreased (P < 0.05). m. triceps brachii and m. latissimus dorsi were highly desaturated already after the first sprint (all P < 0.05), whereas the response was delayed for m. biceps brachii and m. vastus lateralis. Correspondingly, increases in VO2 mainly occurred over the first two sprints (P < 0.05) and plateaued at approximately 75 % of VO2peak. 1RM correlated with power during the first four sprints and with average sprint power (r = 0.71–0.80, all P < 0.05), whereas VO2peak correlated with power in the last three sprints (r = 0.60–0.71, all P < 0.05).
Conclusions: The main decrement in upper-body sprint performance was evident in the first five sprints, followed by highly desaturated muscles and a plateau in pulmonary oxygen uptake already after the first 2–3 sprints. While high maximal strength seems important for producing power, aerobic capacity correlates with power in the last sprints.},

abstract = {To study elbow muscle load sharing we investigated the effect of external flexion-extension (FE) and pronation-supination (PS) moments and elbow angle on muscle activation and oxygen consumption (V̇O2).Two data sets were obtained. First, (n=6) electromyography (EMG) of elbow flexors (long and short heads of biceps brachii, brachioradialis, brachialis) and extensors (long and short heads of triceps brachii and anconeus) was recorded in all combinations of FE and PS moments at three force levels and four elbow angles (50°, 70°, 90° and 110°). Second, (n=4) EMG and V̇O2 of three muscles (both heads of biceps and lateral head of triceps) were measured simultaneously during a subset of the above conditions.Joint angle and therefore both moment arm and muscle length influenced both EMG amplitude and the load sharing between muscles. The principles behind load sharing, however, were difficult to quantify, since it was impossible to distinguish between all individual aspects that affect muscle activity. We found a linear relationship between EMG and V̇O2, while joint angle had no major effect. Although in general subjects showed comparable muscle activation patterns, there were also considerable inter-individual differences, which might be explained by the use of different optimisation strategies or differences in morphology. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

The aim of this study was to measure and model the time course of bilateral cortical hemodynamics (using functional near-infrared spectroscopy, fNIRS) and neural activity (using electroencephalography, EEG) during tDCS. Subjects received real (tDCS-1 and tDCS-2) and sham anodal tDCS (2 mA) targeting the left sensorimotor cortex (SMC) via a 4 × 1 high-definition electrode montage. Simultaneous EEG (23 channels) and fNIRS (16 channels) were used to measure changes in left and right SMC activity (EEG: frequency) and hemodynamics (fNIRS: oxyhemoglobin concentrations, O2Hb) during the stimulation. The O2Hb time course showed a greater increase in the fNIRS channels surrounding the anode in the stimulated left SMC during the real tDCS sessions compared to the sham. In a subsample of five subjects, a Kalman filter using an autoregressive exogenous model was able to appropriately track O2Hb signals using EEG band-power signals. The neuronal (EEG) and hemodynamic (fNIRS) responses in the stimulated left SMC region can lend to closed-loop control of anodal tDCS for optimized neuromodulation in various neuroergonomic applications.},

abstract = {Cryptorchidism is the most common male sexual disorder. In the case of an abdominal testis there is no objective criterion to choose between autotransplantation or orchiopexy after ligation of the spermatic vessels with. subsequent development of collateral blood supply, By combining near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) with pulse oximetry the active testicular blood volume (ATBV) before and after occlusion of the spermatic vessels can be calculated in an animal model. NIRS is a noninvasive continuous optical technique that measures tissue oxygenation and hemodynamics. Ten boars with one nonpalpable testis each were selected. The spermatic vessels and vas deferens were separately prepared and atraumatic occluders were placed around the vessels. ATBV was measured before and after occlusion of the spermatic vessels. The calculated ATBV was 18.3 ± 2.3 ml/100 g of testicular tissue, not corrected by division by the path length factor, accounting for light scattering in the tissue. In 5 of 10 boars no significant ATBV was found after occlusion of the spermatic vessels, suggesting subsequent atrophy. NIRS combined with pulse oximetry provides us with reproducible quantification of ATBV. The method can be used to investigate the viability of a testis after (temporary) occlusion of the spermatic vessels.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) non-invasively detects changes in the concentration of the chromophores oxygenated (DeltaO(2)Hb) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (DeltaHHb) as the bladder detrusor muscle contracts during voiding. Such data provide novel information on bladder oxygenation and hemodynamics. We evaluated the feasibility of monitoring ambulant subjects using a wireless NIRS device. METHODS: The wireless device uses paired light-emitting diodes (wavelengths 760 and 850 nm) and a silicon photodiode detector. We monitored 14 asymptomatic subjects (10 adults, 4 children) and 6 symptomatic children with non-neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) during spontaneous voiding after natural filling. The device was taped to the abdominal skin 2 cm above the symphysis pubis across the midline. The wireless NIRS data (patterns of change in chromophore concentration) were compared between subjects and to the data obtained using a laser-powered instrument. RESULTS: Graphs of DeltaO(2)Hb, DeltaHHb and total hemoglobin (DeltatHb) were obtained from all 20 patients. Data during uroflow showed reproducible patterns of bladder chromophore change between asymptomatic subjects (rise in DeltatHb/DeltaO (2)Hb), consistent with laser instrument data. In contrast, all 6 symptomatic children had a negative trend in DeltatHb, with falls in DeltaO(2)Hb. One adult experienced "shy" bladder and changes in hemodynamics/oxygenation occurred while bladder volume was unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Wireless NIRS bladder monitoring is feasible in ambulant adults and children; wireless and laser-derived data in asymptomatic subjects are comparable. Pilot data suggest that subjects with symptomatic NLUTD have impaired bladder oxygenation/ hemodynamics. The fact that chromophore changes occur when bladder volume remains constant supports the concept that NIRS data are a physiologic measure.},

abstract = {Functional neuroimaging provides an avenue for earlier diagnosis and tailored treatment of psychological disorders characterized by emotional impairment. Near-infrared spectroscopy offers ecological advantages compared to other neuroimaging techniques and suitability of measuring regions involved in emotion functions. A systematic review was conducted to evaluate the capacity of NIRS to detect activation during emotion processing and to provide recommendations for future research. Following a comprehensive literature search, we reviewed 85 journal articles which compared activation during emotional experience, regulation or perception with either a neutral condition or baseline period among healthy participants. The quantitative synthesis of outcomes was limited to thematical analysis, owing to the lack of standardisation between studies. Although most studies found increased prefrontal activity during emotional experience and regulation, the findings were more inconsistent for emotion perception. Some researchers reported increased activity during the task, some reported decreases, some no significant changes, and some reported mixed findings depending on the valence and region. We propose that variations in the cognitive task and stimuli, recruited sample, and measurement and analysis of data are the primary causes of inconsistency. Recommendations to improve consistency in future research by carefully considering the choice of population, cognitive task and analysis approach are provided.},

Patients (n = 152) with claudication were enrolled (120 males; mean age: 71.0 ± 8.6 years): 74 with diabetes (DM-PAD) and 78 without (DMfree-PAD). The degree of muscle oxygenation at symptom onset and maximal speed (Smax) during an incremental treadmill test was recorded at the gastrocnemius by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and quantified by area under the curve of oxygenated hemoglobin (AUC-Hbo2) and area under the curve of differential hemoglobin (AUC-dHb). The DM-PAD and DMfree-PAD showed similar exercise capacities inversely correlated with the degree of muscle oxygenation but significantly lower values of AUC-Hbo2 and AUC-dHb for DM-PAD at symptom onset and Smax (-356 vs -122 and -1200 vs -359, P <.0001). During a NIRS-assisted test, the report of claudication in the presence of diabetes was delayed, occurring at a lower degree of oxygenation than in patients with PAD only, with potential implications for testing, functional staging, and balance disorders.},

abstract = {Introduction: Exercise with blood flow restriction (BFR) is emerging as an effective modality for improving muscular function in clinical and athletic populations. Selection of cuff pressure is critical because it should maximize metabolic stress without completely occluding blood flow or compromising user safety. It is unknown how cuff pressures determined at rest influence blood flow hemodynamics during exercise. Purpose: We evaluated changes in blood flow and tissue perfusion before, during, and after exercise with BFR. Methods: Ten males performed rhythmic handgrip exercise (30 contractions, 30% MVC) at 0%, 60%, 80%, 100%, and 120% of limb occlusion pressure (LOP). Brachial artery blood flow and tissue saturation were assessed using Doppler ultrasound and near-infrared spectroscopy, respectively. Results: At rest blood flow generally decreased with increased pressure (0% > 60% ≈ 80% > 100% ≈ 120% LOP). During 60% and 80% LOP conditions, blood flow increased during exercise from rest and decreased after exercise (all P < 0.05). Compared to 0% LOP, relative blood flow at 60% and 80% LOP decreased by 22–47% at rest, 22–48% during exercise, and 52–71% after exercise (all P < 0.05). Increased LOP decreased tissue saturation during exercise with BFR (P < 0.05). Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and cardiac output did not differ across LOP. Conclusion: At pressures below LOP the cardiovascular system overcame the external pressure and increased blood flow to exercising muscles. Relative reductions in blood flow at rest were similar to those during exercise. Thus, the relative occlusion measured at rest approximated the degree of occlusion during exercise. Moderate cuff pressures increased metabolic stress without completely occluding blood flow.},

abstract = {We investigated the effect of hypoxic acclimatization per se, without any concomitant influence of strenuous physical activity on muscle and cerebral oxygenation. Eight healthy male subjects participated in a crossover-designed study. In random order, they conducted a 10-day normoxic (CON) and a 10-day hypoxic (EXP) confinement. Pre and post both CON and EXP confinements, subjects conducted two incremental-load cycling exercises to exhaustion; one under normoxic, and the other under hypoxic (FIO2=0.154) conditions. Oxygen uptake (V ̇ O 2), ventilation (V ̇ E), and relative changes in regional hemoglobin oxygenation ($\Delta$([HbO2]) in the cerebral cortex and in the serratus anterior (SA) and vastus lateralis (VL) muscles were measured. No changes were observed in the CON confinement. Peak work rate and V ̇ O 2 peak were similar pre and post in the EXP confinement, whereas V ̇ E increased in the EXP post normoxic and hypoxic trials (P<0.05). The exercise-induced drop in VL $\Delta$[HbO2] was less in the post- than pre-EXP trial by 4.0±0.4 and 4.2±0.6$\mu$M during normoxic and hypoxic exercise, respectively. No major changes were observed in cerebral or SA oxygenation. These results demonstrate that a 10-day hypoxic exposure without any concomitant physical activity had no effect on normoxic or hypoxic V ̇ O 2 peak, despite the enhanced VL oxygenation. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.},

abstract = {Objective: High-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) using a 4 × 1 electrode montage has been previously shown using modeling and physiological studies to constrain the electric field within the spatial extent of the electrodes. The aim of this proof-of-concept study was to determine if functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging can be used to determine a hemodynamic correlate of this 4 × 1 HD-tDCS electric field on the brain. Materials and Methods: In a three session cross-over study design, 13 healthy males received one sham (2 mA, 30 sec) and two real (HD-tDCS-1 and HD-tDCS-2, 2 mA, 10 min) anodal HD-tDCS targeting the left M1 via a 4 × 1 electrode montage (anode on C3 and 4 return electrodes 3.5 cm from anode). The two real HD-tDCS sessions afforded a within-subject replication of the findings. fNIRS was used to measure changes in brain hemodynamics (oxygenated hemoglobin integral-O2Hbint) during each 10 min session from two regions of interest (ROIs) in the stimulated left hemisphere that corresponded to “within” (Lin) and “outside” (Lout) the spatial extent of the 4 × 1 electrode montage, and two corresponding ROIs (Rin and Rout) in the right hemisphere. Results: The ANOVA showed that both real anodal HD-tDCS compared to sham induced a significantly greater O2Hbint in the Lin than Lout ROIs of the stimulated left hemisphere; while there were no significant differences between the real and sham sessions for the right hemisphere ROIs. Intra-class correlation coefficients showed “fair-to-good” reproducibility for the left stimulated hemisphere ROIs. Conclusions: The greater O2Hbint “within” than “outside” the spatial extent of the 4 × 1 electrode montage represents a hemodynamic correlate of the electrical field distribution, and thus provides a prospective reliable method to determine the dose of stimulation that is necessary to optimize HD-tDCS parameters in various applications.},

@article{billaut_cerebral_2010,
abstract = {Aim: The reduction in cerebral oxygenation (Cox) is associated with the cessation of exercise during constant work rate and incremental tests to exhaustion. Yet in exercises of this nature, ecological validity is limited due to work rate being either fully or partly dictated by the protocol, and it is unknown whether cerebral deoxygenation also occurs during self-paced exercise. Here, we investigated the cerebral haemodynamics during a 5-km running time trial in trained runners. Methods: Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and surface electromyogram (EMG) of lower limb muscles were recorded every 0.5 km. Changes in Cox (prefrontal lobe) were monitored via near-infrared spectroscopy through concentration changes in oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin ($\delta$[O 2Hb], $\delta$[HHb]). Changes in total Hb were calculated ($\delta$[THb] = $\delta$[O2Hb] + $\delta$[HHb]) and used as an index of change in regional blood volume. Results: During the trial, RPE increased from 6.6 ± 0.6 to 19.1 ± 0.7 indicating maximal exertion. Cox rose from baseline to 2.5 km (↑$\delta$[O2Hb], ↑$\delta$[HHb], ↑$\delta$[THb]), remained constant between 2.5 and 4.5 km, and fell from 4.5 to 5 km (↓$\delta$[O2Hb], ↑$\delta$[HHb], ↔$\delta$[THb]). Interestingly, the drop in Cox at the end of the trial coincided with a final end spurt in treadmill speed and concomitant increase in skeletal muscle recruitment (as revealed by higher lower limb EMG). Conclusion: Results confirm the large tolerance for change in Cox during exercise at sea level, yet further indicate that, in conditions of self-selected work rate, cerebral deoxygenation remains within a range that does not hinder strenuous exercise performance. {\textcopyright} 2009 Scandinavian Physiological Society.},

abstract = {The potentiated exercise-sweating rate observed during acute hypoxia is diminished after a sleep-high trainlow (SH-TL) regimen. We tested the hypothesis that this attenuation of the sweating response after SH-TL is compensated for by an increase in heat loss via vasodilatation. Nine male subjects participated in a 28-day SH-TL regimen. Before (pre-), and after (post-) the SH-TL protocol, they performed an VO2peak test under normoxia and hypoxia. Additionally, pre- and post-SH-TL they completed three 30-min constant-work rate trials on a cycle ergometer. In one trial, the subjects inspired room air while exercising at 50 % of normoxic VO2peak (CT). In the remaining trials, subjects exercised in hypoxia (FIO2 12.5 %), either at the same absolute (HAT) or relative (50 % of hypoxic VO2 peak) work rate (HRT) as in CT. Despite similar exercise core temperature responses between pre- and post-SH-TL trials, sweating rate was potentiated in HAT pre-SH-TL [CT: 1.97 (0.42); HRT: 1.86 (0.31); HAT: 2.55 (0.53) mg cm-2 min-1; p<0.05]. Post-SH-TL exercise sweating rate was increased for CT, and remained unchanged in HRT and HAT [CT: 2.42 (0.76); HRT: 2.01 (0.33); HAT: 2.59 (0.30) mg cm -2 min-1 Pre-SH-TL, the forearm-fingertip skin temperature difference (Tskf-f) was higher in HAT than in CT and HRT by 3.5°C (p<0.05). The inter-condition differences in Tskf-f were diminished post-SH-TL. In conclusion, the decrease in sweating rate during hypoxic exercise, following a SH-TL regimen, was countered by an increase in vasodilatation (reduced Tskf-f), whereas SH-TL enhanced the sweating response during normoxic exercise. The mechanisms underlying these SH-TL-induced alterations in thermoregulatory responses remain to be settled. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2012.},

So far, different NIRS techniques (e.g. continuous-wave (CW) and spatially, time- and frequency-resolved spectroscopy) have been used for measuring muscle oxygenation during exercise. In the last four years, approximately 160 muscle NIRS articles have been published on different physiological aspects (primarily muscle oxygenation and haemodynamics) of several upper- and lower-limb muscle groups investigated by using mainly two-channel CW and spatially resolved spectroscopy commercial instruments. Unfortunately, in only 15 of these studies were the advantages of using multi-channel instruments exploited. There are still several open questions in the application of NIRS in muscle studies: (i) whether NIRS can be used in subjects with a large fat layer; (ii) the contribution of myoglobin desaturation to the NIRS signal during exercise; (iii) the effect of scattering changes during exercise; and (iv) the effect of changes in skin perfusion, particularly during prolonged exercise.

Methods: Nine men (Mean ± SD; age = 21.9 ± 2.4 years; height = 181.8 ± 11.9 cm; body mass = 85.8 ± 6.2 kg) performed 50 unilateral and bilateral maximal, concentric, isokinetic leg extensions at 180° s−1 on two separate visits. The muscle oxygenation parameters assessed with near-infrared spectroscopy from the dominant leg and isokinetic torque were averaged for 2 consecutive repetitions at 5 repetition intervals. Separate 2 (Condition [Unilateral and Bilateral]) × 10 (Repetition [5–50]) repeated measures ANOVAs were performed to examine mean differences for normalized isokinetic torque and each muscle oxygenation parameter. Intra- and inter-individual differences were examined with polynomial regression analyses. Results: For normalized isokinetic torque, the unilateral condition (56.3 ± 10.5%) exhibited greater performance fatigability than the bilateral condition (45.0 ± 18.7%). Collapsed across Condition, deoxy[heme] exhibited an increase (p < 0.001), while StO2% exhibited a decrease (p < 0.001). The bilateral condition exhibited a more sustained decline in oxy[heme] than the unilateral condition (p = 0.005). Deoxy[heme], oxy[heme], and total[heme] exhibited substantial intra- and inter-individual differences for the fatigue-induced patterns of response. Conclusion: The present findings indicated that the greater performance fatigability for unilateral versus bilateral fatiguing, maximal, isokinetic leg extensions was not attributable to differences in muscle oxygenation. Future studies of muscle oxygenation should report individual and composite fatigue-induced patterns of responses due to the substantial intra- and inter-individual variabilities.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study was to study the effects of cycling and pure concentric and pure eccentric high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) on skeletal muscle (i.e., vastus lateralis) and cerebral oxygenation. Twelve healthy males (n = 12, age 26 ± 1 yr, body mass 78 ± 2 kg, height 176 ± 2 cm, body fat 17 ± 1% of body mass) performed, in a random order, cycling exercise and isokinetic concentric and eccentric exercise. The isokinetic exercises were performed on each randomly selected leg. The muscle and the cerebral oxygenation were assessed by measuring oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, total hemoglobin, and tissue saturation index. During the cycling exercise, participants performed seven sets of seven seconds maximal intensity using a load equal to 7.5% of their body mass while, during isokinetic concentric and eccentric exercise, they were performed seven sets of five maximal muscle contractions. In all conditions, a 15 s rest was adopted between sets. The cycling HIIE caused greater fatigue (i.e., greater decline in fatigue index) compared to pure concentric and pure eccentric isokinetic exercise. Muscle oxygenation was significantly reduced during HIIE in the three exercise modes, with no difference between them. Cerebral oxygenation was affected only marginally during cycling exercise, while no difference was observed between conditions. It is concluded that a greater volume of either concentric or eccentric isokinetic maximal intensity exercise is needed to cause exhaustion which, in turn, may cause greater alterations in skeletal muscle and cerebral oxygenation.},

To this goal, we have reviewed 110 fNIRS articles published in 2016 in the field of cognitive neuroscience, and performed a simulation analysis with synthetic fNIRS data, to optimize the signal filtering step before applying the GLM method for statistical inference. Our results highlight the fact that many papers lack important information, and there is a large variability in the filtering methods used. Our simulations demonstrated that the optimal approach to remove noise and recover the hemodynamic response from fNIRS data in a GLM framework is to use a 1000th order band-pass Finite Impulse Response filter. Based on these results, we give preliminary recommendations as to the first step towards improving the analysis of fNIRS data and dissemination of the results.},

abstract = {Background: Anemia disturbs hemorheological/hemodynamic properties, whereas aerobic interval training (AIT) achieves a superior aerobic fitness in patients with heart failure (HF). This study investigated whether AIT influences functional capacity by modulating hemorheological/hemodynamic functions in HF patients with/without anemia. Methods: Sixty HF patients were divided into non-anemic (HF-NA, hemoglobin≧12 g/dL in women/≧13 g/dL in men; n=30) and anemic (HF-A, hemoglobinb11 g/dL in women/b12 g/dL in men; n=30) groups, and 30 normal counterparts were enrolled as a control group. These HF patients performed AIT (3-minute intervals at 40% and 80%VO2peak) on a bicycle ergometer for 30 min/day, 3 days/week for 12 weeks. Erythrocyte rheological and central/peripheral hemodynamic characteristics were determined by slit-flow ektacytometer and bioreactance-based device/near infrared spectrometer, respectively. Results: In both HF-NA and HF-A groups, the AIT regimen 1) reduced blood senescent/spherical erythrocyte counts, 2) diminished the values of critical shear stresses for disaggregation and half-maximal deformation of erythrocytes, 3) enhanced cardiac output during exercise, 4) heightened VO2peak and O2 uptake efficiency slope (OUES), and 5) decreased plasma myeloperoxidase and interleukin-6 levels. However, AIT increased the amounts of blood distributed to the frontal cerebral lobe and vastus lateralis muscle during exercise in HF-NA group but not in HF-A group. Additionally, HF-A group exhibited fewer the enhancements of VO2peak and OUES caused by AIT than HF-NA group did. Conclusion: AIT improves aerobic capacity and efficiency by depressing aggregability and enhancing deformability of erythrocytes in patients with HF.However, anemic comorbidity attenuates the adaptations of cerebral/muscular hemodynamic responses to exercise following this regimen. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Due to the technical nature of speed skating, that is affecting physiological mechanisms such as oxygenation and blood flow, this sport provides a unique setting allowing us to uncover novel mechanistic insights of the physiological response to exercise in elite middle-distance and endurance sports. The present study aimed to examine the influence of skating mode (short-track vs. long-track) on muscle oxygenation, perceived fatigue, and recovery in elite speed skating. Muscle oxygenation of 12 talented short-track speed skaters was continuously monitored during a long-track (LT) and a short-track (ST) skating time-trial of maximal effort using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) on the m. vastus lateralis for both legs. Video captures were made of each testing session for further interpretation of the muscle oxygenation. To determine recovery, perceived exertion was measured 2 and 4 h after each testing sessions. Repeated measures ANOVA's were used for statistical analysis (p < 0.05). After a rapid desaturation in both legs directly after the start, an asymmetry in muscle oxygenation between both legs was found during LT (tissue saturation-index (TSI%)-slope: left = 0.053 ± 0.032; right = 0.023 ± 0.020, p < 0.05) and ST speed skating (TSI%-slope: left = 0.050 ± 0.052, right = 0.001 ± 0.053, p < 0.05). Resaturation of the right leg was relatively lower in ST compared to LT. For the left leg, no difference was found between skating modes in muscle oxygenation. Respectively, two (ST = 5.8 ± 2.0; LT = 4.2 ± 1.5) and 4 h (ST = 4.6 ± 1.9; LT = 3.1 ± 1.6) after the time-trials, a higher rate of perceived exertion was found for ST. Based on our results, ST seems more physiologically demanding, and longer periods of recovery are needed after training compared to LT. Technical aspects unique to the exercise mode seem to impact on oxygenation, affecting processes related to the regulation of exercise intensity such as fatigue and recovery.},

abstract = {PURPOSE:: To characterize the cardiorespiratory response to exercise before and after aerobic exercise training in patients with interstitial lung disease. METHODS:: We performed a clinical study, examining 13 patients (New York Heart Association/World Health Organization Functional class II or III) before and after 10 weeks of supervised treadmill exercise walking, at 70% to 80% of heart rate reserve, 30 to 45 minutes per session, 3 times a week. Outcome variables included measures of cardiorespiratory function during a treadmill cardiopulmonary exercise test, with additional near infrared spectroscopy measurements of peripheral oxygen extraction and bioimpedance cardiography measurements of cardiac output. Six-minute walk test distance was also measured. RESULTS:: All subjects participated in at least 24 of their 30 scheduled exercise sessions with no significant adverse events. After training, the mean 6-minute walk test distance increased by 52 ± 48 m (P = .001), peak treadmill cardiopulmonary exercise test time increased by 163 ± 130 s (P = .001), and time to achieve gas exchange threshold increased by 145 ± 37 s (P < .001). Despite a negligible increase in peak (Equation is included in full-text article.)o2 with no changes to cardiac output, the overall work rate/(Equation is included in full-text article.)o2 relationship was enhanced after training. Muscle O2 extraction increased by 16% (P = .049) after training. CONCLUSIONS:: Clinically significant improvements in cardiorespiratory function were observed after aerobic exercise training in this group of subjects with interstitial lung disease. These improvements appear to have been mediated by increases in the peripheral extraction of O2 rather than changes in O2 delivery.},

abstract = {Purpose: The current investigation assessed tissue oxygenation and local blood volume in both vastus lateralis muscles during 3000-m race simulations in elite speed skaters on ice and the effects of leg compression on physiological, perceptual, and performance measures. Methods: Ten (6 female) elite ice speed skaters completed 2 on-ice trials with and without leg compression. Tissue oxygenation and local blood volume in both vastus lateralis muscles were assessed with near-infrared spectroscopy. Continuous measures of oxygen uptake, ventilation, heart rate, and velocity were conducted throughout the race simulations, as well as blood lactate concentration and ratings of perceived exertion before and after the trials. In addition, lap times were assessed. Results: The investigation of tissue oxygenation in both vastus lateralis muscles revealed an asymmetry (P < .00; effect size = 1.81) throughout the 3000-m race simulation. The application of leg compression did not affect oxygenation asymmetry (smallest P = .99; largest effect size = 0.31) or local blood volume (P = .33; 0.95). Lap times (P = .88; 0.43), velocity (P = .24; 0.84), oxygen uptake (P = .79; 0.10), ventilation (P = .11; 0.59), heart rate (P = .21; 0.89), blood lactate concentration (P = .82; 0.59), and ratings of perceived exertion (P = .19; 1.01) were also unaffected by the different types of clothing. Conclusion: Elite ice speed skaters show an asymmetry in tissue oxygenation of both vastus lateralis muscles during 3000-m events remaining during the long gliding phases along the straight sections of the track. Based on the data, the authors conclude that there are no performance-enhancing benefits from wearing leg compression under a normal racing suit. {\textcopyright} 2014 Human Kinetics, Inc.},

abstract = {The motivation behind using physiological measures to estimate cognitive activity is typically to build technology that can help people to understand themselves and their work, or indeed for systems to do so and adapt. While functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) has been shown to reliably reflect manipulations of mental workload in different work tasks, we still need to establish whether fNIRS can differentiate variety within common office-like tasks in order to broaden our understanding of the factors involved in tracking them in real working conditions. 20 healthy participants (8 females, 12 males), whose work included office-like tasks, took part in a user study that investigated a) the sensitivity of fNIRS for measuring mental workload variations in representations of everyday reading and writing tasks, and b) how representations of natural interruptions are reflected in the data. Results supported fNIRS measuring PFC activation in differentiating between workload levels for reading tasks but not writing tasks in terms of increased oxygenated haemoglobin (O2Hb) and decreased deoxygenated haemoglobin (HHb), for harder conditions compared to easier conditions. There was considerable support for fNIRS in detecting changes in workload levels due to interruptions. Variations in workload levels during the interruptions could be understood in relation to spare capacity models. These findings may guide future work into sustained monitoring of cognitive activity in real-world settings.},

Since NIRS is anoptical technique, radio frequency (RF) interference from other instruments isunlikely to affect the raw optical data, however, NIRS dataprocessing and signal output could be affected. Methods: We investigatedthe potential for three common OR instruments: an electrical cautery,an orthopaedic drill and an imaging system, to generate electromagneticinterference (EMI) that could potentially influence NIRS signals. The timeof onset and duration of every operation of each devicewas recorded during surgery. To remove the effects of slowchanging physiological variables, we first used a lowpass filter andthen selected 2 windows with variable lengths around the momentof device onset. For each instant, variances (energy) and meansof the signals in the 2 windows were compared. Results:Twenty patients were studied during ankle surgery. Analysis shows nostatistically significant difference in the means and variance of theNIRS signals (p < 0.01) during operation of any ofthe three devices for all surgeries. Conclusion: This method confirmsthe instruments evaluated caused no significant interference. NIRS can potentiallybe used without EMI in clinical environments such as theOR. {\textcopyright}2010 COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

Although severe intermittent hypoxia (IH) is well known to induce deleterious cardiometabolic consequences, moderate IH may induce positive effects in obese individuals. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of two hypoxic conditioning programs on cardiovascular and metabolic health status of overweight or obese individuals. In this randomized single-blind controlled study, 35 subjects (54 ± 9.3 yr, 31.7 ± 3.5 kg/m2) were randomized into three 8-wk interventions (three 1-h sessions per week): sustained hypoxia (SH), arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) = 75%; IH, 5 min SpO2 = 75% – 3 min normoxia; normoxia. Ventilation, heart rate, blood pressure, and tissue oxygenation were measured during the first and last hypoxic conditioning sessions. Vascular function, blood glucose and insulin, lipid profile, nitric oxide metabolites, and oxidative stress were evaluated before and after the interventions. Both SH and IH increased ventilation in hypoxia (+1.8 ± 2.1 and +2.3 ± 3.6 L/min, respectively; P < 0.05) and reduced normoxic diastolic blood pressure (-12 ± 15 and -13 ± 10 mmHg, respectively; P < 0.05), whereas changes in normoxic systolic blood pressure were not significant (+3 ± 9 and -6 ± 13 mmHg, respectively; P > 0.05). IH only reduced heart rate variability (e.g., root-mean-square difference of successive normal R-R intervals in normoxia -21 ± 35%; P < 0.05). Both SH and IH induced no significant change in body mass index, vascular function, blood glucose, insulin and lipid profile, nitric oxide metabolites, or oxidative stress, except for an increase in superoxide dismutase activity following SH. This study indicates that passive hypoxic conditioning in obese individuals induces some positive cardiovascular and respiratory improvements despite no change in anthropometric data and even a reduction in heart rate variability during IH exposure.},

The aim of this study was to assess effects of ingestion of an oxygen supplement (OS) on exercise performance and post-exercise recovery in a group of trained runners. Methods: Trained male runners (n = 25, mean ± SD; age 23 ± 6 years, mass 70 ± 9 kg, BMI 21.9 ± 2.7 kg.m-2 VO2max 64 ± 6mL.kg-1.min-1), completed a randomised double blinded, crossover study to assess the effect of ingestion of OS solution on exercise performance and recovery. Trials consisted of a 30min rest period, 5min warm-up, a 5000m treadmill time-trial, and a 30min passive recovery. Participants ingested 6x15mL of either OS or a taste matched placebo during the trials (3 during the rest phase, 1 during exercise and 2 during the recovery). Muscle tissue O2 saturation was measured via near infrared spectroscopy. Blood lactate concentrations were measured prior to, mid-way and directly after the finish of the 5000m time trials and every 3-min during the post-exercise recovery. Results: Ingestion of OS did not improve exercise performance. No significant differences were observed for muscle tissue O2 saturation at any time-points. However, lactate clearance was significantly improved during recovery in the OS trials. Both AUC (109 ± 32 vs. 123 ± 38 mmol.min, P < 0.05, d = 0.40) and lactate half-life ($\lambda$) (1127 ± 272 vs. 1223 ± 334 s, P < 0.05, d = 0.32) were significantly reduced. Conclusions: Despite no evidence of improved exercise performance, ingestion of OS did enhance post-exercise recovery via increased lactate clearance.},

However, previous studies have focused on caffeine levels much higher than those found in dietary servings and have compared high caffeine consumers with low consumers rather than 'non-consumers'. The current placebo-controlled double-blind, balanced-crossover study employed near infrared spectroscopy to monitor pre-frontal cerebral-haemodynamics at rest and during completion of tasks that activate the pre-frontal cortex. Twenty healthy young habitual and non-habitual consumers of caffeine received 75. mg caffeine or placebo. Caffeine significantly decreased cerebral blood flow but this was subject to a significant interaction with consumption status, with no significant effect being shown in habitual consumers and an exaggerated effect in non-habitual consumers. These findings suggest that caffeine, at levels typically found in a single dietary serving, is able to modulate cerebral blood flow but these effects are subject to tolerance. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We assessed the effects of a 3-min partial-body cryostimulation (PBC) exposure—where the whole body is exposed to extreme cold, except the head—on cognitive inhibition performance and the possible implications of parasympathetic cardiac control and cerebral oxygenation. In a randomized controlled counterbalanced cross-over design, eighteen healthy young adults (nine males and nine females) completed a cognitive Stroop task before and after one single session of PBC (3-min exposure at − 150 °C cold air) and a control condition (3 min at room temperature, 20 °C). During the cognitive task, heart rate variability (HRV) and cerebral oxygenation of the prefrontal cortex were measured using heart rate monitoring and near-infrared spectroscopy methods. We also recorded the cerebral oxygenation during the PBC session. Stroop performance after PBC exposure was enhanced (562.0 ± 40.2 ms) compared to pre-PBC (602.0 ± 56.4 ms; P < 0.042) in males only, accompanied by an increase ( P < 0.05) in HRV indices of parasympathetic tone, in greater proportion in males compared to females. During PBC, cerebral oxygenation decreased in a similar proportion in males and females but the cerebral extraction (deoxyhemoglobin: $\Delta$HHb) remained higher after exposure in males, only. These data demonstrate that a single PBC session enhances the cognitive inhibition performance on a Stroop task in males, partly mediated by a greater parasympathetic cardiac control and greater cerebral oxygenation. The effects of PBC on cognitive function seem different in females, possibly explained by a different sensitivity to cold stimulation.},

abstract = {Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) has recently gained interest both for breast cancer screening and diagnosis. Its employment has increased also in conjunction with digital mammography (DM), to improve cancer detection and reduce false positive recall rate. Synthetic mammograms (SMs) reconstructed from DBT data have been introduced to replace DM in the DBT + DM approach, for preserving the benefits of the dual-acquisition modality whilst reducing radiation dose and compression time. Therefore, different DBT models have been commercialized and the effective potential of each system has been investigated. In particular, wide-angle DBT was shown to provide better depth resolution than narrow-angle DBT, while narrow-angle DBT allows better identification of microcalcifications compared to wide-angle DBT. Given the increasing employment of SMs as supplement to DBT, a comparison of image quality between SMs obtained in narrow-angle and wide-angle DBT is of practical interest. Therefore, the aim of this phantom study was to evaluate and compare the image quality of SMs reconstructed from 15° (SM15) and 40° (SM40) DBT in a commercial system. Spatial resolution, noise and contrast properties were evaluated through the modulation transfer function (MTF), noise power spectrum, maps of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), image contrast, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and contrast-detail (CD) thresholds. SM40 expressed higher MTF than SM15, but also lower SNR and CNR levels. SM15 and SM40 were characterized by slight different texture, and a different behavior in terms of contrast was found. SM15 provided better CD performances than SM40. These results suggest that the employment of wide/narrow-angle DBT + SM images should be optimized based on the specific image task.},

NIRS was used for the quantitative measurement of muscle O2 consumption (mV̇O2) and forearm blood flow (FBF) in 78 healthy subjects. Skinfold thickness ranged from 1.4 to 8.9 mm within the group. Resting mV̇O2 was 0.11±0.04 ml of O2{\textperiodcentered}min-1{\textperiodcentered}100 g-1, and FBF was 1.28±0.82 ml{\textperiodcentered}min-1{\textperiodcentered}100 ml-1.There was a negative correlation (r = -0.70, P ≤ 0.01), indicating a decrease in mV̇O2 with increasing ATT. mV̇O2 in the 10 leanest subjects appeared to be twice as high as that in the 10 subjects with the highest ATT. A poor correlation (r = 0.29, P ≤ 0.01) was found between ATT and FBF. The gender difference that we found for mV̇O2 was due to the difference in ATT between female and male subjects. No correlation was found between maximum voluntary contraction and mV̇O2, nor between maxi mum voluntary contraction and ATT, indicating that the contraction force did not confound our results. These results show that ATT has a substantial confounding influence on in vivo NIRS measurements, and that it is essential to incorporate this factor into future NIRS muscle studies in order to justify comparisons between different groups. To facilitate such comparisons, upper and lower boundaries for normal values of mV̇O2 and FBF in relation to ATT are presented.},

abstract = {During exercise, as end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO2) drops after the respiratory compensation point (RCP), so does cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv) and cerebral oxygenation. This low-flow, low-oxygenation state may limit work capacity. We hypothesized that by preventing the fall in PETCO2 at peak work capacity (Wmax) with a newly designed high-flow, low-resistance rebreathing circuit, we would improve CBFv, cerebral oxygenation, and Wmax. Ten cyclists performed two incremental exercise tests, one as control and one with PETCO2 constant (clamped) after the RCP. We analyzed , middle cerebral artery CBFv, cerebral oxygenation, and cardiopulmonary measures. At Wmax, when we clamped PETCO2 (39.7±5.2mmHg vs. 29.6±4.7mmHg, P<0.001), CBFv increased (92.6±15.9cm/s vs. 73.6±12.5cm/s, P<0.001). However, cerebral oxygenation was unchanged ($\Delta$TSI -21.3±13.1% vs. -24.3±8.1%, P=0.33), and Wmax decreased (380.9±20.4W vs. 405.7±26.8W, P<0.001). At Wmax, clamping PETCO2 increases CBFv, but this does not appear to improve Wmax. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Introduction: Dual-task walking is common in daily life but becomes more difficult with aging. Little is known about the neurobiological mechanisms affecting competing cognitive demands. Translational studies with human and animal models are needed to address this gap. This pilot study investigated the feasibility of implementing a novel cross-species dual-task model in humans and rats and aimed to establish preliminary evidence that the model induces a dual-task cost. Methods: Young and older humans and rats performed an object discrimination task (OD), a baseline task of typical walking (baseline), an alternation turning task on a Figure 8 walking course (Alt), and a dual-task combining object discrimination with the alternation task (AltOD). Primary behavioral assessments including walking speed and correct selections for object discrimination and turning direction. In humans, left prefrontal cortex activity was measured with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Results: Human subjects generally performed well on all tasks, but the older adults exhibited a trend for a slowing of walking speed immediately before the turning decision for Alt and AltOD compared to baseline. Older adults also had heightened prefrontal activity relative to young adults for the Alt and AltOD tasks. Older rodents required more training than young rodents to learn the alternation task. When tested on AltOD with and without a 15-s delay between trials, older rodents exhibited a substantial performance deficit for the delayed version on the initial day of testing. Old rats, however, did not show a significant slowing in walking speed with increasing task demand, as was evident in the young rats. Discussion: This study demonstrates the feasibility and challenges associated with implementing a cross-species dual-task model. While there was preliminary evidence of dual-task cost in both humans and rats, the magnitude of effects was small and not consistent across species. This is likely due to the relative ease of each task in humans and the walking component in rats not being sufficiently challenging. Future versions of this test should make the cognitive tasks more challenging and the motor task in rats more complex.},

abstract = {Background:Cerebral autoregulation (CAR) systems maintain blood flow to the brain across a wide range of blood pressures. Deficits in CAR have been linked to gait speed but previous studies had small sample sizes and used specialised equipment which impede clinical translation. The purpose of this work was to assess the association between gait speed and orthostatic cerebral oxygenation in a large, community-dwelling sample of older adults. Methods: Data for this study came from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing. A near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) device attached to the forehead of each participant (n=2708) was used to track tissue saturation index (TSI; the ratio of oxygenated to total haemoglobin) during standing. Gait speed (GS) was assessed using a portable walkway. Results: Recovery was impaired in slower GS participants with a TSI value at 20 seconds (after standing) of -0.55% (95% CI: -0.67, -0.42) below baseline in the slowest GS quartile versus -0.14% (95% CI: -0.25, -0.04) in the fastest quartile. Slower GS predicted a lower TSI throughout the 3-minute monitoring period. Results were not substantially altered by adjusting for orthostatic hypotension. Adjustment for clinical and demographic covariates attenuated the association between but differences remained between GS quartiles from 20 seconds to 3 minutes after standing. Conclusion: This study reported evidence for impaired recovery of orthostatic cerebral oxygenation depending on gait speed in community-dwelling older adults. Future work assessing NIRS as a clinical tool for monitoring the relationship between gait speed and cerebral regulation is warranted.},

Self-reports of flow (using a flow feelings scale) and attention (using thought probes), autonomic activity (heart rate, heart rate variability, and breathing rate), and cerebral oxygenation (using near-infrared spectroscopy) in two regions of the frontoparietal attention network (right lateral frontal cortex and right inferior parietal lobe) were measured during the practice of two simple video games (Tetris and Pong) played at different difficulty conditions (easy, optimal, hard, or self-selected). Our results indicated that an optimal level of difficulty, compared with an easy or hard level of difficulty led to greater flow feelings and a higher concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin in the regions of the frontoparietal network. The self-selected, named autonomy condition did not lead to more flow feelings than the optimal condition; however, the autonomy condition led to greater sympathetic activity (reduced heart rate variability and greater breathing rate) and higher activation of the frontoparietal regions. Our study suggests that flow feelings are highly connected to the mobilization of attentional resources, and all the more in a condition that promotes individuals' choice and autonomy.},

Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has been used to examine prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity while walking, but the relationship between PFC activity and turn performance remains unclear. The aim of this pilot study was to examine PFC activity during turning in PD and healthy controls, and to investigate the association between PFC activity and turning. Thirty-two subjects, 15 freezers (PD + FoG) and 17 non-freezers (PD − FoG), and 8 controls were asked to perform a 2-min turning-in-place test under single-task (ST) and dual-task (DT) conditions. Each participant wore an fNIRS system to measure changes in oxyhemoglobin, as measure of PFC activity, and inertial sensors to quantify turning. Our results show a significant group (p = .050), task (p = .039), and interaction (p = .047) for the PFC activity during turning. Specifically, PD + FoG show higher PFC during turning compared to the other groups; PFC activity during DT is overall different compared to ST with an opposite trend in PD + FoG compared to controls and PD − FoG. In addition, higher PFC is associated with worse FoG in PD + FoG (r = 0.57, p = .048) and with lower number of turns in PD − FoG (r = − 0.70, p = .002). The increased PFC activity in PD and the association between higher PFC activity and poorer turning performance may be a sign of poor movement automaticity in PD. Although further investigations are required, these pilot findings may guide development of personalized treatments to improve motor automaticity in PD.},

abstract = {Purpose: It has been shown that an inspiratory muscle warm-up (IMW) could enhance performance. IMW may also improve the near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-derived tissue oxygen saturation index (TSI) during cycling. However, there exists contradictory data about the effect of this conditioning strategy on performance and muscle oxygenation. We examined the effect of IMW on speed skating performance and studied the underpinning physiological mechanisms related to muscle oxygenation. Methods: In a crossover, randomized, single-blind study, eight elite speed skaters performed 3000 m on-ice time trials, preceded by either IMW (2 × 30 breaths, 40% maximal inspiratory pressure) or SHAM (2 × 30 breaths, 15% maximal inspiratory pressure). Changes in TSI, oxyhemoglobin–oxymyoglobin ([O 2 HbMb]), deoxyhemoglobin–deoxymyoglobin ([HHbMb]), total hemoglobin–myoglobin ([THbMb]) and HHbMbdiff ([O 2 HbMb]–[HHbMb]) in the right vastus lateralis muscle were monitored by NIRS. All variables were compared at different time points of the race simulation with repeated-measures analysis of variance. Differences between IMW and SHAM were also analyzed using Cohen's effect size (ES) ± 90% confidence limits, and magnitude-based inferences. Results: Compared with SHAM, IMW had no clear impact on skating time (IMW 262.88 ± 17.62 s vs. SHAM 264.05 ± 21.12 s, effect size (ES) 0.05; 90% confidence limits, − 0.22, 0.32, p = 0.7366), TSI, HbMbdiff, [THbMb], [O 2 HbMb] and perceptual responses. Conclusions: IMW did not modify skating time during a 3000 m time trial in speed skaters, in the conditions of our study. The unchanged [THbMb] and TSI demonstrate that the mechanisms by which IMW could possibly exert an effect on performance were unaffected by this intervention.},

@article{gollie_fatigability_2017,
abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of the present study was to characterize hypothesized relationships among fatigability and cardiorespiratory fitness in individuals with chronic motor-incomplete SCI (iSCI) during treadmill walking. The theoretical framework was that exacerbated fatigability would occur concomitantly with diminished cardiorespiratory fitness in people with iSCI. Methods: Subjects with iSCI (n = 8) and an able-bodied reference group (REF) (n = 8) completed a 6-min walking bout followed by a walking bout of 30-min or until volitional exhaustion, both at a self-selected walking speed. Fatigability was assessed using both perceived fatigability and performance fatigability measures. Pulmonary oxygen uptake kinetics (VO2 on-kinetics) was measured breath-by-breath and changes in deoxygenated hemoglobin/myoglobin concentration (∆[HHb]) of the lateral gastrocnemius was measured by near-infrared spectroscopy. Adjustment of VO2 and ∆[HHb] on-kinetics were modeled using a mono-exponential equation. Results: Perceived fatigability and performance fatigability were 52% and 44% greater in the iSCI group compared to the REF group (p = 0.003 and p = 0.004). Phase II time constant ($\tau$p) of VO2 on-kinetics and ∆[HHb] ½ time during resting arterial occlusion were 55.4% and 16.3% slower in iSCI vs REF (p < 0.01 and p = 0.047, respectively). Conclusions: The results of the present study may suggest that compromised O2 delivery and/or utilization may have contributed to the severity of fatigability in these individuals with iSCI. The understanding of the extent to which fatigability and VO2 and $\Delta$[HHb] on-kinetics impacts locomotion after iSCI will assist in the future development of targeted interventions to enhance function.},

abstract = {Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is gaining popularity in detection and classification of cognitive and emotional states. In addition to hemodynamic responses arising from functional activity changes in the brain areas of interest, fNIRS signals contain components related to other physiological processes, such as respiration (frequency oscillations around 0.3 Hz) and cardiac pulsation (around 1 Hz). While heart rate and respiration measures have been successfully used as separate modalities to assess mental workload, these components are often discarded in fNIRS studies during the pre-processing. In this study, we examined whether including features related to heart and breathing rate improves the accuracy of mental workload level classification. Data collected with wearable fNIRS devices from 14 healthy participants performing mental workload task (n-back) were used to extract features for the classification. Machine learning classifiers were trained and tested using conventional features separately and in combination with the features derived from the oscillatory activity of respiration and heart pulsation. By comparing the performance, we demonstrated the effect of including proposed features on the classification accuracy of mental workload. In future studies, the examined features might be beneficial for other classification problems where modulations in heart and breathing rates are expected.},

abstract = {Objective: To test the extent to which initial walking speed influences dual-task performance after walking intervention, hypothesising that slow walking speed affects automatic gait control, limiting executive resource availability. Design: A secondary analysis of a trial of dual-task (DT) and single-task (ST) walking interventions comparing those with good (walking speed ⩾0.8 m s−1, n = 21) and limited (walking speed <0.79 m s−1, n = 24) capacity at baseline. Setting: Community. Subjects: Adults six-months post stroke with walking impairment. Interventions: Twenty sessions of 30 minutes treadmill walking over 10 weeks with (DT) or without (ST) cognitive distraction. Good and limited groups were formed regardless of intervention received. Main measures: A two-minute walk with (DT) and without (ST) a cognitive distraction assessed walking. fNIRS measured prefrontal cortex activation during treadmill walking with (DT) and without (ST) Stroop and planning tasks and an fMRI sub-study used ankle-dorsiflexion to simulate walking. Results: ST walking improved in both groups (∆baseline: Good = 8.9 ± 13.4 m, limited = 5.3±8.9 m, Group × time = P < 0.151) but only the good walkers improved DT walking (∆baseline: Good = 10.4 ± 13.9 m, limited = 1.3 ± 7.7 m, Group × time = P < 0.025). fNIRS indicated increased ispilesional prefrontal cortex activation during DT walking following intervention (P = 0.021). fMRI revealed greater DT cost activation for limited walkers, and increased resting state connectivity of contralesional M1 with cortical areas associated with conscious gait control at baseline. After the intervention, resting state connectivity between ipsilesional M1 and bilateral superior parietal lobe, involved in integrating sensory and motor signals, increased in the good walkers compared with limited walkers. Conclusion: In individual who walk slowly it may be difficult to improve dual-task walking ability. Registration: ISRCTN50586966},

We hypothesized that online HD-atDCS would have a greater effect on task-related sensorimotor cortex activation than offline HD-atDCS.

Functional near-infrared spectroscopy hemodynamic changes were measured from the left sensorimotor cortex during a simple finger opposition motor task before (Pre), immediately (T1) and 30 min after (T2) each session. The movement rates were not different between (online, offline, sham) or within (Pre, T1, T2) sessions. At T2, online HD-atDCS was associated with a significant increase (large effect size) in sensorimotor cortex activation (Hedges g = 1.01, p < 0.001) when compared to sham; there was a nonsignificant trend to increase activation between offline and sham (Hedges g = 0.52, p = 0.05) and between online and offline (Hedges g = 0.53, p = 0.06).

abstract = {Background: Accumulating evidence suggests that gait is influenced by higher order cognitive and cortical control mechanisms. Recently, several studies used functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to examine brain activity during walking, demonstrating increased oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO 2) levels in the frontal cortex during walking while subjects completed a verbal cognitive task. It is, however, still unclear whether this increase in activation was related to verbalization, if the response was specific to gait, or if it would also be observed during standing, a different motor control task. The aim of this study was to investigate whether an increase in frontal activation is specific to dual tasking during walking. Methods. Twenty-three healthy young adults (mean 30.9 ± 3.7 yrs, 13 females) were assessed using an electronic walkway. Frontal brain activation was assessed using an fNIRS system consisting of two probes placed on the forehead of the subjects. Assessments included: walking in a self-selected speed; walking while counting forward; walking while serially subtracting 7s (Walking+S7); and standing while serially subtracting 7s (Standing+S7). Data was collected from 5 walks of 30 meters in each condition. Twenty seconds of quiet standing before each walk served as baseline frontal lobe activity. Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (RM ANOVA) tested for differences between the conditions. Results: Significant differences were observed in HbO2 levels between all conditions (p = 0.007). HbO2 levels appeared to be graded; walking alone demonstrated the lowest levels of HbO2 followed by walking+counting condition (p = 0.03) followed by Walking+S7 condition significantly increased compared to the two other walking conditions (p < 0.01). No significant differences in HbO2 levels were observed between usual walking and the standing condition (p = 0.38) or between standing with or without serial subtraction (p = 0.76). Conclusions: This study provides direct evidence that dual tasking during walking is associated with frontal brain activation in healthy young adults. The observed changes are apparently not a response to the verbalization of words and are related to the cognitive load during gait. {\textcopyright} 2014 Mirelman et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare cardiovascular hemodynamics and cerebral oxygenation/perfusion (COP) during and after maximal incremental exercise in obese individuals according to their aerobic fitness versus age-matched healthy controls (AMHC). Fifty-four middle–aged obese (OB) and 16 AMHC were recruited. Maximal cardiopulmonary function (gas exchange analysis), cardiac hemodynamics (impedance cardiography), and left frontal COP (near-infrared spectroscopy: NIRS) were measured continuously during a maximal incremental ergocycle test. During recovery, reoxygenation/perfusion rate (ROPR: oxyhemoglobin: $\Delta$O2Hb, deoxyhemoglobin: $\Delta$HHb and total hemoglobin: $\Delta$tHb; with NIRS) was also measured. Obese participants (OB, n = 54) were divided into two groups according to the median peak: the low-fit obese (LF-OB, n = 27) and the high-fit obese (HF-OB, n = 27). During exercise, end tidal pressure of CO2 (PETCO2), and COP ($\Delta$O2Hb, $\Delta$HHb and $\Delta$tHb) did not differ between groups (OB, LF-OB, HF-OB, AMHC). During recovery, PETCO2 and ROPR ($\Delta$O2Hb, $\Delta$HHb and $\Delta$tHb) were similar between the groups (OB, LF-OB, HF-OB, AMHC). During exercise and recovery, cardiac index was lower (P < 0.05) in LF-OB versus the other two groups (HF-OB, AMHC). As well, systolic blood pressure was higher during exercise in the OB, LF-OB and HF-OB groups versus AMHC (P < 0.05). When compared to AMHC, obese individuals (OB, LF-OB, HF-OB) have a similar cerebral vasoreactivity by CO2 and cerebral hemodynamics during exercise and recovery, but a higher systolic blood pressure during exercise. Higher fitness in obese subjects (HF-OB) seems to preserve their cardiopulmonary and cardiac function during exercise and recovery.},

abstract = {Dementia cognitive decline vascular cognitive impairment functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) A B S T R A C T The commonest causes of dementia are Alzheimer's disease and vascular cognitive impairment. Although these conditions have been viewed as distinct entities, there is increasing evidence that neurodegenerative and vascular pathologies interact or overlap to cause cognitive decline, and that at least in some cases individuals at risk of cognitive decline exhibit abnormal cardiovascular physiology long before emergence of disease. However, the mechanisms linking haemodynamic disturbances with cognitive impairment and the various pathologies that cause dementia are poorly understood. A sub-sample of 502 participants from the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) have participated in the first visit of a neuroscience sub-study referred to as Insight 46, where clinical, cognitive, imaging, and lifestyle data have been collected for the purpose of elucidating the pathological changes preceding dementia. This paper outlines the cardiovascular phenotyping performed in the follow-up visit of Insight 46, with the study participants now aged 74. In addition to standard cardiovascular assessments such as blood pressure measurements, echocardiography, and electrocardiography (ECG), functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) has been included to provide an assessment of cerebrovascular function. A detailed description of the fNIRS protocol along with preliminary results from pilot data is presented. The combination of lifestyle data, brain structure/ function, cognitive performance, and cardiovascular health obtained not only from Insight 46, but also from the whole NSHD provides an exciting opportunity to advance our understanding of the cardiovascular mechanisms underlying dementia and cognitive decline, and identify novel targets for intervention.

abstract = {We aimed at investigating the effect of a short time low load repetitive task on the local muscle oxygenation kinetics in presence of delayed onset muscle soreness. Computer work was investigated as a model of low load repetitive task. Nine healthy male subjects participated in an experimental protocol consisting of a rest period and two blocks, each including two maximum voluntary contractions (MVC) of isometric bilateral shoulder elevation and a computer work session with 2 or 5 min duration between the MVCs in each block. Then a set of unaccustomed eccentric exercise (ECC) of shoulder elevation was implemented to induce delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) in the trapezius muscle. Identical experimental blocks were performed immediately and 24 h after ECC. Local tissue saturation index (TSI) was continuously recorded over upper trapezius throughout the experiment. TSI parameters such as mean TSI at rest, during computer work as well as TSI drop, recovery and their descending and ascending slopes were computed following the MVCs. TSI drop and recovery and their corresponding descending and ascending slopes were reduced immediately after ECC (p < 0.05). The computer work caused an increase in TSI at rest prior to the MVCs (p < 0.05) and elevated oxygen consumption (p < 0.05). The observed changes in oxygenation kinetics seemed to appear after a strenuous exercise and they do not seem to be affected by the presence of DOMS. However, computer work as a model of low load repetitive task caused increased oxygen consumption in a following bout of muscle contraction.},

abstract = {Key points: Increased plasma nitrite concentrations may have beneficial effects on skeletal muscle function. The physiological basis explaining these observations has not been clearly defined and it may involve positive effects on muscle contraction force, microvascular O2 delivery and skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism. In the isolated canine gastrocnemius model, we evaluated the effects of acute nitrite infusion on muscle force and skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism. Under hypoxic conditions, but in the presence of normal convective O2 delivery, an elevated plasma nitrite concentration affects neither muscle force, nor muscle contractile economy. In accordance with previous results suggesting limited or no effects of nitrate/nitrite administrations in highly oxidative and highly perfused muscle, our data suggest that neither mitochondrial respiration, nor muscle force generation are affected by acute increased concentrations of NO precursors in hypoxia. Abstract: Contrasting findings have been reported concerning the effects of augmented nitric oxide (NO) on skeletal muscle force production and oxygen consumption ((Formula presented.)). The present study examined skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration and contractile economy in an isolated muscle preparation during hypoxia (but normal convective O2 delivery) with nitrite infusion. Isolated canine gastrocnemius muscles in situ (n = 8) were studied during 3 min of electrically stimulated isometric tetanic contractions corresponding to ∼35% of (Formula presented.). During contractions, sodium nitrite (NITRITE) or sodium chloride (SALINE) was infused into the popliteal artery. (Formula presented.) was calculated from the Fick principle. Experiments were carried out in hypoxia ((Formula presented.) = 0.12), whereas convective O2 delivery was maintained at normal levels under both conditions by pump-driven blood flow ((Formula presented.)). Muscle biopsies were taken and mitochondrial respiration was evaluated by respirometry. Nitrite infusion significantly increased both nitrite and nitrate concentrations in plasma. No differences in force were observed between conditions. (Formula presented.) was not significantly different between NITRITE (6.1 ± 1.8 mL (Formula presented.) 100 g−1 min−1) and SALINE (6.2 ± 1.8 mL 100 g−1 min−1), even after being ‘normalized' per unit of developed force (muscle contractile economy). No differences between conditions were found for maximal ADP-stimulated mitochondrial respiration (both for complex I and complex II), leak respiration and oxidative phosphorylation coupling. In conclusion, in the absence of changes in convective O2 delivery, muscle force, muscle contractile economy and mitochondrial respiration were not affected by acute infusion of nitrite. The previously reported positive effects of elevated plasma nitrite concentrations are presumably mediated by the increased microvascular O2 availability.},

abstract = {In Alzheimer's disease (AD) cerebrovascular function is at risk. Transcranial Doppler, near-infrared spectroscopy, and photoplethysmography are noninvasive methods to continuously measure changes in cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV), cerebral cortical oxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb), and blood pressure (BP). In 21 patients with mild to moderate AD and 20 age-matched controls, we investigated how oscillations in cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) and O2Hb are associated with spontaneous and induced oscillations in blood pressure (BP) at the very low (VLF = 0.05 Hz) and low frequencies (LF = 0.1 Hz). We applied spectral and transfer function analysis to quantify dynamic cerebral autoregulation and brain tissue oxygenation. In AD, cerebrovascular resistance was substantially higher (34%, AD vs. control: $\delta$ = 0.69 (0.25) mm Hg/cm/second, p = 0.012) and the transmission of very low frequency (VLF) cerebral blood flow (CBF) oscillations into O2Hb differed, with increased phase lag and gain ($\delta$ phase 0.32 [0.15] rad; $\delta$ gain 0.049 [0.014] $\mu$mol/cm/second, p both < 0.05). The altered transfer of CBF to cortical oxygenation in AD indicates that properties of the cerebral microvasculature are changed in this disease. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the acute vascular and oxygenation responses to repeated sprint exercise during arm cycling with either blood flow restriction (BFR) or systemic hypoxia alone or in combination. Design: The study design was a single-blinded repeated-measures assessment of four conditions with two levels of normobaric hypoxia (400 m and 3800 m) and two levels of BFR (0% and 45% of total occlusion). Methods: Sixteen active participants (eleven men and five women; mean ± SD; 26.4 ± 4.0 years old; 73.8 ± 9.8 kg; 1.79 ± 0.07 m) completed 5 sessions (1 familiarization, 4 conditions). During each test visit, participants performed a repeated sprint arm cycling test to exhaustion (10 s maximal sprints with 20 s recovery until exhaustion) to measure power output, metabolic equivalents, blood flow, as well as oxygenation (near-infrared spectroscopy) of the biceps brachii muscle tissue. Results: Repeated sprint performance was decreased with both BFR and systemic hypoxia conditions. Greater changes between minimum-maximum of sprints in total hemoglobin concentration ($\Delta$[tHb]) were demonstrated with BFR (400 m, 45% and 3800 m, 45%) than without (400 m, 0% and 3800 m, 0%) (p < 0.001 for both). Additionally, delta tissue saturation index ($\Delta$TSI) decreased more with both BFR conditions than without (p < 0.001 for both). The absolute maximum TSI was progressively reduced with both BFR and systemic hypoxia (p < 0.001). Conclusions: By combining high-intensity, repeated sprint exercise with BFR and/or systemic hypoxia, there is a robust stimulus detected by increased changes in blood perfusion placed on specific vascular mechanisms, which were more prominent in BFR conditions.},

@article{hesford_asymmetry_2012,
abstract = {PURPOSE: It has been suggested that, because of the low sitting position in short-track speed skating, muscle blood flow is restricted, leading to decreases in tissue oxygenation. Therefore, wearable wireless-enabled near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technology was used to monitor changes in quadriceps muscle blood volume and oxygenation during a 500-m race simulation in short-track speed skaters. METHODS: Six elite skaters, all of Olympic standard (age = 23 ± 1.8 yr, height = 1.8 ± 0.1 m, mass = 80.1 ± 5.7 kg, midthigh skinfold thickness = 7 ± 2 mm), were studied. Subjects completed a 500-m race simulation time trial (TT). Whole-body oxygen consumption was simultaneously measured with muscle oxygenation in right and left vastus lateralis as measured by NIRS. RESULTS: Mean time for race completion was 44.8 ± 0.4 s. V̇O 2 peaked 20 s into the race. In contrast, muscle tissue oxygen saturation (TSI%) decreased and plateaued after 8 s. Linear regression analysis showed that right leg TSI% remained constant throughout the rest of the TT (slope value = 0.01), whereas left leg TSI% increased steadily (slope value = 0.16), leading to a significant asymmetry (P < 0.05) in the final lap. Total muscle blood volume decreased equally in both legs at the start of the simulation. However, during subsequent laps, there was a strong asymmetry during cornering; when skaters traveled solely on the right leg, there was a decrease in its muscle blood volume, whereas an increase was seen in the left leg. CONCLUSIONS: NIRS was shown to be a viable tool for wireless monitoring of muscle oxygenation. The asymmetry in muscle desaturation observed on the two legs in short-track speed skating has implications for training and performance. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the American College of Sports Medicine.},

abstract = {Elderly patients with heart failure are at risk of postprandial hypotension (PPH), orthostatic hypotension (OH), and concomitant cerebral oxygenation changes because of altered cardiovascular balance and the use of cardiovascular medications, such as furosemide and captopril. In 24 patients with heart failure (New York Heart Association class II to III, in stable condition, and receiving cardiovascular medication [aged 70 to 83 years]), blood pressure (BP) was measured by Finapres, and cortical concentrations of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin were measured using near-infrared spectroscopy during standing and after a 292-kcal carbohydrate meal. Tests were performed before and during therapy with furosemide 40 mg once daily (n = 11) or captopril 6.25 and 12.5 mg twice daily (n = 13) in a double-blind randomized trial. Before treatment, 13 of 24 patients had PPH, and 2 of 24 patients had OH. The first dose of furosemide significantly decreased postprandial systolic BP (p <0.05) and postprandial frontal cortical oxygenation (p <0.05), whereas the first dose of captopril did not. Furosemide and captopril did not significantly affect postprandial or orthostatic BP or cortical oxygenation after 2 weeks of treatment. Thus, PPH is a common phenomenon in elderly patients with heart failure, whereas OH is not. The first dose of furosemide 40 mg decreased postprandial systolic BP and frontal cortical oxygenation, in contrast with the first dose of captopril 6.25 mg and 2-week treatment with furosemide 40 mg once daily or captopril 12.5 mg twice daily. These findings indicate that initiating furosemide treatment worsens PPH, and furosemide is less safe in elderly patients with heart failure. {\textcopyright} 2002 by Excerpta Medica, Inc.},

In order to determine changes in muscle oxygenation during effort in patients with Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) and assess the parameters' links with disease severity and functional status, 10 BMD patients and 10 age-matched controls performed isokinetic, constant-load knee extension exercises at (i) 20% of their extensors' peak torque (i.e. the same relative load) and (ii) the same absolute load (20. Nm). Muscle oxygenation was evaluated noninvasively using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), with the time course of deoxygenation as the main criterion. As expected, BMD patients displayed a lower peak torque than controls (-62%). During both types of exercise, initial muscle deoxygenation was faster (by 27-41%) in BMD patients than in controls. Greater disease severity (according to the Motor Function Measure) and functional impairment (walking endurance) were associated with a faster second deoxygenation phase (. $\tau$). The validity and relevance of muscle deoxygenation parameters and the alteration of vasodilatation by nNOS deficiency in dystrophinopathies should be assessed by further studies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Background: Exercise can improve muscle function and mobility in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the effects of exercise training on skeletal muscle oxidative capacity and endurance in people with MS remain unclear, and few studies have evaluated muscle plasticity in people with MS who have moderate-to-severe disability. The present study evaluated the effects of treadmill training on muscle oxidative capacity and muscle endurance and examined the relationship to walking function in people with MS who have moderate-to-severe disability. Methods: Six adults (mean ± SD age, 50 ± 4.9 years) with MS (Expanded Disability Status Scale score, 6.0-6.5) performed treadmill training for 24 minutes approximately twice per week for approximately 8 weeks (16 sessions total) using an antigravity treadmill system. The following measures were taken before and after the intervention phase: muscle oxidative capacity in the medial gastrocnemius using near-infrared spectroscopy after 15 to 20 seconds of electrical stimulation; muscle endurance in the medial gastrocnemius using accelerometer-based mechanomyography during 9 minutes of twitch electrical stimulation in three stages (3 minutes per stage) of increasing frequency (2, 4, and 6 Hz); and walking function using the 2-Minute Walk Test. Results: Mean ± SD muscle oxidative capacity increased from 0.64 ± 0.19 min-1 to 1.08 ± 0.52 min-1 (68.2%). Mean ± SD muscle endurance increased from 80.9% ± 15.2% to 91.5% ± 4.8% at 2 Hz, from 56.3% ± 20.1% to 76.6% ± 15.8% at 4 Hz, and from 29.2% ± 13.1% to 53.9% ± 19.4% at 6 Hz of stimulation in the gastrocnemius. There were no significant improvements in walking function. Conclusions: Treadmill training can improve muscle oxidative capacity and endurance in people with MS who have moderate-to-severe levels of disability.},

abstract = {We examined the effects of hypoxia severity on peripheral versus central determinants of exercise performance. Eight cyclists performed constant-load exercise to exhaustion at various fractions of inspired O2 fraction (FIO2 0.21/0.15/0.10). At task failure (pedal frequency < 70% target) arterial hypoxaemia was surreptitiously reversed via acute O2 supplementation (FIO2=0.30) and subjects were encouraged to continue exercising. Peripheral fatigue was assessed via changes in potentiated quadriceps twitch force ($\Delta$ Qtw,pot) as measured pre- versus post-exercise in response to supramaximal femoral nerve stimulation. At task failure in normoxia (haemoglobin saturation (SpO2) ∼94%, 656 ± 82 s) and moderate hypoxia (SpO2 ∼82%, 278 ± 16 s), hyperoxygenation had no significant effect on prolonging endurance time. However, following task failure in severe hypoxia (SpO2 ∼67%; 125 ± 6 s), hyperoxygenation elicited a significant prolongation of time to exhaustion (171 ± 61%). The magnitude of $\Delta$ Qtw,pot at exhaustion was not different among the three trials (-35% to -36%, P=0.8). Furthermore, quadriceps integrated EMG, blood lactate, heart rate, and effort perceptions all rose significantly throughout exercise, and to a similar extent at exhaustion following hyperoxygenation at all levels of arterial oxygenation. Since hyperoxygenation prolonged exercise time only in severe hypoxia, we repeated this trial and assessed peripheral fatigue following task failure prior to hyperoxygenation (125 ± 6 s). Although Qtw,pot was reduced from pre-exercise baseline (-23%; P < 0.01), peripheral fatigue was substantially less (P < 0.01) than that observed at task failure in normoxia and moderate hypoxia. We conclude that across the range of normoxia to severe hypoxia, the major determinants of central motor output and exercise performance switches from a predominantly peripheral origin of fatigue to a hypoxia-sensitive central component of fatigue, probably involving brain hypoxic effects on effort perception. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.

abstract = {Introduction: Executive functions play a fundamental role in walking by integrating information from cognitive-motor pathways. Subtle changes in brain and behavior may help identify older adults who are more susceptible to executive function deficits with advancing age due to prefrontal cortex deterioration. This study aims to examine how older adults mitigate executive demands while walking during cognitively demanding tasks. Methods: Twenty healthy older adults (M = 71.8 years, SD = 6.4) performed simple reaction time (SRT), go/no-go (GNG), n-back (NBK), and double number sequence (DNS) cognitive tasks of increasing difficulty while walking (i.e., dual task). Functional near infra-red spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to measure the hemodynamic response (i.e., oxy- [HbO2] and deoxyhemoglobin [HbR]) changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during dual and single tasks (i.e., walking alone). In addition, performance was measured using gait speed (m/s), response time (s), and accuracy (% correct). Results: Using repeated measures ANOVAs, neural findings demonstrated a main effect of task such that ∆HbO2 (p =.047) and ∆HbR (p =.040) decreased between single and dual tasks. An interaction between task and cognitive difficulty (p =.014) revealed that gait speed decreased in the DNS between single and dual tasks. A main effect of task in response time indicated that the SRT response time was faster than all other difficulty levels (p <.001). Accuracy performance declined between single and dual tasks (p =.028) and across difficulty levels (p <.001) but was not significantly different between the NBK and DNS. Conclusion: Findings suggest that a healthy older adult sample might mitigate executive demands using an automatic locomotor control strategy such that shifting conscious attention away from walking during the dual tasks resulted in decreased ∆HbO2 and ∆HbR. However, decreased prefrontal activation was inefficient at maintaining response time and accuracy performance and may be differently affected by increasing cognitive demands.},

abstract = {Background and Purpose - Patients with orthostatic hypotension due to sympathetic failure become symptomatic when standing, although their capability to maintain cerebral blood flow is reported to be preserved. We tested the hypothesis that in patients with sympathetic failure, orthostatic symptoms reflect reduced cerebral perfusion with insufficient oxygen supply. Methods - This study addressed the relationship between orthostatic tolerance, mean cerebral artery blood velocity (V(mean), determined by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography), oxygenation (oxyhemoglobin [O2Hb], determined by near-infrared spectroscopy), and mean arterial pressure at brain level (MAP(MCA), determined by finger arterial pressure monitoring [Finapres]) in 9 patients (aged 37 to 70 years; 4 women) and their age- and sex-matched controls during 5 minutes of standing. Results - Supine MAP(MCA) (108±14 versus 86±14 mm Hg) and V(mean) (84±21 versus 62±13 cm {\textperiodcentered} s-1) were higher in the patients. After 5 minutes of standing, MAP(MCA) was lower in the patients (31±14 versus 72±14 mm Hg) as was V(mean) (51±8 versus 59±9 cm {\textperiodcentered} s-1), with a larger reduction in O2Hb (-11.6±4 versus - 6.7±4.5 $\mu$mol {\textperiodcentered} L-1). Four patients terminated standing after 1 to 3.5 minutes. In these symptomatic patients, the orthostatic fall in V(mean) was greater (45±6 versus 64±10 cm {\textperiodcentered} s-1), and the orthostatic decrease in O2Hb (-12.0±3.3 versus -7.6±3.9 $\mu$mol {\textperiodcentered} L-1) tended to be larger. The reduction in MAP(MCA) was larger after 10 seconds of standing, and MAP(MCA) was lower after 1 minute (25±8 versus 40±6 mm Hg). Conclusions - In patients with sympathetic failure, the orthostatic reduction in cerebral blood velocity and oxygenation is larger. Patients who become symptomatic within 5 minutes of standing are characterized by a pronounced orthostatic fall in blood pressure, cerebral blood velocity, and oxygenation manifest within the first 10 seconds of standing.},

@article{Brandon2020,
abstract = {Military performance depends on high-level cognition, specifically executive function (EF), while simultaneously performing strenuous exercise. However, most studies examine cognitive performance following, not during, exercise. Therefore, our aim was to examine the relationship between EF and exercise intensity. Following familiarization, 13 Reserve Officers' Training Corp cadets (age = 19.6 + 2 yr, five women) completed a graded exercise test (GxT) and two executive function exercise tests (EFETs) separated by a duration of >24 h. The EFET was a combined iPad-based EF test (Cedar Operator Workload Assessment Tool) and GxT. Heart rate (HR) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) oxygenation [near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)] were continuously recorded. The EF score was analyzed for accuracy of responses (%hit rate). Heart rate reserve was calculated to normalize exercise intensity (%HRR). For PFC oxygenation recordings, NIRS variables were used to calculate the tissue saturation index (%TSI). Data from EFET trials were averaged into a singular response. The %hit rate declined at heart rate reserves (HRRs) of >80%, reaching nadir at 100% HRR (74.09 + 10.63%, P < 0.01). The tissue saturation index (TSI) followed a similar pattern, declining at >70% of HRR and at a greater rate during EFET compared with during GxT (P < 0.01), reaching a nadir in both conditions at 100% HRR (60.39 +2.94 vs. 63.13 + 3.16%, P < 0.01). Therefore, EF decline is dependent on exercise intensity, as is %TSI. These data suggest that reductions in EF during high-intensity exercise are at least in part related to attenuated PFC oxygenation. Thus, interventions that improve PFC oxygenation may improve combined exercise and EF performance.},

abstract = {When healthy subjects stand up, it is associated with a reduction in cerebral blood velocity and oxygenation although cerebral autoregulation would be considered to prevent a decrease in cerebral perfusion. Aging is associated with a higher incidence of falls, and in the elderly falls may occur particularly during the adaptation to postural change. This study evaluated the cerebrovascular adaptation to postural change in 15 healthy younger (YNG) vs. 15 older (OLD) subjects by recordings of the near-infrared spectroscopy-determined cerebral oxygenation (cO2Hb) and the transcranial Doppler-determined mean middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCA Vmean). In OLD (59 (52-65) years) vs. YNG (29 (27-33) years), the initial postural decline in mean arterial pressure (-52±3% vs. -67±3%), cO2Hb (-3.4±2.5$\mu$moll-1 vs. -5.3±1.7$\mu$moll-1) and MCA Vmean (-16±4% vs. -29±3%) was smaller. The decline in MCA Vmean was related to the reduction in MAP. During prolonged orthostatic stress, the decline in MCA Vmeanand cO2Hb in OLD remained smaller. We conclude that with healthy aging the postural reduction in cerebral perfusion becomes less prominent. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The acute-exercise effects upon cognitive functions are varied and dependent upon exercise duration and intensity, and the type of cognitive tasks assessed. The hypofrontality hypothesis assumes that prolonged exercise, at physiologically challenging intensities, is detrimental to executive functions due to cerebral perturbations (indicated by reduced prefrontal activity). The present study aimed to test this hypothesis by measuring oxygenation in prefrontal and motor regions using near-infrared spectroscopy during two executive tasks (flanker task and 2-back task) performed while cycling for 60 min at a very low intensity and an intensity above the ventilatory threshold. Findings revealed that, compared to very low intensity, physiologically challenging exercise (i) shortened reaction time in the flanker task, (ii) impaired performance in the 2-back task, and (iii) initially increased oxygenation in prefrontal, but not motor regions, which then became stable in both regions over time. Therefore, during prolonged exercise, not only is the intensity of exercise assessed important, but also the nature of the cognitive processes involved in the task. In contrast to the hypofrontality hypothesis, no inverse pattern of oxygenation between prefrontal and motor regions was observed, and prefrontal oxygenation was maintained over time. The present results go against the hypofrontality hypothesis.},

abstract = {High-intensity exercises including tethered efforts are commonly used in training programs for athletes, active and even sedentary individuals. Despite this, the knowledge about the external and internal load during and after this effort is scarce. Our study aimed to characterize the kinetics of mechanical and physiological responses in all-out 30 seconds (AO30) tethered running and up to 18 minutes of passive recovery. Additionally, in an innovative way, we investigated the muscle oxygenation in more or less active muscles (vastus lateralis and biceps brachii, respectively) during and after high-intensity tethered running by near-infrared spectroscopy – NIRS. Twelve physically active young men were submitted to AO30 on a non-motorized treadmill to determine the running force, velocity and power. We used wearable technologies to monitor the muscle oxygenation and heart rate responses during rest, exercise and passive recovery. Blood lactate concentration and arterial oxygen saturation were also measured. In a synchronized analysis by high capture frequency of mechanical and physiological signals, we advance the understanding of AO30 tethered running. Muscle oxygenation responses showed rapid adjustments (both, during and after AO30) in a tissue-dependence manner, with very low tissue saturation index observed in biceps brachii during exercise when compared to vastus lateralis. Significant correlations between peak and mean blood lactate with biceps brachii oxygenation indicate an important participation of less active muscle during and after high-intensity AO30 tethered running.},

abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of cadence on joint specific power and cycling kinematics in the ankle joint in addition to muscle oxygenation and muscle VO2 in the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior. Thirteen cyclists cycled at a cadence of 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 and 110 rpm at a constant external work rate of 160.1 ± 21.3 W. Increasing cadence led to a decrease in ankle power in the dorsal flexion phase and to an increase in ankle joint angular velocity above 80 rpm. In addition, increasing cadence increased deoxygenation and desaturation for both the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles. Muscle VO2 increased following increased cadence but only in the tibialis anterior and only at cadences above 80 rpm, thus coinciding with the increase in ankle joint angular velocity. There was no effect of cadence in the gastrocnemius. This study demonstrates that high cadences lead to increased mVO2 in the TA muscles that cannot be explained by power in the dorsal flexion phase.},

abstract = {Neuromuscular fatigue (NMF) and exercise performance are affected by exercise intensity and sex differences. However, whether slight changes in power output (PO) below and above the maximal lactate steady-state (MLSS) impact NMF and subsequent performance (time to exhaustion, TTE) is unknown. Purpose: This study compared NMF and TTE in females and males in response to exercise performed at MLSS, 10 W below (MLSS -10 ) and above (MLSS +10 ). Methods: Twenty participants (9 females) performed three 30-min constant-PO exercise bouts followed (1 min delay) by a TTE at 80% of the peak-PO. NMF was characterized by isometric maximal voluntary contractions (IMVC) and femoral nerve electrical stimulation of knee extensors [e.g. peak torque of potentiated high-frequency (Db100) and single twitch (TwPt)] before and immediately after the constant-PO and TTE bouts. Results: IMVC declined less after MLSS -10 (-18±10%) compared to MLSS (-26±14%) and MLSS +10 (-31±11%) (all p<0.05), and the Db100 decline was greater after MLSS +10 (-24±14%) compared to the other intensities (MLSS -10 : -15±9%; MLSS: -18±11%) (all p<0.05). Females showed smaller reductions in IMVC and TwPt compared to males after constant-PO bouts (all p<0.05), this difference being not dependant on intensity. TTE was negatively impacted by increasing the PO in the constant-PO (p<0.001), with no differences in end-exercise NMF (p>0.05). Conclusion: Slight changes in PO around MLSS elicited great changes in the reduction of maximal voluntary force and impairments in contractile function. Although NMF was lower in females compared to males, the changes in PO around the MLSS impacted both sexes similarly.},

abstract = {Investigation of marine mammal dive-by-dive blood distribution and oxygenation has been limited by a lack of noninvasive technology for use in freely diving animals. Here, we developed a noninvasive near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) device to measure relative changes in blood volume and haemoglobin oxygenation continuously in the blubber and brain of voluntarily diving harbour seals. Our results show that seals routinely exhibit preparatory peripheral vasoconstriction accompanied by increased cerebral blood volume approximately 15 s before submersion. These anticipatory adjustments confirm that blood redistribution in seals is under some degree of cognitive control that precedes the mammalian dive response. Seals also routinely increase cerebral oxygenation at a consistent time during each dive, despite a lack of access to ambient air. We suggest that this frequent and reproducible reoxygenation pattern, without access to ambient air, is underpinned by previously unrecognised changes in cerebral drainage. The ability to track blood volume and oxygenation in different tissues using NIRS will facilitate a more accurate understanding of physiological plasticity in diving animals in an increasingly disturbed and exploited environment.},

abstract = {Despite having a near perfect control over a ball, professional football/soccer players often miss penalties. Psychological factors (anxiety) are often named as explanations for these misses. A commonly used terminology is 'choking under pressure'. In this study, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to study the influence of the brain on this process. An ”in the wild” study was set-up (N=22), involving both experienced and inexperienced football players. Using permutation statistical tests, it could be concluded that activating task-irrelevant areas of the brain (PFC) were related to missed penalties and anxious players. Activating task-relevant areas, like the motor cortex, was associated with not being anxious. These results are in line with the neural efficiency theory. Furthermore the results of this study do suggest, no significant results, that the left temporal cortex and the connectivity between DLPFC and the motor cortex are involved as well. Anxious experienced players showed increased left temporal cortex activity and for inexperienced the opposite was observable and a higher DLPFC-motor cortex connectivity was related to performing under pressure. At last, this study also shows that it is possible to get reliable results during an ”in the wild” fNIRS experiment, involving physical activity.},

abstract = {Purpose: To investigate whether performing resistance exercise in hypoxia augments physiological and perceptual responses, and if altering work-rate by performing repetitions to failure compared to sub-maximally increases the magnitude of these responses. Methods: Twenty male university students (minimum of 2 year resistance training experience) completed four sessions, two in hypoxia (fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO2] = 0.13), and two in normoxia (FiO2 = 0.21). For each condition, session one comprised three sets to failure of shoulder press and bench press (high work-rate session), while session two involved the same volume load, distributed over six sets (low work-rate session). Muscle oxygenation (triceps brachii), surface electromyographic activity (anterior deltoid, pectoralis major, and triceps brachii), heart rate (HR), and arterial blood oxygen saturation were recorded. Blood lactate concentration ([Bla−]) was recorded pre-exercise and 2 min after each exercise. Muscle thickness was measured pre- and post-exercise via ultrasound. Results: Muscle oxygenation values during sets and inter-set rest periods were lower in hypoxia vs normoxia (p = 0.001). Hypoxia caused greater [Bla−] during the shoulder press of failure sessions (p = 0.003) and both shoulder press (p = 0.048) and bench press (p = 0.005) of non-failure sessions. Hypoxia increased HR during non-failure sessions (p < 0.001). There was no effect of hypoxia on muscular swelling, surface electromyographic activity, perceived exertion, or number of repetitions performed. Conclusions: Hypoxia augmented metabolite accumulation, but had no impact on any other physiological or perceptual response compared to the equivalent exercise in normoxia. Furthermore, the magnitude to which hypoxia increased the measured physiological responses was not influenced by sessional work-rate.},

Outcome measures include, mean power (W) and change in Tissue Saturation Index ($\Delta$TSI%). Repeated measures ANOVA were used to examine difference between conditions in mean power output.

There was a significant positive correlation between power output and reoxygenation rate during O2Supp (r = 0.65, p =.04). No correlation was seen between power output and reoxygenation rate during normoxia (r =-0.30, p =.40).

First published March 7, 2019; doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.00166.2018.—Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a powerful noninvasive tool with which to study the matching of oxygen delivery to oxygen utilization and the number of new publications utilizing this technique has increased exponentially in the last 20 yr. By measuring the state of oxygenation of the primary heme compounds in skeletal muscle (hemoglobin and myoglobin), greater understanding of the underlying control mechanisms that couple perfusive and diffusive oxygen delivery to oxidative metabolism can be gained from the laboratory to the athletic field to the intensive care unit or emergency room. However, the field of NIRS has been complicated by the diversity of instrumentation, the inherent limitations of some of these technologies, the associated diversity of terminology, and a general lack of standardization of protocols. This Cores of Reproducibility in Physiology (CORP) will describe in basic but important detail the most common methodologies of NIRS, their strengths and limitations, and discuss some of the potential confounding factors that can affect the quality and reproducibility of NIRS data. Recommendations are provided to reduce the variability and errors in data collection, analysis, and interpretation. The goal of this CORP is to provide readers with a greater understanding of the methodology, limitations, and best practices so as to improve the reproducibility of NIRS research in skeletal muscle.},

abstract = {Abstract Rationale: Evidence suggests interactive effects of the tea components caffeine and L-theanine on behaviour, yet no data exists exploring the impact of the two on cerebral blood flow (CBF). Objectives: The current placebo-controlled, double-blind, counterbalanced, crossover study examined the effects of caffeine and L-theanine on CBF and extended previous cognitive and mood findings by using lower doses than previous studies of a similar methodology, which more closely reflect the ratios present in tea. Methods: Twelve habitual consumers and 12 non-habitual consumers of caffeine each received 75 mg caffeine, 50 mg L-theanine, 75 mg caffeine plus 50 mg L-theanine, and placebo in a counterbalanced order across four separate visits. CBF was measured via near-infrared spectroscopy with cognition and mood assessed at baseline and 30 min post-dose. Salivary caffeine and peripheral haemodynamics were co-monitored. Results: Caffeine reduced oxygenated haemoglobin (oxy-Hb), increased deoxygenated haemoglobin (deoxy-Hb), improved performance on attention tasks and increased overall mood ratings. Increases in deoxy-Hb following caffeine were more pronounced in non-consumers. Some evidence for increased deoxy-Hb remained when caffeine was combined with L-theanine, but this effect was attenuated and the effects of caffeine on oxy-Hb, cognition and mood were eradicated. Conclusions: Combining L-theanine with caffeine, at levels and ratios equivalent to one to two cups of tea, eliminated the vasoconstrictive effect and behavioural effects of caffeine. This supports previous findings of an interaction between these substances, despite a lack of effects of L-theanine in isolation. However, at the levels tested here, this did not lead to a positive impact on behaviour.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess and compare the systemic response of oxygen uptake kinetics and muscle deoxygenation between a 30-min rest protocol and a multivisit protocol on the parameters of the power-duration relationship (i.e., critical power [CP] and W'). METHODS: Nine endurance-trained triathletes reported to the laboratory on five occasions: a preliminary graded exercise test and a familiarization, a 30-min single-visit protocol (time trials of 10, 5, and 2 min in that order interspersed with 30 min rest), and a multivisit protocol (time trials of 10, 5, and 2 min in randomized order interspersed by >24 h rest). Heart rate (HR) was recorded continuously, respiratory gases were measured breath by breath, and deoxygenation was recorded at 10 Hz using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during all tests. Blood lactate (BLa-) concentration was measured before all time trials. Maximal HR (HRmax), oxygen uptake (V˙O2) during the first 2 min (V˙O2onset), mean response time, end-exercise V˙O2 (V˙O2peak), V˙O2 amplitude (amplV˙O2), O2 deficit, NIRS $\tau$, amplitude (amplNIRS), and time delay were assessed. To compare the two protocols and to assess the differences in W' and CP, a paired sample t-test was used as well as a two-way ANOVA to assess the differences between trials and/or protocols, including trial-protocol interactions. RESULTS: No significant differences, and trivial effect sizes, were found for W' and CP between protocols (P = 0.106-0.114, d < 0.01-0.08). Furthermore, no significant differences between protocols were found for all parameters, except for [BLa-]. Significant differences between trials were found for V˙O2ampl, V˙O2onset, NIRS $\tau$, amplNIRS, [BLa-], and HRmax. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that W' and CP can be determined using the 30-min rest protocol without confounding effects of previous severe exercise compared with the multivisit protocol.},

abstract = {We sought to describe cerebrovascular responses to incremental exercise and test the hypothesis that changes in cerebral oxygenation influence maximal performance. Eleven men cycled in three conditions: 1) sea level (SL); 2) acute hypoxia [AH; hypobaric chamber, inspired PO2 (PIO2) 86 Torr]; and 3) chronic hypoxia [CH; 4,300 m, PIO2 86 Torr]. At maximal work rate (Ẇmax), fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) was surreptitiously increased to 0.60, while subjects were encouraged to continue pedaling. Changes in cerebral (frontal lobe) (COX) and muscle (vastus lateralis) oxygenation (MOX) (near infrared spectroscopy), middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (MCA Vmean; transcranial Doppler), and end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2) were analyzed across %Ẇmax (significance at P < 0.05). At SL, PETCO2, MCA Vmean, and COX fell as work rate rose from 75 to 100% Ẇmax. During AH, PETCO2 and MCA V mean declined from 50 to 100% Ẇmax, while C OX fell from rest. With CH, PETCO2 and COX dropped throughout exercise, while MCA Vmean fell only from 75 to 100% Ẇmax. MOX fell from rest to 75% W? max at SL and AH and throughout exercise in CH. The magnitude of fall in COX, but not MOX, was different between conditions (CH > AH > SL). FIO2 0.60 at Ẇmax did not prolong exercise at SL, yet allowed subjects to continue for 96 ± 61 s in AH and 162 ± 90 s in CH. During FIO2 0.60, COX rose and MOX remained constant as work rate increased. Thus cerebral hypoxia appeared to impose a limit to maximal exercise during hypobaric hypoxia (PIO2 86 Torr), since its reversal was associated with improved performance.},

abstract = {To test the hypothesis that a system's metabolic rate and the complexity of fluctuations in the output of that system are related, thirteen healthy participants performed intermittent isometric knee extensor contractions at intensities where a rise in metabolic rate would (40% maximal voluntary contraction, MVC) and would not (20% MVC) be expected. The contractions had a 60% duty factor (6 sec contraction, 4 sec rest) and were performed until task failure or for 30 min, whichever occurred sooner. Torque and surface EMG signals were sampled continuously. Complexity and fractal scaling of torque were quantified using approximate entropy (ApEn) and the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) $\alpha$ scaling exponent. Muscle metabolic rate was determined using near-infrared spectroscopy. At 40% MVC, task failure occurred after (mean ± SD) 11.5 ± 5.2 min, whereas all participants completed 30 min of contractions at 20% MVC. Muscle metabolic rate increased significantly after 2 min at 40% MVC (2.70 ± 1.48 to 4.04 ± 1.23 %{\textperiodcentered}s-1, P < 0.001), but not at 20% MVC. Similarly, complexity decreased significantly at 40% MVC (ApEn, 0.53 ± 0.19 to 0.15 ± 0.09; DFA $\alpha$, 1.37 ± 0.08 to 1.60 ± 0.09; both P < 0.001), but not at 20% MVC. The rates of change of torque complexity and muscle metabolic rate at 40% MVC were significantly correlated (ApEn, $\rho$ = −0.63, P = 0.022; DFA, $\rho$ = 0.58, P = 0.037). This study demonstrated that an inverse relationship exists between muscle torque complexity and metabolic rate during high-intensity contractions.},

abstract = {This study quantified the inter- and intra-test reliability of telemetric surface electromyography (EMG) and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during resistance exercise. Twelve well-trained young men performed high-intensity back squat exercise (12 sets at 70-90% 1-repetition maximum) on two occasions, during which EMG and NIRS continuously monitored muscle activation and oxygenation of the thigh muscles. Intra-test reliability for EMG and NIRS variables was generally higher than inter-test reliability. EMG median frequency variables were generally more reliable than amplitude-based variables. The reliability of EMG measures was not related to the intensity or number of repetitions performed during the set. No notable differences were evident in the reliability of EMG between different agonist muscles. NIRS-derived measures of oxyhaemoglobin, deoxyhaemoglobin and tissue saturation index were generally more reliable during single-repetition sets than multiple-repetition sets at the same intensity. Tissue saturation index was the most reliable NIRS variable. Although the reliability of the EMG and NIRS measures varied across the exercise protocol, the precise causes of this variability are not yet understood. However, it is likely that biological variation during multi-joint isotonic resistance exercise may account for some of the variation in the observed results. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Monitoring the affective states of a person can be highly relevant for numerous disciplines, including adaptive user interfaces, entertainment, ergonomics, medicine and therapy. In many situations, the affective state of a user is not easily observable from outside by audio or video, but may be identified by a brain-computer interface (BCI). Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a brain imaging modality gaining rising attention in the BCI community. However, fNIRS emotion recognition studies have only analyzed stimulus-locked effects. For realistic human-machine interaction scenarios, the point of time of an emotion-triggering event and the time span of an affective state are unknown. In this paper, we investigate a BCI that monitors the affective states of the user continuously over time (i.e. asynchronous BCI). In our study, fNRIS signals from eight subjects have been recorded at eight prefrontal locations in response to three different classes of affect induction by emotional audio-visual stimuli plus a neutral class. Our system evaluates short windows of 5 s length to continuously recognize affective states. We analyze hemodynamic responses, present a careful evaluation of binary classification tasks, compare time-domain and wavelet-based signal features, and investigate classification accuracies over time.},

abstract = {As a relatively new physiological signal of brain, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is being used more and more in brain–computer interface field, especially in the task of motor imagery. However, the classification accuracy based on this signal is relatively low. To improve the accuracy of classification, this paper proposes a new experimental paradigm and only uses fNIRS signals to complete the classification task of six subjects. Notably, the experiment is carried out in a non-laboratory environment, and movements of motion imagination are properly designed. And when the subjects are imagining the motions, they are also subvocalizing the movements to prevent distraction. Therefore, according to the motor area theory of the cerebral cortex, the positions of the fNIRS probes have been slightly adjusted compared with other methods. Next, the signals are classified by nine classification methods, and the different features and classification methods are compared. The results show that under this new experimental paradigm, the classification accuracy of 89.12% and 88.47% can be achieved using the support vector machine method and the random forest method, respectively, which shows that the paradigm is effective. Finally, by selecting five channels with the largest variance after empirical mode decomposition of the original signal, similar classification results can be achieved.},

The purpose of the present study is to identify reproducible methods for measuring reactive hyperemia using HbO2 NIRS signals in the calf and foot. Healthy participants (10 male, 10 female) aged 19 to 28 years performed one of two tests: reproducibility trials or elevation protocol (30 and 60 cm limb elevation above the heart). The time to 50% reperfusion (T1/2) and the second (R2q) quartile rates of reperfusion were found to be the most reproducible parameters (coefficient of variation= 7.12 to 14.1%). The time to 95% reperfusion (T95) was 12.7% more reproducible on average than the previously reported parameter of time to peak hyperemia. Measures of reperfusion time and rate slowed with increasing limb elevation. Correlations were identified between the calf and foot in the measurements of R2q (R2 = 0.713, p = 0.021), T1/2 (R2 = 0.673, p = 0.033), and T95 (R2 = 0.792, p = 0.006). Half and 95% recovery times and second and third quartile rates expressed good reproducibility and sensitivity to change with reduced perfusion pressure. NIRS measures of reactive hyperemia have the potential to evaluate microvascular perfusion in clinical populations.},

abstract = {Purpose: The present study aimed to determine whether whole-body fat oxidation and muscle deoxygenation kinetics parameters during exercise were related in individuals with different aerobic fitness levels. Methods: Eleven cyclists [peak oxygen uptake ((Formula presented.)): 64.9 ± 3.9 mL⋅kg–1⋅min–1] and 11 active individuals ((Formula presented.) : 49.1 ± 7.4 mL⋅kg–1⋅min–1) performed a maximal incremental cycling test to determine (Formula presented.) and a submaximal incremental cycling test to assess whole-body fat oxidation using indirect calorimetry and muscle deoxygenation kinetics of the vastus lateralis (VL) using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). A sinusoidal (SIN) model was used to characterize fat oxidation kinetics and to determine the intensity (Fatmax) eliciting maximal fat oxidation (MFO). The muscle deoxygenation response was fitted with a double linear model. The slope of the first parts of the kinetics (a1) and the breakpoint ([HHb]BP) were determined. Results: MFO (p = 0.01) and absolute fat oxidation rates between 20 and 65% (Formula presented.) were higher in cyclists than in active participants (p < 0.05), while Fatmax occurred at a higher absolute exercise intensity (p = 0.01). a1 was lower in cyclists (p = 0.02) and [HHb]BP occurred at a higher absolute intensity (p < 0.001) than in active individuals. (Formula presented.) was strongly correlated with MFO, Fatmax, and [HHb]BP (r = 0.65–0.88, p ≤ 0.001). MFO and Fatmax were both correlated with [HHb]BP (r = 0.66, p = 0.01 and r = 0.68, p < 0.001, respectively) and tended to be negatively correlated with a1 (r = -0.41, p = 0.06 for both). Conclusion: This study showed that whole-body fat oxidation and muscle deoxygenation kinetics were both related to aerobic fitness and that a relationship between the two kinetics exists. Individuals with greater aerobic fitness may have a delayed reliance on glycolytic metabolism at higher exercise intensities because of a longer maintained balance between O2 delivery and consumption supporting higher fat oxidation rates.},

Muscle oxygenation of the vastus lateralis and intercostal muscles was examined with near-infrared spectroscopy.

There were no clear differences in respiratory muscle deoxyhaemoglobin (−0.1%, 90% CL −2.9 to 0.9%) or oxyhaemoglobin (0.9%, 90% CL −0.8 to 2.6%) between conditions. Maintenance of respiratory muscle oxygenation may contribute to the rise of vastus lateralis deoxyhaemoglobin in hypoxia during intermittent sprint cycling.

Automaticity was evaluated by performing a visual-letter-counting task concurrently with the sequential finger movements. Our data were unable to replicate the pre-to-post-practice decrease in cortical activity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for both motor sequence tasks. The findings did reveal increased contribution from the right hemisphere following learning.

abstract = {The microvasculature is important for both health and exercise tolerance in a range of populations. However, methodological limitations have meant changes in micro- vascular blood flow are rarely assessed in humans during interventions designed to affect skeletal muscle blood flow such as the wearing of compression garments. The aim of this study is, for the first time, to use contrast- enhanced ultrasound to directly measure the effects of compression on muscle microvascular blood flow alongside measures of femoral artery blood flow and muscle oxygenation following intense exercise in healthy adults. It was hypothesized that both muscle microvascular and femoral artery blood flows would be augmented with compression garments as com- pared with a control condition. Ten recreationally active participants completed two repeated- sprint exercise sessions, with and without lower- limb compression tights. Muscle microvascular blood flow, femoral arterial blood flow (2D and Doppler ul- trasound), muscle oxygenation (near- infrared spectroscopy), cycling performance, and venous blood samples were measured/taken throughout exercise and the 1- hour post- exercise recovery period. Compared with control, compression reduced mus- cle microvascular blood volume and attenuated the exercise- induced increase in mi- crovascular velocity and flow immediately after exercise and 1 hour post- exercise. Compression increased femoral artery diameter and augmented the exercise- induced increase in femoral arterial blood flow during exercise. Markers of blood oxygen extraction in muscle were increased with compression during and after exercise. Compression had no effect on blood lactate, glucose, or exercise performance. We provide new evidence that lower- limb compression attenuates the exercise- induced increase in skeletal muscle microvascular blood flow following exercise, despite a divergent increase in femoral artery blood flow. Decreased muscle microvascular perfusion is offset by increased muscle oxygen extraction, a potential mechanism al- lowing for the maintenance of exercise performance.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 SPIE Background: A requisite for fNIRS studies of cortical blood flow is that sufficient photons are transmitted transcutaneously for the fluctuations in cerebral hemoglobin oxygenation that occur during neuronal activation to be detected. Transmission is determined by the specifications of the fNIRS device, but also influenced by the characteristics of the skin. Epidermal pigments can attenuate photon transmission; the literature states that in dark skinned subjects some NIRS devices may not achieve sufficient photon migration to monitor cortical blood flow. Hence, as fNIRS use is spreading, we describe a simple head tilt maneuver where positional redistribution of cerebral blood volume will confirm if photon transmission is sufficient. Methods: A repetitive head tilt maneuver (bending forward from a seated position, hold for 30 seconds, returning to original position X 5) performed by a pigmented (African) subject and a non-pigmented (Caucasian) subject. A 23- channel portable fNIRS system with dual wavelength (750 and 860 nm) emitters and photodiode detectors was worn over the anterior cortex, and changes in oxy, deoxy and total hemoglobin concentration measured at 50 Hz. Results: Data from both subjects were compared and found to have a comparable pattern of change in oxyhemoglobin concentration and temporal response to the effects of head tilt; clear arterial pulsations and minimal noise were also evident. Conclusion: We suggest the head tilt maneuver described as a feasible test to confirm the adequacy of transcutaneous photon transmission where fNIRS studies are to be performed in subjects with pigmented skin to detect hemodynamic change in the cortex.},

abstract = {Objective. In the last few years, the interest in applying virtual reality systems for neurorehabilitation is increasing. Their compatibility with neuroimaging techniques, such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), allows for the investigation of brain reorganization with multimodal stimulation and real-time control of the changes occurring in brain activity. The present study was aimed at testing a novel semi-immersive visuo-motor task (VMT), which has the features of being adopted in the field of neurorehabilitation of the upper limb motor function. Approach. A virtual environment was simulated through a three-dimensional hand-sensing device (the LEAP Motion Controller), and the concomitant VMT-related prefrontal cortex (PFC) response was monitored non-invasively by fNIRS. Upon the VMT, performed at three different levels of difficulty, it was hypothesized that the PFC would be activated with an expected greater level of activation in the ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC), given its involvement in the motor action planning and in the allocation of the attentional resources to generate goals from current contexts. Twenty-one subjects were asked to move their right hand/forearm with the purpose of guiding a virtual sphere over a virtual path. A twenty-channel fNIRS system was employed for measuring changes in PFC oxygenated-deoxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb/HHb, respectively). Main results. A VLPFC O2Hb increase and a concomitant HHb decrease were observed during the VMT performance, without any difference in relation to the task difficulty. Significance. The present study has revealed a particular involvement of the VLPFC in the execution of the novel proposed semi-immersive VMT adoptable in the neurorehabilitation field.},

abstract = {Occasionally firefighters need to perform very heavy bouts of work, such as smoke diving or clearing an accident site, which induce significant muscle fatigue. The time span for muscular recovery from such heavy work is not known. The purpose of this study was to evaluate firefighters' force-, neural-, metabolic-, and structural-related recovery after task-specific heavy work in the heat. Fifteen healthy firefighters (14 males and 1 female) performed a 20-min heavy work bout that simulated smoke diving and the clearance of an accident site at 35 °C. After the work, muscular recovery was evaluated by wrist flexion maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), average electromyography during MVC and during 10%MVC, rate of force production, motor response and stretch reflex responses, muscle oxygen consumption and oxygenation level, and wrist flexor muscle pennation angle. Recovery was followed for 4 h. Each of the 12 measured parameters changed significantly (p < 0.05) from those at baseline during the follow-up. Muscle oxygen consumption and the wrist flexor pennation angle remained elevated throughout the follow-up (oxygen consumption baseline, 12.9 ± 1.7 mL O2{\textperiodcentered}min-1{\textperiodcentered}(100 g)-1; 4-h value, 17.5 ± 1.6 mL O2{\textperiodcentered}min<sup>-</sup>1{\textperiodcentered}(100 g)<sup>-1</sup>; p < 0.05 and pennation angle baseline, 15.7 ± 0.8°; 4-h value, 17.8 ± 0.8°; p < 0.05).

abstract = {Surgical ACL reconstruction performed with a tourniquet induces compression and ischemic stress of the quadriceps femoris (QF) muscle which can accelerate postoperative weakness. Given that low-load blood flow restricted (BFR) exercise is potent in enhancing muscle oxygenation and vascular function, we hypothesized that short-term preconditioning with low-load BFR exercise can attenuate QF muscle endurance deterioration in the postoperative period. Twenty subjects undergoing arthroscopic ACL reconstruction performed 5 exercise sessions in the last 8 days prior to surgery. They were assigned into either BFR group, performing low-load BFR knee-extension exercise, or SHAM-BFR group, replicating equal training volume with sham occlusion. Blood flow (near-infrared spectroscopy) and surface EMG of QF muscle during sustained isometric contraction at 30% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) torque performed to volitional failure were measured prior to the intervention and again 4 and 12 weeks after surgery. There was an overall decrease (p = 0.033) in MVIC torque over time, however, no significant time-group interaction was found. The time of sustained QF contraction shortened (p = 0.002) in SHAM-BFR group by 97 ± 85 s at week 4 and returned to preoperative values at week 12. No change in the time of sustained contraction was detected in BFR group at any time point after surgery. RMS EMG amplitude increased (p = 0.009) by 54 ± 58% at week 4 after surgery in BFR group only. BFm increased (p = 0.004) by 52 ± 47% in BFR group, and decreased (p = 0.023) by 32 ± 19% in SHAM-BFR group at week 4 after surgery. Multivariate regression models of postoperative changes in time of sustained QF contraction revealed its high correlation (R2 = 0.838; p < 0.001) with changes in BFm and RMS EMG in the SHAM-BFR group, whereas no such association was found in the BFR group. In conclusion, enhanced endurance of QF muscle was triggered by combination of augmented muscle fiber recruitment and enhanced muscle perfusion. The latter alludes to a preserving effect of preconditioning with BFR exercise on density and function of QF muscle microcirculation within the first 4 weeks after ACL reconstruction.},

abstract = {Background Fewer than half of individuals with peripheral artery disease (PAD) experience classic claudication, and the relationships between PAD typical or atypical symptom intensity, location, and description (classic or atypical) with ischemic changes have not previously been reported. Objective The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between self-reported PAD symptom intensity and calf tissue ischemia measured using the tissue saturation index (TSI) during treadmill exercise. The location and descriptors of atypical PAD symptoms in the presence of calf tissue ischemia were also identified. Methods Adults with PAD with exercise-limiting ischemic symptoms were asked to (a) rate symptom intensity using a numerical rating scale (NRS) from 0 to 5 (0 = no pain, 1 = onset of pain, 5 = maximal pain), (b) provide symptom locations and descriptors, and (c) wear a near-infrared spectroscopy device to obtain calf TSI values during treadmill exercise. Multilevel models with TSI as the outcome variable were estimated during exercise and recovery. Covariates included were exercise time, recovery time, baseline TSI, exercise rating, recovery rating, ankle-brachial index (ABI), age, race, gender, body mass index, diabetes, neuropathy, and smoking. Results During three successive bouts of treadmill exercise for 40 participants (80% Caucasian men; average age = 68 years, SD = 9.2), the most rapid decline in TSI occurred between the start of exercise and symptom onset (when NRS = 1). The TSI nadir was often reached prior to report of maximum discomfort (when NRS = 5), and changes in TSI were related to exercise time (p <.001), baseline TSI (p <.001), exercise ratings (p <.001), and ABI (p <.05). During recovery, TSI increased steadily for most participants as pain eased. In the recovery model, changes in TSI were associated with recovery ratings (p <.001) and ABI (p <.03). Of 120 treadmill exercise tests, 69.2% were stopped due to discomfort in the calf with classic descriptors reported only half the time (55.4%). Discussion Exploratory analyses revealed ischemic symptoms extended beyond classic claudication locations and descriptors. Future research should evaluate changes in TSI relative to atypical locations and descriptors to improve understanding of the full range of ischemic symptoms experienced by individuals with PAD.},

The type of exercise performed may influence PFC activation, and further impact cognitive function. The present study aimed to compare PFC activation during cognitive testing after moderate-intensity, high intensity, and yoga exercises, and to determine if PFC activation is linked to cognitive performance. Eight subjects (four male and four female), aged 35 ± 5 completed a control, high intensity, moderate intensity, and yoga exercises followed by administration of a cognitive task (NIH Toolbox Fluid Cognition). Left and right PFC activation (LPFC and RPFC, respectively) were evaluated by measuring hemoglobin difference (Hbdiff) changes during post-exercise cognitive assessment using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Activation during the cognitive test was higher in the LPFC after moderate intensity exercise compared to control, high intensity, and yoga (5.30 ± 6.65 vs. 2.26 ± 2.40, 2.50 ± 1.48, 2.41 ± 2.36 µM, p < 0.05, respectively). A negative relationship was detected between LPFC and processing speed after exercise. PFC activation did not align with cognitive performance. However, acute exercise, regardless of type, appeared to alter neural processing. Specifically, less PFC activation was required for a given neural output after exercise.},

abstract = {Background: Painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis (PBS/IC) is defined as a syndrome of urgency, frequency, and suprapubic pain in the absence of positive urine culture or obvious bladder pathology. As no specific etiology has been identified yet, no specific methodology exists for diagnosis of this condition. One potential etiology of PBS/IC is inflammation of the bladder mucosa associated with abnormal angiogenesis and ulcerative lesions. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of using transcutaneous near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) of the bladder to monitor tissue oxygenation and hemodynamics as a means of differentiating subjects diagnosed with PBS/IC from those with other bladder conditions. Methods: Twenty-four adult patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction were divided into 2 groups, PBS/IC and non-PBS/IC after standard diagnostic investigations. Detrusor oxygen saturation percentage (TSI%) was measured in all subjects while they were at rest in a supine position, using a spatially resolved (SR) NIRS instrument. Mean values of detrusor TSI% were significantly different between the two groups (74.2%±4.9 in PBS/IC vs. 63.6%±5.5 in non-PBS/IC, P<0.0005). Results: Noninvasive NIRS interrogation of the bladder demonstrated that patients diagnosed as having PBS/IC had significantly higher detrusor oxygen saturation at rest. Conclusions: SR-NIRS as a feasible non-noninvasive entity for use in the evaluation of patients for the presence or absence of physiologic changes associated with PBS/IC. {\textcopyright} 2013 SPIE.},

abstract = {Background: The aims of this work were (1) to compare cerebral oxygenation-perfusion (COP), central hemodynamics, and peak oxygen uptake (V˙o2peak) in heart transplant recipients (HTRs) vs age-matched healthy controls (AMHCs) during exercise and recovery and (2) to study the relationships between COP, central hemodynamics, and V˙o2peak in HTRs and AMHCs. Methods: Twenty-six HTRs (3 women) and 27 AMHCs (5 women) were recruited. Maximal cardiopulmonary function (gas exchange analysis), cardiac hemodynamics (impedance cardiography), and left frontal COP (near-infrared spectroscopy) were measured continuously during and after a maximal ergocycle (Ergoline 800S, Bitz, Germany) test. Results: Compared with AMHCs, HTRs had lower V˙o2peak, maximal cardiac index (CImax), and maximal ventilatory variables (P < 0.05). COP was lower during exercise (oxyhemoglobin [$\delta$O2Hb], 50% and 75% of V˙O2peak, total hemoglobin [$\delta$tHb], 100% of V˙O2peak; P < 0.05), and recovery in HTRs ($\delta$O2Hb, minutes 2-5; $\delta$tHb, minutes 1-5; P < 0.05) compared with AMHCs. End-tidal pressure of CO2 was lower during exercise compared with that in AMHCs (P < 0.0001). In HTRs, CImax was positively correlated with exercise cerebral hemodynamics (R = 0.54-0.60; P < 0.01). Conclusions: In HTRs, COP was reduced during exercise and recovery compared with that in AMHCs, potentially because of a combination of blunted cerebral vasodilation by CO2, cerebrovascular dysfunction, reduced cardiac function, and medication. The impaired V˙O2peak observed in HTRs was mainly caused by reduced maximal ventilation and CI. In HTRs, COP is impaired and is correlated with cardiac function, potentially impacting cognitive function. Therefore, we need to study which interventions (eg, exercise training) are most effective for improving or normalizing (or both) COP during and after exercise in HTRs.},

abstract = {Aerobic exercise enhances the ability to sustain attention (peaking at moderate intensities) by stimulating noradrenergic activity, which affects the fronto-parietal attention network. Prior exercise studies examining attention have focused on the influence of exercise intensity, yet few studies have examined the influence of the type of exercise protocol administered. Here, we propose that sustained attention is greater during (a) moderate compared to low intensity exercise, and (b) moderate intensity exercise administered at a varied-load compared to a constant-load but the same overall intensity. To test this hypothesis, we recorded attentional focus in twelve male cyclists during a sustained attention to response task (SART) in four conditions; at rest, and during exercise at a low constant-, moderate constant- and moderate varied-load intensity. The change in $\alpha$-amylase (indicative of the noradrenergic response) from saliva samples and activation of the right prefrontal and parietal cortices using near-infrared spectroscopy were recorded. The findings revealed that moderate intensity exercise at a constant-load leads to faster responses and less accuracy in the SART than rest and low intensity exercise. Moderate intensity exercise at a variable-load leads to even faster responses but with no loss of accuracy in the SART. This pattern of results is explained by a larger increase in salivary $\alpha$-amylase during moderate (constant and varied) intensity cycling and higher activation in the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex during the varied, but not the constant-load condition. In conclusion, we show that, in addition to exercise intensity, the type of exercise also has important implications upon attentional focus. While moderate intensity exercise generally enhances attentional focus, monotonous exercise at a constant-load may mask such benefits.},

abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of active preconditioning techniques using blood flow restriction or/and systemic hypoxic exposure on repeated sprint cycling performance and oxygenation responses. Methods: Participants were 17 men; 8 were cycle trained (T: 21 ± 6 h/week) and 9 were untrained but physically active (UT). Each participant completed 4 cycles of 5 min stages of cycling at 1.5 W⋅kg–1 in four conditions [Control; IPC (ischemic preconditioning) with partial blood flow restriction (60% of relative total occlusion pressure); HPC (hypoxic preconditioning) in normobaric systemic hypoxia (FIO2 13.6%); and HIPC (hypoxic and ischemic preconditioning combined)]. Following a 40 min rest period, a repeated sprint exercise (RSE: 8 × 10 s sprints; 20 s of recovery) was performed. Near-infrared spectroscopy parameters [for each sprint, change in deoxyhemoglobin ($\Delta$[HHb]), total hemoglobin ($\Delta$[tHb]), and tissue saturation index ($\Delta$TSI%)] were measured. Results: Trained participants achieved higher power outputs (+10–16%) than UT in all conditions, yet RSE performance did not differ between active preconditioning techniques in the two groups. All conditions induced similar sprint decrement scores during RSE in both T and UT (16 ± 2 vs. 23 ± 9% in CON; 17 ± 3 vs. 19 ± 6% in IPC; 18 ± 5 vs. 20 ± 10% in HPC; and 17 ± 3 vs. 21 ± 5% in HIPC, for T and UT, respectively). During the sprints, $\Delta$[HHb] was larger after IPC than both HPC and CON in T (p < 0.001). The $\Delta$[tHb] was greater after HPC than all other conditions in T, whereas IPC, HPC, and HIPC induced higher $\Delta$[tHb] than CON in UT. Conclusion: None of the active preconditioning methods had an ergogenic effect on repeated sprint cycling performance, despite some specific hemodynamic responses (e.g., greater oxygen extraction and changes in blood volume), which were emphasized in the trained cyclists.},

abstract = {Our objective was to determine the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIT) on fitness in Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps cadets. Twenty-six college-aged (20.5 ± 1.7 years) participants completed 4 weeks of exercise training 3 days∙wk−1 consisting of either approximately 60 minutes of typical physical training or HIT wholebody calisthenics involving 4 to 7 sets of 30-second “all out” burpees separated by 4 minutes of active recovery. Several pre- and postintervention fitness variables were compared. We observed no changes across time or differences between groups in aerobic capacity, anaerobic capacity, or Army Physical Fitness Test performance (p > 0.05). However, there was a significant Group × Time interaction (p = 0.015) for skeletal muscle mitochondrial function (Tc: time constant of recovery). For the typical physical training group, we observed improved mitochondrial function (Tc decreased 2.4 ± 4.6 seconds; Cohen's d = −0.51); whereas, mitochondrial function decreased in HIT (Tc increased 2.4 ± 4.6 seconds; d = 0.50). HIT sustained fitness despite the short duration and reduced volume of activity. A program that includes HIT as part of a larger program may be well suited for maintaining fitness in moderately trained armed forces personnel without access to equipment.},

abstract = {Introduction: Retrograde shear causes endothelial damage and is pro-atherogenic. The purpose of our study was to examine the impact of vascular remodeling from habitual exercise training on acute changes in retrograde shear and microvascular oxygenation (SMO2) induced via 30 min of external compression. Methods: Participants included 11 exercise trained (ET) men (Division I track athletes; age 20 ± 3 years) and 18 recreationally active (RA) men (age 23 ± 5 years). Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to measure vastus medialis SMO2. Doppler-ultrasound was used to assess SFA intima-media thickness, diameter and flow velocity to derive retrograde shear. Vascular measures were made at baseline (BASELINE), during a sham condition (calf compression to 5 mmHg, SHAM) and during the experimental condition (calf compression to 60 mmHg, EXP). Results: Compared to RA, ET had larger SFA diameters (0.66 ± 0.06 vs 0.58 ± 0.06 cm, p < 0.05) and lower SFA IMT (0.33 ± 0.03 vs 0.36 ± 0.07 mm, p < 0.05). Retrograde shear increased similarly in both groups during EXP (p < 0.05) but ET men had lower overall retrograde shear during the conditions (BASELINE 75.8 ± 26.8 vs EXP 88.2 ± 16.9 s−1) compared to RA men (BASELINE 84.4 ± 23.3 vs EXP 106.4 ± 19.6 s−1p < 0.05). There was a similar increase in SMO2 from BASELINE to SHAM (ET + 8.1 ± 4.8 vs RA + 6.4 ± 9.7%) and BASELINE to EXP (ET + 8.7 ± 6.4 vs RA + 7.1 ± 9.0%) in both groups. Conclusion: Beneficial vascular remodeling in ET men is associated with lower retrograde shear during external compression. Acute increases in retrograde shear with external compression do not detrimentally impact microvascular oxygenation.},

abstract = {Due to its cardiovascular effects sedentary behaviour might impact cerebrovascular function in the long term, affecting cerebrovascular regulatory mechanisms and perfusion levels. Consequently this could underly potential structural brain abnormalities associated with cognitive decline. We therefore assessed the association between sedentary behaviour and brain measures of cerebrovascular perfusion and structural abnormalities in community-dwelling older adults. Using accelerometery (GENEActiv) data from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) we categorised individuals by low- and high-sedentary behaviour (≤8 vs >8 hours/day). We examined prefrontal haemoglobin oxygenation levels using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy during rest and after an orthostatic challenge in 718 individuals (66 ± 8 years, 52% female). Global grey matter cerebral blood flow, total grey and white matter volume, total and subfield hippocampal volumes, cortical thickness, and white matter hyperintensities were measured using arterial spin labelling, T1, and FLAIR MRI in 86 individuals (72 ± 6 years, 55% female). While no differences in prefrontal or global cerebral hemodynamics were found between groups, high-sedentary individuals showed lower hippocampal volumes and increased white matter hyperintensities compared to their low-sedentary counterparts. Since these structural cerebral abnormalities are associated with cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease, future work exploring the causal pathways underlying these differences is needed.},

A total of 74 near infrared spectroscopy recordings were taken from the intact skull of humans. Perfusion of the hemisphere under the detector was assessed in one of four groups: (1) healthy volunteer; (2) patient, unaffected side; (3) patient, affected side with intact collateral blood supply; (4) patient, affected side, impaired collateral blood supply. Transcranial saturation was 0.90±0.01 (all values reported as mean±S.E.) in healthy volunteers (n=24), 0.92±0.008 in the unaffected hemisphere of patients (n=23), 0.92±0.001 in the affected side if collateral supply with blood was intact (n=16). There was no statistical significance between these groups. Saturation in affected hemispheres with impaired collateral blood supply (n=9) was 0.81±0.028, which was significantly different from all other groups (P<0.05, one way-ANOVA).

abstract = {Purpose: Splenic contraction induced by repeated apneas has been shown to increase oxygen availability. Our aim was to determine whether repeated maximal voluntary apnea enhances the performance of cyclists in a subsequent 4-km time trial. Methods: Seven male cyclists [age: 27.1 ± 2.1 years; height: 182 ± 8 cm; body mass: 74.8 ± 9.2 kg; peak oxygen uptake: 56.9 ± 6.6 mL min−1 kg−1 (mean ± SD)] performed a 4-km time trial on an ergometer with and without four prior maximal bouts of apnea interspersed with 2 min of recovery. Results: The average power output during the time trial was similar with (293 ± 48 W) and without (305 ± 42 W) prior apnea (P = 0.11, d = 0.27). The spleen was reduced in size after the fourth bout of apnea (−12.4 ± 9.0 %), as well as one (−36.6 ± 10.3 %) and 10 min (−19.5 ± 17.9 %) after the time trial, while with normal breathing the spleen was smaller one (−35.0 ± 11.3 %) and 10 min (−23.4 ± 19.7 %) after the time trial. Heart rate; oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide production; tissue oxygen saturation; and the lactate concentration, pH, oxygen saturation, level of hemoglobin and hematocrit of the blood were similar under both conditions. Conclusions: Our present findings reveal that four apneas by cyclists prior to a 4-km time trial led to splenic contraction, but no change in mean power output, the level of hemoglobin, hematocrit, oxygen saturation of the m. vastus lateralis or oxygen uptake.},

abstract = {Background Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to perturb both cortical neural activity and hemodynamics during (online) and after the stimulation, however mechanisms of these tDCS-induced online and after-effects are not known. Here, online resting-state spontaneous brain activation may be relevant to monitor tDCS neuromodulatory effects that can be measured using electroencephalography (EEG) in conjunction with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Method We present a Kalman Filter based online parameter estimation of an autoregressive (ARX) model to track the transient coupling relation between the changes in EEG power spectrum and NIRS signals during anodal tDCS (2 mA, 10 min) using a 4 × 1 ring high-definition montage. Results Our online ARX parameter estimation technique using the cross-correlation between log (base-10) transformed EEG band-power (0.5–11.25 Hz) and NIRS oxy-hemoglobin signal in the low frequency (≤0.1 Hz) range was shown in 5 healthy subjects to be sensitive to detect transient EEG-NIRS coupling changes in resting-state spontaneous brain activation during anodal tDCS. Conventional sliding window cross-correlation calculations suffer a fundamental problem in computing the phase relationship as the signal in the window is considered time-invariant and the choice of the window length and step size are subjective. Here, Kalman Filter based method allowed online ARX parameter estimation using time-varying signals that could capture transients in the coupling relationship between EEG and NIRS signals. Conclusion Our new online ARX model based tracking method allows continuous assessment of the transient coupling between the electrophysiological (EEG) and the hemodynamic (NIRS) signals representing resting-state spontaneous brain activation during anodal tDCS.},

abstract = {New Findings: What is the central question of this study? Is there an association of plasma concentration of asymmetric dimethylarginine, which is related to exercise capacity in patients with cardiovascular diseases, with oxygen delivery and subsequently exercise capacity in healthy subjects in the absence of the potentially confounding influence of inflammation and oxidative stress? What is the main finding and its importance? Plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine concentrations are not related to exercise capacity in healthy subjects, while O2 delivery in the working skeletal muscle during the maximal graded-exercise test is not associated with any of the l-arginine analogues. ADMA alone does not play a crucial role in local muscle perfusion and in maintaining exercise capacity. Abstract: Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis that could limit oxygen (O2) delivery in the working skeletal muscles by altering endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. Exercise capacity is associated with plasma ADMA concentrations in patients with cardiovascular diseases, but this issue has still not been investigated in healthy subjects. We aimed to determine whether plasma ADMA concentrations were negatively associated with exercise capacity in young healthy male subjects. Ten men with maximal oxygen uptake ((Formula presented.)) > 65 mL kg−1 min−1 were included in the high exercise capacity group (HI-FIT), and 10 men with (Formula presented.) < 45 mL kg−1 min−1 were included in the low exercise capacity group (LO-FIT). Plasma ADMA and other l-arginine analogue concentrations were measured before and after a maximal graded-exercise test by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Microvascular O2 delivery during exercise was estimated through the pattern from the sigmoid model of muscle deoxygenation in the vastus lateralis measured by near infrared spectroscopy. (Formula presented.) was 60% higher in the HI-FIT group (median: 70.2 mL kg−1 min−1; IQR: 68.0–71.9 mL kg−1 min−1) than in the LO-FIT group (median: 43.8 mL kg−1 min−1; IQR: 34.8–45.3 mL kg−1 min−1). Plasma ADMA concentrations did not differ between the LO-FIT and HI-FIT groups before (0.50 ± 0.06 vs. 0.54 ± 0.07 $\mu$mol L−1, respectively) and after the maximal incremental exercise test (0.49 ± 0.08 vs. 0.55 ± 0.03 $\mu$mol L−1, respectively). There was no significant association of plasma ADMA concentrations with the pattern of local muscle deoxygenation and exercise capacity. Exercise capacity and microvascular O2 delivery are not related to plasma ADMA concentrations in young healthy male subjects. Our findings show that ADMA does not play a crucial role in local muscle perfusion and in maintaining exercise capacity without pathological conditions.},

Before and after the exposures all subjects performed a constant power test (CP) to exhaustion in hypoxia (FI O2=0.120) at a work load corresponding to 75% of previously determined normoxic V O2 peak. Arterial oxygen saturation (Sp O2) and minute ventilation (V E) were measured continuously.

Although neither group improved CP time, the SIH group exhibited increases in both V E (+15%; P< 0.05) and Sp O2 (+4%; P< 0.05) after intermittent hypoxia. No physiologically significant differences were observed during exercise in vastus lateralis, serratus anterior and cerebral oxygenation between groups and testing periods.

We evaluated the effects of skin and core tissue cooling on skeletal muscle blood volume and deoxygenation during sustained walking and running. Eleven male participants walked or ran six times on a treadmill for 60 min in ambient temperatures of 22°C (Neutral), 0°C for skin cooling (Cold 1), and at 0°C following a core and skin cooling protocol (Cold 2). Difference between oxy/deoxygenated haemoglobin ([diffHb]: deoxygenation index) and total haemoglobin content ([tHb]: total blood volume) in the vastus lateralis (VL) muscle was measured continuously. During walking, lower [tHb] was observed at 1 min in Cold 1 and Cold 2 vs. Neutral (P˂0.05). Lower [diffHb] was seen at 1 and 10 min in Cold 2 vs. Neutral by 13.5 ± 1.2 µM and 15.3 ± 1.4 µM and Cold 1 by 10.4 ± 3.1 µM and 11.1 ± 4.1 µM, respectively (P˂0.05). During running, [tHb] was lower in Cold 2 vs. Neutral at 10 min only (P = 0.004). [diffHb] was lower at 1 min in Cold 2 by 11.3 ± 3.1 µM compared to Neutral and by 13.5 ± 2.8 µM compared to Cold 1 (P˂0.001). Core tissue cooling, prior to exercise, induced greater deoxygenation of the VL muscle during the early stages of exercise, irrespective of changes in blood volume. Skin cooling alone, however, did not influence deoxygenation of the VL during exercise.},

abstract = {Background Acute hyperglycemia reduces NO bioavailability and causes macro- and microvascular dysfunction. Watermelon juice (WMJ) is a natural source of the amino acid citrulline, which is metabolized to form arginine for the NO cycle and may improve vascular function. Objectives We examined the effects of 2 weeks of WMJ compared to a calorie-matched placebo (PLA) to attenuate acute hyperglycemia-induced vascular dysfunction. Methods In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial, 6 men and 11 women (aged 21–25; BMI, 23.5 ± 3.2 kg/m2) received 2 weeks of daily WMJ (500 mL) or a PLA drink followed by an oral-glucose-tolerance test. Postprandial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was measured by ultrasound (primary outcome), while postprandial microvascular blood flow (MVBF) and ischemic reperfusion were measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) vascular occlusion test (VOT). Results The postprandial FMD area AUC was higher after WMJ supplementation compared to PLA supplementation (838 ± 459% {\textperiodcentered} 90 min compared with 539 ± 278% {\textperiodcentered} 90 min; P = 0.03). The postprandial MVBF (AUC) was higher (P = 0.01) following WMJ supplementation (51.0 ± 29.1 mL blood {\textperiodcentered} 100 mL tissue–1 {\textperiodcentered} min–1 {\textperiodcentered} 90 min) compared to the PLA (36.0 ± 20.5 mL blood {\textperiodcentered} 100 mL tissue–1 {\textperiodcentered} min–1 {\textperiodcentered} 90 min; P = 0.01). There was a significant treatment effect (P = 0.048) for WMJ supplementation (71.2 ± 1.5%) to increase baseline tissue oxygen saturation (StO2%) when compared to PLA (65.9 ± 1.7%). The ischemic-reperfusion slope was not affected by WMJ treatment (P = 0.83). Conclusions Two weeks of daily WMJ supplementation improved FMD and some aspects of microvascular function (NIRS-VOT) during experimentally induced acute hyperglycemia in healthy adults. Preserved postprandial endothelial function and enhanced skeletal muscle StO2% are likely partially mediated by increased NO production (via citrulline conversion into arginine) and by the potential antioxidant effect of other bioactive compounds in WMJ.},

Changes in haemodynamics [heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO)] and peripheral muscle oxygenation [oxyhaemoglobin ([HbO2]), deoxyhaemoglobin ([HHb]), total haemoglobin ([tHb]), tissue saturation index (TSI)] and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) were continuously recorded during simulated dynamic BH. BHDs showed a breaking point in HR kinetics at mid-BH immediately preceding a more pronounced drop in HR (−0.86 bpm.%−1) while HR kinetics in NDs steadily decreased throughout BH (−0.47 bpm.%−1). By contrast, SV remained unchanged during BH in both groups (all P > 0.05). Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) results (mean ± SD) expressed as percentage changes from the initial values showed a lower [HHb] increase for BHDs than for NDs at the cessation of BH (+24.0 ± 10.1 vs. +39.2 ± 9.6%, respectively; P < 0.05). As a result, BHDs showed a [tHb] drop that NDs did not at the end of BH (−7.3 ± 3.2 vs. −3.0 ± 4.7%, respectively; P < 0.05). The most striking finding of the present study was that BHDs presented an increase in oxygen-conserving efficiency due to substantial shifts in both cardiac and peripheral haemodynamics during simulated BH. In addition, the kinetic-based approach we used provides further credence to the concept of an “oxygen-conserving breaking point” in the human diving response.},

abstract = {Metabolic inflexibility is an emerging physiological marker indicative of metabolic dysfunction and associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. Exercise is a potent stimulus to improve metabolic health, however, not much is known about the acute effects of exercise on metabolic flexibility (METFLEX). The purpose of this dissertation was study the time-course of diet and exercise and its effects on METFLEX. Three studies were conducted to investigate molecular and clinical aspects of diet and exercise and how these stimuli may alter the metabolic response to fuel. The first study was conducted on obesity-prone, Osborne-Mendel (OM) and obesity-resistant S5B/Pl (S5B) rats. This experiment investigated inherent differences in EE, metabolic rate, METFLEX and skeletal muscle markers of metabolism, lipid storage and lipid oxidation between OM and S5B, as well as HFD-induced strain differences in these parameters. The consumption of a HFD in S5B rats increased metabolic rate and EE and decreased metabolic rate and EE in OM rats. These strain differences were not due to the differences in activity or food intake. These results suggest that HFD-induced differences in metabolic rate and EE may be mediated by HFD-induced differences in pAMPK and PPAR$\gamma$ expression and lipid accumulation in the gastrocnemius muscle of OM and S5B rats. The second study was designed to investigate the effect of acute aerobic exercise at an intensity that maximizes the rate of fat oxidation (FATMAX) on glucose tolerance, insulin action, and METFLEX compared to acute aerobic exercise at lactate threshold (OBLA) resulting in greater carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation. OBLA exercise appears to have deleterious effects on oral glucose tolerance and metabolic flexibility acutely, however, FM exercise does not confer improved METFLEX. These results suggest that predominate substrate utilization does not promote improved glucose tolerance and metabolic flexibility in young overweight men. The third and final study of this dissertation was designed to investigate the immediate and extended of a single bout of high intensity interval exercise (HIIE) on METFLEX and mitochondrial function. Participants were recruited with a family history (FmHx) of T2D (n=8) and without a family history of T2D (n=8). The extended effects (48 hours) work via the reduction fat oxidation by increasing resting fat oxidation rate and improving the suppression of fat oxidation in response to a mixed meal.},

abstract = {Wearable, wireless near-infrared (NIR) spectrometers were used to compare changes in on-ice short-track skating race simulations over 1,500 m with a 3-min cycle ergometry test at constant power output (400 W). The subjects were six male elite short-track speed skaters. Both protocols elicited a rapid desaturation (TSI%) in the muscle during early stages (initial 20 s); however, asymmetry between right and left legs was seen in $\Delta$TSI% for the skating protocol, but not for cycling. Individual differences between skaters were present in both protocols. Notably, one individual who showed a relatively small TSI% change (-10.7%, group mean =-26.1%) showed a similarly small change during the cycling protocol (-5.8%, group mean =-14.3%). We conclude that NIRS-detected leg asymmetry is due to the specific demands of short-track speed skating. However, heterogeneity between individuals is not specific to the mode of exercise. Whether this is a result of genuine differences in physiology or a reflection of differences in the optical properties of the leg remains to be determined. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {Background: The Richalet hypoxia sensitivity test (RT), which quantifies the cardiorespiratory response to acute hypoxia during exercise at an intensity corresponding to a heart rate of $\sim$130 bpm in normoxia, can predict susceptibility of altitude sickness. Its ability to predict exercise performance in hypoxia is unknown. Objectives: Investigate: (1) whether cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral tissue oxygenation (O2Hb; oxygenated hemoglobin, HHb; deoxygenated hemoglobin) responses during RT predict time-trial cycling (TT) performance in severe hypoxia; (2) if subjects with blunted cardiorespiratory responses during RT show greater impairment of TT performance in severe hypoxia. Study design: Thirteen men [27 ± 7 years (mean ± SD), Wmax: 385 ± 30 W] were evaluated with RT and the results related to two 15 km TT, in normoxia and severe hypoxia (FIO2 = 0.11). Results: During RT, mean middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv: index of CBF) was unaltered with hypoxia at rest (p > 0.05), while it was increased during normoxic (+22 ± 12 %, p < 0.05) and hypoxic exercise (+33 ± 17 %, p < 0.05). Resting hypoxia lowered cerebral O 2Hb by 2.2 ± 1.2 $\mu$mol (p < 0.05 vs. resting normoxia); hypoxic exercise further lowered it to -7.6 ± 3.1 $\mu$mol below baseline (p < 0.05). Cerebral HHb, increased by 3.5 ± 1.8 $\mu$mol in resting hypoxia (p < 0.05), and further to 8.5 ± 2.9 $\mu$mol in hypoxic exercise (p < 0.05). Changes in CBF and cerebral tissue oxygenation during RT did not correlate with TT performance loss (R = 0.4, p > 0.05 and R = 0.5, p > 0.05, respectively), while tissue oxygenation and SaO2 changes during TT did (R = -0.76, p < 0.05). Significant correlations were observed between SaO2, MCAv and HHb during RT (R = -0.77, -0.76 and 0.84 respectively, p < 0.05 in all cases). Conclusions: CBF and cerebral tissue oxygenation changes during RT do not predict performance impairment in hypoxia. Since the changes in SaO2 and brain HHb during the TT correlated with performance impairment, the hypothesis that brain oxygenation plays a limiting role for global exercise in conditions of severe hypoxia remains to be tested further. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Music can be thought of as a complex stimulus able to enrich the encoding of an event thus boosting its subsequent retrieval. However, several findings suggest that music can also interfere with memory performance. A better understanding of the behavioral and neural processes involved can substantially improve knowledge and shed new light on the most efficient music-based interventions. Based on fNIRS studies on music, episodic encoding, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), this work aims to extend previous findings by monitoring the entire lateral PFC during both encoding and retrieval of verbal material. Nineteen participants were asked to encode lists of words presented with either background music or silence and subsequently tested during a free recall task. Meanwhile, their PFC was monitored using a 48-channel fNIRS system. Behavioral results showed greater chunking of words under the music condition, suggesting the employment of associative strategies for items encoded with music. fNIRS results showed that music provided a less demanding way of modulating both episodic encoding and retrieval, with a general prefrontal decreased activity under the music versus silence condition. This suggests that music-related memory processes rely on specific neural mechanisms and that music can positively influence both episodic encoding and retrieval of verbal information.},

A total of 119 PAD patients with claudication and 30 healthy participants were enrolled. Ankle brachial index (ABI), adipose tissue thickness, and rmVO2 in the gastrocnemius after venous (rmVO2ven) or arterial (rmVO 2art) occlusion were measured with NIRS. Compared to rmVO 2art, rmVO2ven determination was less painful (P =.001), with higher values (P <.0001). rmVO2ven of PAD patients was not significantly different from healthy participants and was inversely correlated with the corresponding ABI (P =.018). rmVO2ven from severely diseased legs was higher than values from borderline/moderately diseased legs (P =.003). The determination of rmVO2ven by NIRS is suitable for the clinical setting and allows noninvasive quantification of a compensatory peripheral adaptation in patients with PAD. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Vasovagal syncope is usually described as a sudden and transient loss of consciousness that resolves spontaneously. Cardiocirculatory changes are well described during and before syncope. However, changes in the cerebral oxygenation are not well defined. In this study, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to assess the cerebral oxygenation directly during 80°head-up (HU) tilt. To simulate central hypovolaemia, 500 ml of blood was drawn from each of 10 healthy subjects. Oxygenation index (OI) was defined as the difference between oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin concentration. Blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac output were monitored using a finger plethysmographic device. The protocol was divided into two stages, each consisting of a 15-min stabilization period in the supine (SUP) position, 15 min in HU position and another 10 min in SUP position, Between both stages, blood was drawn from the subject. Haemoglobin concentration and haematocrit were measured before and 30 min after withdrawal of blood. No compensatory haemodilution was observed. During HU position in the second stage, six subjects showed signs of presyncope (F) and four did not (NF). A significant difference between F and NF was found in the observation that, before fainting, the OI of F showed a steady and significant (P = 0.02) decrease (-1.4 ± 0.5 $\mu$M min-1) compared with NF (-0.18 ± 0.16 $\mu$M min-1). This indicates that the onset of (pre)syncope is preceded by a mismatch between oxygen demand and oxygen supply in the cerebrum. Using NIRS enabled us to monitor this mismatch and to predict the onset of a syncope before clear signs in cardiocirculatory variables were visible.},

The purpose of this study was to determine the degree of muscle oxygenation associated with different cycling cadences and exercise intensities, and its putative role in the choice of self-selected cadence during cycling. We recorded cardiopulmonary and metabolic responses to cycling at exercise intensities of 70% and 90% of the ventilatory threshold (T vent ), and used near-infrared spectroscopy to determine tissue saturation index as a measure of skeletal muscle (vastus lateralis) oxygenation. Twelve participants cycled at cadences of 30, 50, 70, 90, and 110 revolutions per minute (rpm), each for 4 min, in a randomized sequence, interspersed with active recovery periods. Despite cardiopulmonary and metabolic responses being greater at 90% than at 70% T vent , and at 110 rpm compared with lower cadences, vastus lateralis oxygenation was not different between the two exercise intensities and five cadences tested. Our results indicate that skeletal muscle tissue saturation index is not substantially affected during cycling for short periods of time at constant, moderate exercise intensity at cadences between 30 and 110 rpm, suggesting that skeletal muscle oxygenation may not be an important negative feedback signal in the choice of self-selected cadence during cycling at moderate exercise intensity.},

abstract = {Objective: To explore measures of peripheral muscular oxygenation, coupled to gait characteristics, between preterm and full-term children during a 6-minute walking test (6MWT). Study design: Prepubescent children performed a 6MWT. During the test, changes in muscular oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, and total hemoglobin were measured with Near-infrared spectroscopy technology, positioned on subjects' calves. Gait variables were monitored with the OptoGait system. Results: Forty-five children (33 full-term children and 12 preterm children, mean age, 4.9 ± 0.7 and 4.6 ± 0.9 years, respectively) participated in this study. Statistical analysis highlighted a decreased walking performance for preterm children, with significantly lower walking distance (P <.05) than children born full-term (405.1 ± 91.8 m vs 461.0 ± 73.3 m respectively; −9%). A concomitant increase of oxygen extraction (over the time course of Variation of desoxyhemoglobin) was observed from the third minute of the test (P <.05). No statistically significant difference was found for other near-infrared spectroscopy measures. Finally, the analysis of gait variables highlighted a group effect for walking speed (P <.05) and stride length (P <.01). Conclusions: Premature children showed decreased walking performance and greater change in peripheral muscular oxygen extraction, associated with slower walking speed and stride length. This may point to a muscular maladjustment and reduced functional capacities for children born preterm. These phenomena could be responsible for greater muscular fatigue.},

abstract = {In the past decade, advances in the surgical management of children with severe congenital heart disease (CHD) have led to a dramatic improvement in survival. The greatest impact of these advances has been on neonates with complex, and what previously would have been lethal, heart disease. However, there are an increasing number of reports on adverse neurologic outcomes in neonates and infants after this kind of operation, ranging from mild neuropsychologic deficits, detectable only by means of sensitive tests, to gross damage, resulting in persisting vegetative state or death.1 , 2 , 3 The awareness that improved survival comes at the cost of substantial neurologic morbidity has been an incentive for extensive research in this field. Some lifesaving surgical procedures are impossible without deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA), but this procedure has been linked with neurologic sequelae. Although the duration of “safe DHCA” remains unknown, adverse outcomes are more frequently observed in children with a DHCA duration exceeding 45 minutes.4 Various strategies for preventing neurologic problems and allowing the surgeon more time for optimal repair and hemostasis have been developed. One of the most promising is low-flow antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP).5 This technique has been successfully applied in adults and is being introduced in neonatal aortic surgery.},

abstract = {New Findings: What is the central question of the study? Cuff-occlusion duration may influence contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) assessments of skeletal muscle microvascular blood flow responsiveness: what are the effects of 1, 3 and 5 min cuff-occlusion on the magnitude and reliability of calf muscle microvascular blood flow responsiveness in older adults? What is the main finding and its importance? Calf muscle microvascular blood flow responsiveness was enhanced following 5 min cuff-occlusion compared with 1 min. The reliability of post-occlusion CEUS measurements was also improved following 5 min occlusion. The use of a standardized 5 min occlusion period should therefore be considered in future studies and clinical practice. Abstract: Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is increasingly used in assessments of skeletal muscle microvascular blood flow responsiveness. In response to limb cuff-occlusion, some studies have reported significant impairments in CEUS measurements of microvascular blood flow in older adults with cardiovascular or metabolic disease, whereas others have failed to detect significant between-group differences, which has brought the reliability of the technique into question. In the absence of a standardized CEUS protocol, there is variance in the duration of cuff-occlusion used, which is likely to influence post-occlusion measurements of muscle microvascular blood flow. We aimed to determine the effect of cuff-occlusion duration by comparing the magnitude and reliability of CEUS measurements of calf muscle microvascular blood flow responsiveness in older adults (n = 15, 67 ± 11 years) following 1, 3 and 5 min occlusion periods. Microvascular blood flow (= microvascular volume × microvascular velocity) within the calf muscle was measured using real-time destruction–replenishment CEUS. Measurements were made following thigh cuff-occlusion (200 mmHg) periods of 1, 3 and 5 min in a random order. Microvascular blood flow was higher following 3 min (3.71 ± 1.46 aU s−1) and 5 min (3.47 ± 1.48 aU s−1) compared with 1 min (2.42 ± 1.27 aU s−1, P = 0.002), which corresponded with higher microvascular volumes after 3 and 5 min compared with 1 min. Reliability was good following 5 min (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.49) compared with poor following 1 min (ICC 0.34) and 3 min (ICC 0.35). This study demonstrates that the magnitude and reliability of calf muscle microvascular responsiveness is enhanced using a 5 min cuff-occlusion protocol compared with 1 min in older adults.},

abstract = {Motion is disruptive to neuroimaging methods. Motion artefacts range from large amplitude and short frequency spikes to drifts in amplitude causing cofounds in the analysis or completely invalidating any analysis, leading to epoch exclusion of data. However, we can only acquire ecologically robust information if subjects are engaging in natural interaction with their environment. Even more so in the case of sports, infants or motor disorder afflicted populations, where movement will happen. We proposed to study the relationship between channel location and Inertial Measuring Unit (IMU) quantified head movements, in order to better understand their effects in fNIRS data. Cerebral oxygenated (O2Hb) and deoxygenated (HHb) haemoglobin were measured bilaterally in prefrontal to frontal and occipital to temporo-parietal regions of healthy individuals. All participants performed controlled head movements in four conditions: Up, Down, measured by pitch IMU values; and Left, Right, measured by yaw IMU values, in varying degrees of movement. We analysed amplitude and coefficient of determination of O2Hb and HHb, within conditions and channel coordinates across subjects. Our results show that smaller angle magnitude movements (bellow 60 degrees in rotation) are significantly different than larger angle magnitude movements (above 75 degrees in rotation) with a p value of 0.0073; and that the Up condition is significantly different than other movement directions with a p value of 0.0001. We conclude that movement artefacts do not depend on area of measurement for the movement conditions studied. We recommend the application of threshold values for the future with the use of the IMU, by ignoring the effects of lower magnitudes of movement, while correcting or removing larger magnitudes. In future motion artefact removal, we recommend using an IMU for optimal head motion correction of cerebral oxygenation signals},

abstract = {Background. Since the brain is intact, persons with a spinal cord injury (SCI) might benefit from a brain-computer interface (BCI) to improve mobility by making use of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Objective. We aimed to use fNIRS to detect contralateral primary motor cortex activity during attempted foot movements in participants with complete SCI. Methods. A 6-channel fNIRS, including 2 reference channels, measured relative concentration changes of oxy- (HbO) and deoxy-hemoglobin (HbR) in the contralateral motor cortex for the right foot. Seven subjects, studied within 18 months after injury, performed 12 trials of attempted right foot and real hand movements. Results. T tests revealed significant HbO and HbR responses of the left motor cortex for attempted foot movements, but not for right hand movements. A 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed a larger decrease in HbR for attempted foot movements compared to hand movements. Individual results show major interindividual differences in (number of) channels activated and the sensitive chromophore (HbR or HbO). Conclusions. On group level, activity in the motor cortex of the foot can be measured with fNIRS in patients with complete SCI during attempted foot movements and might in principle be used in future BCI studies and applications. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

NIRS is a real-time spectroscopic method used to measure functional hemodynamic responses related to neural activation in the brain. The prefrontal hemodynamic responses of 17 young adults and 21 elderly adults were monitored while they completed the Wisconsin card sorting test (WCST). The results revealed a slower activation pattern in oxyhemoglobin concentrations in the elderly group than in the young group. Furthermore, quantified results revealed time- varying trends in hemodynamic responses.

A new near infrared spectroscope was used for determining the reproducibility of CBV measurements assessed by the O2-method. Twenty-seven healthy subjects were investigated. An intrasubject coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated, based on four identical episodes of desaturation-resaturation (O2method) procedures for CBV measurements. Two trials were performed, with (trial 1) and without (trial 2) disconnecting the equipment. A mean CV of 12.6% and 10.0% was found in trial 1 and 2, respectively. Cerebral blood volume values yield 3.60 ± 0.82 mL 100 g-1. Cerebral blood volume could be measured reproducible in adults using near infrared spectroscopy, if the arterial desaturation is limited to approximately 5% from baseline level.},

abstract = {Purpose : Although sport climbing is a self-paced whole-body activity, speed varies with climbing style, and the effect of this on systemic and localized oxygen responses is not well understood. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine muscle and pulmonary oxygen responses during submaximal climbing at differing speeds of ascent. Methods : Thirty-two intermediate and advanced sport climbers completed three 4-minute-long ascents of the same route at 4, 6, and 9 m{\textperiodcentered}min −1 on a motorized climbing ergometer (treadwall) on separate laboratory visits. Gas analysis and near-infrared spectroscopy were used to determine systemic oxygen uptake ( ) and muscle oxygen saturation (StO 2 ) of the flexor digitorum profundus. Results : Increases in ascent speed of 1 m{\textperiodcentered}min −1 led to increases of by 2.4 mL{\textperiodcentered}kg −1 {\textperiodcentered}min −1 (95% CI, 2.1 to 2.8 mL{\textperiodcentered}kg −1 {\textperiodcentered}min −1 ) and decreases in StO 2 by −1.3% (95% CI, 1.9% to −0.7%). There was a significant interaction of climbing ability and speed for StO 2 ( P < .001, ). The results revealed that the decrease of StO 2 was present for intermediate but not advanced climbers. Conclusions : In this study, the results suggest that demand during climbing was largely determined by climbing speed; however, the ability level of the climber appeared to mitigate StO 2 at a cellular level. Coaches and instructors may prescribe climbing ascents with elevated speed to improve generalized cardiorespiratory fitness. To stimulate localized aerobic capacity, however, climbers should perhaps increase the intensity of training ascents through the manipulation of wall angle or reduction of hold size.},

abstract = {Aims: The present study aims to examine: (1) the relationship between young children's bilingualism and their performance in the Dimensional Card Change Sort (DCCS) task; and (2) whether prefrontal activation was associated with children's bilingualism and executive function. Methodology: Children performed three sessions of the DCCS and their brain activity during the task was measured using functional nearinfrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Data and analysis: A sample of bilingual children (N = 49) was recruited from a preschool with an English immersion program. We examined whether children's performance in the DCCS was related to their bilingualism and whether the changes in oxygenated hemoglobin in the prefrontal regions were related to their bilingualism and performance in the DCCS. Findings/conclusions: Results showed that children's English ability was significantly correlated with their behavioral performance in DCCS, and predicted children's group membership (pass or perseverate). Furthermore, children in the pass group significantly activated the prefrontal cortex than those in the perseverate group, and activation in the prefrontal region was significantly correlated with children's English ability. Originality: The current study first examined the effect of children's bilingualism on their executive function and prefrontal activation.},

abstract = {The literature contains limited evidence on how our brains control eccentric movement. A higher activation is expected in the contralateral motor cortex (M1) but consensus has not yet been reached. Therefore, the present study aimed to compare patterns of M1 activation between eccentric and concentric movements. Nine healthy participants performed in a randomized order three sets of ﬁve repetitions of eccentric or concentric movement with the dominant elbow ﬂexors over a range of motion of 60◦ at two velocities (30◦/s and 60◦/s). The tests were carried out using a Biodex isokinetic dynamometer with the forearm supported in the horizontal plane. The peak torque values were not signiﬁcantly different between concentric and eccentric movements (p = 0.42). Hemodynamic responses of the contralateral and ipsilateral M1 were measured with a near-infrared spectroscopy system (Oxymon MkIII, Artinis). A higher contralateral M1 activity was found during eccentric movements (p = 0.04, $\eta$2 = 0.47) and at the velocity of 30◦/s (p = 0.039, $\eta$2 = 0.48). These preliminary ﬁndings indicate a speciﬁc control mechanism in the contralateral M1 to produce eccentric muscle actions at the angular velocities investigated, although the role of other brain areas in the motor control network cannot be excluded.},

Sixteen individuals with T2DM (age 55.1±5.4 years) performed four separate tests receiving LEDT or placebo in random order, at intervals of at least 14 days. A light-emitting diode array (50GaAIAs LEDs, 850nm, 75mW per diode) was used to perform LEDT bilaterally on the quadriceps femoris and triceps surae muscles for 40s at each site. After, a moderate cycling exercise was performed and oxygen uptake, muscular deoxyhemoglobin, heart rate and cardiac output were measured. Lactate and glucose levels were measured before LEDT/placebo and after the exercise. The LEDT decreased the glucose levels after the exercise compared with values before LEDT (173.7±61.0 to 143.5±53.5 mg/dl, P=0.02) and it did not affect the cardiopulmonary and hemodynamic adjustments in exercise, as well as lactate levels in both groups. In conclusion, the LEDT in combination with moderate exercise acutely decreased the glucose levels in men with T2DM.},

abstract = {The dose-response effects of the intensity of exercise upon the potential regulation (through top-down processes) of affective (pleasure-displeasure) responses in the prefrontal cortex during an incremental exercise protocol have not been explored. This study examined the functional capacity of the prefrontal cortex (reflected by haemodynamics using near infrared spectroscopy) and affective responses during exercise at different intensities. Participants completed an incremental cycling exercise test to exhaustion. Changes ($\Delta$) in oxygenation (O2Hb), deoxygenation (HHb), blood volume (tHb) and haemoglobin difference (HbDiff) were measured from bilateral dorsal and ventral prefrontal areas. Affective responses were measured every minute during exercise. Data were extracted at intensities standardised to: below ventilatory threshold, at ventilatory threshold, respiratory compensation point and the end of exercise. During exercise at intensities from ventilatory threshold to respiratory compensation point, $\Delta$O2Hb, $\Delta$HbDiff and $\Delta$tHb were greater in mostly ventral than dorsal regions. From the respiratory compensation point to the end of exercise, $\Delta$O2Hb remained stable and $\Delta$HbDiff declined in dorsal regions. As the intensity increased above the ventilatory threshold, inverse associations between affective responses and oxygenation in (a) all regions of the left hemisphere and (b) lateral (dorsal and ventral) regions followed by the midline (ventral) region in the right hemisphere were observed. Differential activation patterns occur within the prefrontal cortex and are associated with affective responses during cycling exercise. {\textcopyright} 2014 Tempest et al.},

abstract = {Hypoxic preconditioning prevents cerebrovascular/cardiovascular disorders by increasing resistance to acute ischemic stress, but severe hypoxic exposure disturbs vascular hemodynamics. This study compared how various exercise regimens with/without hypoxia affect hemodynamics and oxygenation in cardiac, muscle, and cerebral tissues during severe hypoxic exposure. Sixty sedentary males were randomly divided into five groups. Each group (n = 12) received one of five interventions: 1) normoxic (21% O2) resting control, 2) hypoxic (15% O2) resting control, 3) normoxic exercise (50% maximum work rate under 21% O2; N-E group), 4) hypoxic-relative exercise (50% maximal heart rate reserve under 15% O2; H-RE group), or 5) hypoxicabsolute exercise (50% maximum work rate under 15% O2; H-AE group) for 30 min/day, 5 days/wk, for 4 wk. A recently developed noninvasive bioreactance device was used to measure cardiac hemodynamics, and near-infrared spectroscopy was used to assess perfusion and oxygenation in the vastus lateralis (VL)/gastrocnemius (GN) muscles and frontal cerebral lobe (FC). Our results demonstrated that the H-AE group had a larger improvement in aerobic capacity compared with the N-E group. Both H-RE and H-AE ameliorated the suppression of cardiac stroke volume and the GN hyperemic response (Atotal Hb/min) and reoxygenation rate by acute 12% O2 exposure. Simultaneously, the two hypoxic interventions enhanced perfusion (Atotal Hb) and O2 extraction [AdeoxyHb] of the VL muscle during the 12% O 2 exercise. Although acute 12% O2 exercise decreased oxygenation ($\Delta$O2Hb) of the FC, none of the 4-wk interventions influenced the cerebral perfusion, and oxygenation during normoxic/ hypoxic exercise tests. Therefore, we conclude that moderate hypoxic exercise training improves cardiopulmonary fitness and increases resistance to disturbance of cardiac hemodynamics by severe hypoxia, concurrence with enhancing O2 delivery/utilization in skeletal muscles but not cerebral tissues.

abstract = {Key points: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of rotational axis position (RAP and thus g-gradient) during short-arm human centrifugation (SAHC) upon cardiovascular responses, cerebral perfusion and g-tolerance. In 10 male and 10 female participants, 10 min passive SAHC runs were performed with the RAP above the head (P1), at the apex of the head (P2), or at heart level (P3), with foot-level Gz at 1.0 g, 1.7 g and 2.4 g. We hypothesized that movement of the RAP from above the head (the conventional position) towards the heart might reduce central hypovolaemia, limit cardiovascular responses, aid cerebral perfusion, and thus promote g-tolerance. Moving the RAP footward towards the heart decreased the cerebral tissue saturation index, calf circumference and heart rate responses to SAHC, thereby promoting g-tolerance. Our results also suggest that RAP, and thus g-gradient, warrants further investigation as it may support use as a holistic spaceflight countermeasure. Abstract: Artificial gravity (AG) through short-arm human centrifugation (SAHC) has been proposed as a holistic spaceflight countermeasure. Movement of the rotational axis position (RAP) from above the head towards the heart may reduce central hypovolaemia, aid cerebral perfusion, and thus promote g-tolerance. This study determined the effect of RAP upon cardiovascular responses, peripheral blood displacement (i.e. central hypovolaemia), cerebral perfusion and g-tolerance, and their inter-relationships. Twenty (10 male) healthy participants (26.2 ± 4.0 years) underwent nine (following a familiarization run) randomized 10 min passive SAHC runs with RAP set above the head (P1), at the apex of the head (P2), or at heart level (P3) with foot-level Gz at 1.0 g, 1.7 g and 2.4 g. Cerebral tissue saturation index (cTSI, cerebral perfusion surrogate), calf circumference (CC, central hypovolaemia), heart rate (HR) and digital heart-level mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) were continuously recorded, in addition to incidence of pre-syncopal symptoms (PSS). $\Delta$CC and $\Delta$HR increases were attenuated from P1 to P3 ($\Delta$CC: 5.46 ± 0.54 mm to 2.23 ± 0.42 mm; $\Delta$HR: 50 ± 4 bpm to 8 ± 2 bpm, P ' 0.05). In addition, $\Delta$cTSI decrements were also attenuated ($\Delta$cTSI: −2.85 ± 0.48% to −0.95 ± 0.34%, P ' 0.05) and PSS incidence lower in P3 than P1 (P ' 0.05). A positive linear relationship was observed between $\Delta$CC and $\Delta$HR with increasing +Gz, and a negative relationship between $\Delta$CC and $\Delta$cTSI, both independent of RAP. Our data suggest that movement of RAP towards the heart (reduced g-gradient), independent of foot-level Gz, leads to improved g-tolerance. Further investigations are required to assess the effect of differential baroreceptor feedback (i.e. aortic–carotid g-gradient).},

Low-impact high-intensity interval exercise MO responses in the exercise and recovery stage are still unclear. We compared the differences in MO and physiological parameters between high-intensity interval water-based exercise (WHIIE) and high-intensity interval land bike ergonomic exercise (LBEHIIE) in postmenopausal women. Eleven postmenopausal women completed WHIIE or LBEHIIE in counter-balanced order. Eight sets were performed and each exercise set included high intensity with 80% heart rate reserve (HRR) in 30 s and dynamic recovery with 50% HRR in 90 s. Muscle tissue oxygen saturation index (TSI), total hemoglobin (tHb), oxy-hemoglobin (O2Hb), and deoxy-hemoglobin (HHb) were recorded. Blood lactate, heart rate and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were measured at pre and post-exercise. Under similar exercise intensity, RPE in WHIIE was lower than that in LBEHIIE. The heart rate in WHIIE was lower than that in LBEHIIE at 1 and 2 min post-exercise. During the dynamic recovery, TSI, tHb, and O2Hb in water were higher than on land. A negative correlation was found between the change in TSI and lactate concentration (r = − 0.664). WHIIE produced greater muscle oxygenation during dynamic recovery. Muscle TSI% was inversely related to blood lactate concentration during exercise in water.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that muscle alterations cannot totally explain peripheral muscle weakness in COPD. Cerebral abnormalities in COPD are well documented but have never been implicated in muscle torque production. The purpose of this study was to assess the neural correlates of quadriceps torque control in COPD patients. Fifteen patients (FEV1 54.1±3.6% predicted) and 15 age- and sex-matched healthy controls performed maximal (MVCs) and submaximal (SVCs) voluntary contractions at 10, 30 and 50% of the maximal voluntary torque of the knee extensors. Neural activity was quantified with changes in functional near-infrared spectroscopy oxyhemoglobin (fNIRS-HbO) over the contralateral primary motor (M1), primary somatosensory (S1), premotor (PMC) and prefrontal (PFC) cortical areas. In parallel to the lower muscle torque, the COPD patients showed lower increase in HbO than healthy controls over the M1 (p<0.05), PMC (p<0.05) and PFC areas (p<0.01) during MVCs. In addition, they exhibited lower HbO changes over the M1 (p<0.01), S1 (p<0.05) and PMC (p<0.01) areas during SVCs at 50% of maximal torque and altered motor control characterized by higher torque fluctuations around the target. The results show that low muscle force production is found in a context of reduced motor cortex activity, which is consistent with central nervous system involvement in COPD muscle weakness. {\textcopyright} 2014 Alexandre et al.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Several interventions are available to reduce the intensity and duration of the unwanted effects (eg, muscle soreness) associated with physical activity, such as massage, compression garments, and sequential pulse compression (SPC). Such interventions aim to increase blood flow to alleviate symptoms. However, there is a lack of evidence to support the use of SPC to alter total hemoglobin concentration (THb) in active individuals. OBJECTIVE: To examine the acute effects of a single session of SPC on hemoglobin concentration compared with a control condition. DESIGN: Single cohort, crossover design. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-four physically active and healthy participants (females = 12 and males = 22) completed the study. INTERVENTIONS: The authors randomly assigned participants to first receive the experimental (SPC) or control condition. Measures were recorded precondition and postcondition. Participants returned to the laboratory to complete the second condition ≥24 hours after the first condition. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relative changes in THb, deoxygenated hemoglobin, and oxygenated hemoglobin measures were recorded using near-infrared spectroscopy placed on the muscle belly of the medial gastrocnemius of the dominant limb. RESULTS: SPC significantly increased THb (P < .001, d = 0.505) and oxygenated hemoglobin (P < .001, d = 0.745) change scores compared with the control condition. No statistical difference in deoxygenated hemoglobin change scores was found between the SPC and control conditions, but a medium effect size suggests potential biological significance (P = .06, d = 0.339). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, SPC increases THb to the lower-extremity and may be a viable option in the management of muscle soreness related to physical activity.},

abstract = {Despite the social impact of repetitive strain injury (RSI), little is known about its pathophysiological mechanism. The main objective of this study was to assess the local muscle oxygenation (mVO2) and blood flow (mBF) of the forearm in individuals with RSI during isometric contractions of the forearm. We employed the non-invasive optical technique near-infrared spectroscopy to assess forearm VO2 and BF. These variables were assessed at 10%, 20%, and 40% of their individual maximal voluntary strength. Twenty-two patients with RSI symptoms in both arms (bilateral RSI) and 30 healthy age-matched subjects participated in this cross-sectional study. The results showed lower mVO2 during exercise and a reduced mBF after exercise. The results suggest that mVO2 and mVO2 are lower in the forearms of individuals with RSI compared with their controls at similar working intensities. This finding indicates that the underlying vasculature may be impaired. Although these findings contribute to the understanding of RSI, future research is necessary to further unravel the mechanisms of this area. {\textcopyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Specifically, significant increase in HbO in BA 44 was observed in both groups, while significant decrease in deoxyhaemoglobin (HbR) in BA 9 was observed only in the HP group and in BA 44 only in the LP group. These results jointly indicated BA 44 as one of the core neural correlates of MR in preschoolers, while BA 6 and BA 9 might also be involved in MR processing under a compensatory mechanism.},

abstract = {Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a common tool used to study oxygen availability and utilization during repeated-sprint exercise. However, there are inconsistent methods of smoothing and determining peaks and nadirs from the NIRS signal, which make interpretation and comparisons between studies difficult. To examine the effects of averaging method on deoxyhaemoglobin concentration ([HHb]) trends, nine males performed ten 10-s sprints, with 30 seconds of recovery, and six analysis methods were used for determining peaks and nadirs in the [HHb] signal. First, means were calculated over predetermined windows in the last 5 and 2 seconds of each sprint and recovery period. Second, moving 5-seconds and 2-seconds averages were also applied, and peaks/nadirs were determined for each 40-seconds sprint/recovery cycle. Third, a Butterworth filter was used to smooth the signal, and the resulting signal output was used to determine peaks and nadirs from predetermined time points and a rolling approach. Correlation and residual analysis showed that the Butterworth filter attenuated the “noise” in the signal, while maintaining the integrity of the raw data (r =.9892; mean standardized residual −9.71 × 103 ± 3.80). Means derived from predetermined windows, irrespective of length and data smoothing, underestimated the magnitude of peak and nadir [HHb] compared to a rolling mean approach. Consequently, sprint-induced metabolic changes (inferred from $\Delta$[HHb]) were underestimated. Based on these results, we suggest using a digital filter to smooth NIRS data, rather than an arithmetic mean, and a rolling approach to determine peaks and nadirs for accurate interpretation of muscle oxygenation trends.},

abstract = {Near Infrared Spectroscopy is a method that measures the brain's haemodynamic response. It is of interest in brain-computer interfaces where haemodynamic patterns in motor tasks are exploited to detect movement. However, the NIRS signal is usually corrupted with background biological processes, some of which are periodic or quasi-periodic in nature. Singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is a time-series decomposition method which separates a signal into a trend, oscillatory components and noise with minimal prior assumptions about their nature. Due to the frequency spectrum overlap of the movement response and of background processes such as Mayer waves, spectral filters are usually suboptimal. In this study, we perform SSA both in an online and a block fashion resulting in the removal of periodic components and in increased classification performance. Our study indicates that SSA is a practical method that can replace spectral filtering and is evaluated on healthy participants and patients with tetraplegia.},

abstract = {Background: Declines in gait parameters are common with aging and more pronounced in tasks with increased executive demand. However, the neural correlates of age-related gait impairments are not fully understood yet. Objectives: To investigate (a) the effects of aging on prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity and gait parameters during usual walking, obstacle crossing and dual-task walking and (b) the association between PFC activity and measures of gait and executive function. Methods: Eighty-eight healthy individuals were distributed into 6 age-groups: 20-25 (G20), 30-35 (G30), 40-45 (G40), 50-55 (G50), 60-65 (G60), and 70-75 years (G70). Participants walked overground under 3 conditions: usual walking, obstacle crossing, and dual-task walking. Changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin in the PFC were recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Gait spatiotemporal parameters were assessed using an electronic walkway. Executive function was assessed through validated tests. Results: Between-group differences on PFC activity were observed for all conditions. Multiple groups (ie, G30, G50, G60, and G70) showed increased PFC activity in at least one of the walking conditions. Young adults (G20 and G30) had the lowest levels of PFC activity while G60 had the highest levels. Only G70 showed reduced executive function and gait impairments (which were more pronounced during obstacle crossing and dual-task walking). PFC activity was related to gait and executive function. Conclusions: Aging causes a gradual increase in PFC activity during walking. This compensatory mechanism may reach the resource ceiling in the 70s, when reduced executive function limits its efficiency and gait impairments are observed.},

Here, we used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to examine haemodynamic responses evoked by neutral, positive and negative emotional pictures, matched for brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, spatial frequency and entropy. Emotion content modulated amplitude and latency of oxy, deoxy and total haemoglobin response peaks, and induced peripheral autonomic reactions. The processing of positive and negative pictures enhanced haemodynamic response amplitude, and this effect was paralleled by blood pressure changes. The processing of positive pictures was reflected in reduced haemodynamic response peak latency. Together these data suggest that the early visual cortex holds amplitude-dependent representation of stimulus salience and latency-dependent information regarding stimulus valence, providing new insight into affective interaction with sensory processing. {\textcopyright} 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.},

abstract = {Maximal strength training (MST) improves work efficiency. However, since blood flow is greatly dictated by muscle contractions in arms during exercise and vascular conductance is lower, it has been indicated that arms rely more upon adapting oxygen extraction than legs in response to the enhanced work efficiency. Thus, to investigate if metabolic and vascular responses are arm specific, we used Doppler-ultrasound and a catheter placed in the subclavian vein to measure blood flow and the arteriovenous oxygen difference during steady-state work in seven young men [24 ± 3 (SD) yr] following 6 wk of handgrip MST. As expected, MST improved maximal strength (49 ± 9 to 62 ± 10 kg) and the rate of force development (923 ± 224 to 1,086 ± 238 N/s), resulting in a reduced submaximal oxygen uptake (30 ± 9 to 24 ± 10 ml/min) and concomitantly increased work efficiency (9.3 ± 2.5 to 12.4 ± 3.9%) (all P < 0.05). In turn, the work efficiency improvement was associated with reduced blood flow (486 ± 102 to 395 ± 114 ml/min), mediated by a lower blood velocity (43 ± 8 to 32 ± 6 cm/s) (all P < 0.05). Conduit artery diameter and the arteriovenous oxygen difference remained unaltered. The maximal work test revealed an increased time to exhaustion (949 ± 239 to 1,102 ± 292 s) and maximal work rate (both P < 0.05) but no change in peak oxygen uptake. In conclusion, despite prior indications of metabolic and vascular limb-specific differences, these results reveal that improved work efficiency after small muscle mass strength training in the upper extremities is accompanied by a blood flow reduction and coheres with what has been documented for lower extremities. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Maximal strength training increases skeletal muscle work efficiency. Oxygen extraction has been indicated to be the adapting component with this increased work efficiency in arms. However, we document that decreased blood flow, achieved by blood velocity reduction, is the adapting mechanism responding to the improved aerobic metabolism in the forearm musculature.},

abstract = {Abstract: Rock-climbing performance is largely dependent on the endurance of the forearm flexors. Recently, it was reported that forearm flexor endurance in elite climbers is independent of the ability to regulate conduit artery (brachial) blood flow, suggesting that endurance is not primarily dependent on the ability of the brachial artery to deliver oxygen, but rather the ability of the muscle to perfuse and use oxygen, i.e., skeletal muscle oxidative capacity. Purpose: The aim of the study was to determine whether an index of oxidative capacity in the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) predicts the best sport climbing red-point grade within the last 6 months. Participants consisted of 46 sport climbers with a range of abilities. Methods: Using near-infrared spectroscopy, the oxidative capacity index of the FDP was assessed by calculating the half-time for tissue oxygen resaturation (O2HTR) following 3–5 min of ischemia. Results: Linear regression, adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and training experience, revealed a 1-s decrease in O2HTR was associated with an increase in red-point grade by 0.65 (95 % CI 0.35–0.94, Adj R2 = 0.53). Conclusions: Considering a grade of 0.4 separated the top four competitors in the 2015 International Federation Sport Climbing World Cup, this finding suggests that forearm flexor oxidative capacity index is an important determinant of rock-climbing performance.},

abstract = {Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) measures of post-occlusion skeletal muscle microvascular responsiveness demonstrate the microvascular dysfunction associated with ageing and age-related disease. However, the accessibility of CEUS is limited by the need for intravenous administration of ultrasound contrast agents and sophisticated imaging analysis. Alternative methods are required for the broader assessment of microvascular dysfunction in research and clinical settings. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the level of association and agreement between CEUS and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-derived measures of post-occlusion skeletal muscle microvascular responsiveness in older adults. Methods: During supine rest, participants (n=15, 67611 years) underwent 5 minutes of thigh cuff-occlusion (200mmHg). Post-occlusion CEUS measures of calf muscle microvascular responsiveness were made, including time to 95% peak acoustic intensity (TTP95AI) and the rate of rise (slope AI). Simultaneous measures, including time to 95% peak oxygenated haemoglobin (TTP95O2Hb) and slope O2Hb, were made using continuous-wave NIRS in the same muscle region. Results: There were strong correlations between TTP95measures derived from CEUS and NIRS (r=0.834, p=,0.001)and the corresponding measures of slope (r=0.735, p=0.004). The limits of agreement demonstrated by Bland Altman plot analyses for CEUS and NIRS-derived measures of TTP95(-9.67–1.98 s) and slope(-1.29–5.23%. s-1) were smaller than the minimum differences expected in people with microvascular dysfunction. Conclusions: The strong correlations and level of agreement in the present study support the use of NIRS as a non-invasive, portable and cost-effective method for assessing post-occlusion skeletal muscle microvascular responsiveness in older adults.},

Participants completed a series of five venous occlusion trials while seated at rest, and a series of 12 venous occlusion trials during a reactive hyperaemia induced by 5 min of forearm arterial occlusion.

(Formula presented.) was also reported as a cumulative value, wherein the first two, first three and first four cardiac beats were used to calculate muscle blood flow. We observed that (Formula presented.) was highest when calculated over the first cardiac beat during venous occlusions performed at rest and throughout reactive hyperaemia (P<0{\textperiodcentered}05). Moreover, the inclusion of more than one cardiac beat in the calculation of (Formula presented.) underestimated muscle blood flows, irrespective of the prevailing level of arterial inflow. These findings support the idea that venous occlusion per se affects the measurement of (Formula presented.) via the NIRS-VOT. Accordingly, it is recommended that (Formula presented.) is determined over the first cardiac beat when using the NIRS-VOT to assess microvascular blood flow of human forearm muscles.},

Concentrations of the chromophores oxygenated (O 2 Hb) and deoxygenated (HHb) haemoglobin and their sum (total haemoglobin) differ during bladder contraction in health and disease. A wireless device that incorporates three paired light emitting diodes (wavelengths 760 and 850 nanometers) and silicon photodiode detector collects data transcutaneously (10 Hz) with the emitter/detector over the bladder during spontaneous bladder emptying. Data analysis indicates comparable patterns of change in chromophore concentration in healthy children and adults (positive trend during voiding, predominantly due to elevated O 2 Hb), but different changes in symptomatic subjects with characteristic chromophore patterns identified for voiding dysfunction due to specific pathophysiologies: bladder outlet obstruction (males), overactive bladder (females), and nonneurogenic dysfunction (children). Comparison with NIRS muscle data suggests altered bladder haemodynamics and/or oxygenation may underlie voiding dysfunction offering new insight into the causal physiology. },

abstract = {, "Stress assessment by means of heart rate derived from functional near-infrared spectroscopy," Abstract. Many studies have been carried out in order to detect and quantify the level of mental stress by means of different physiological signals. From the physiological point of view, stress promptly affects brain and cardiac function; therefore, stress can be assessed by analyzing the brain-and heart-related signals more efficiently. Signals produced by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) of the brain together with the heart rate (HR) are employed to assess the stress induced by the Montreal Imaging Stress Task. Two different versions of the HR are used in this study. The first one is the commonly used HR derived from the electrocardiogram (ECG) and is considered as the reference HR (RHR). The other is the HR computed from the fNIRS signal (EHR) by means of an effective combinational algorithm. fNIRS and ECG signals were simultaneously recorded from 10 volunteers, and EHR and RHR are derived from them, respectively. Our results showed a high degree of agreement [r > 0.9, BAR (Bland Altman ratio) <5%] between the two HR. A principal component analysis/support vector machine-based algorithm for stress classification is developed and applied to the three measurements of fNIRS, EHR, and RHR and a classification accuracy of 78.8%, 94.6%, and 62.2% were obtained for the three measurements, respectively. From these observations, it can be concluded that the EHR carries more useful information with regards to the mental stress than the RHR and fNIRS signals. Therefore, EHR can be used alone or in combination with the fNIRS signal for a more accurate and real-time stress detection and classification.},

abstract = {Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that a repeated bout of eccentric exercise (ECC2) would result in smaller increase in the sensitivity of spinal nociceptive system, and smaller decrease in the local muscle blood oxygenation response in both the ipsilateral and the contralateral tibialis anterior muscle (TA) when compared with the initial bout (ECC1). It was hypothesized that the magnitude of the repeated bout effect (RBE) would be greater for the ipsilateral side than the contralateral side. Methods: Twenty-six healthy young men performed two bouts of high-intensity eccentric exercise of TA separated by 2 weeks. Half of the participants used the same leg for both bouts (IPSI) and the other half used the contralateral leg for ECC2 (CONTRA). Nociceptive withdrawal reflex threshold (NWRT) and local muscle blood oxygenation were assessed for the exercised TA muscle before, immediately after, and one day after exercise. Results: Significant decreases in NWRT and muscle oxygenation were observed after ECC1 (p < 0.05), but NWRT did not change after ECC2 in both groups. Smaller decreases in muscle oxygenation were observed after ECC2 than ECC1 in both groups with a similar magnitude of the difference between bouts, but an increase in muscle oxygen re-perfusion before ECC2 was only observed in the IPSI group. Conclusion: These results suggest that contralateral RBE was associated with spinal facilitation of the neuronal pathways situated at a homologous innervation level, and it is unlikely that oxygen re-perfusion improvement plays a major role in the contralateral RBE.},

abstract = {Summary: Exposure to vibration has traditionally been associated with compromised perfusion. This study investigated whether blood supply during whole body vibration (WBV), as an exercise modality, is in proportion to the metabolic demand by the contracting musculature. As a secondary aim, serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were assessed. Ten young healthy males performed WBV and dynamic shallow squatting (Squat) exercise at comparable levels of oxygen uptake for 3 min. Changes in oxygenated, deoxygenated and total haemoglobin (O2Hb, HHb and tHb, respectively) along with tissue oxygenation index (TOI) were measured continuously before, during and after the exercise by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS, Portamon, Artinis Medical Systems, Zetten, The Netherlands). Vascular endothelial growth factor-A blood levels before and after exercise were assessed by ELISA. Oxygen uptake was comparable in Squat and WBV (11{\textperiodcentered}4 and 10{\textperiodcentered}7 ml kg-1 min-1), respectively, P = 0{\textperiodcentered}49), as were all other cardiopulmonary variables. Near-infrared spectroscopy data were found to be non-stationary during and shortly after WBV, but stationary in Squat. There was an increase in O2Hb and TOI, and a decrease in HHb during the first 30 s of WBV, but no significant change was observed during Squat. No group difference was found in VEGF serum levels. These results suggest that oxygen supply during WBV is sufficient, and oxygenation is even enhanced during the first approximately 30 s. Most likely, the transient response is because of local vascular regulatory mechanisms and due to muscle contraction mechanics. This might become clinically relevant under pathological conditions, e.g. in vascular disorders. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {In the 50 year history of NIRS, biomedical applications in urology are recent. This review summarizes technical advances and novel enquiry that have led to hemodynamic monitoring of the testis, measures of renal function, evaluation of the pelvic floor in women, and interrogation of the bladder. An overview is given of how bladder spectroscopy has evolved and the evidence that non-invasive transcutaneous optical monitoring of the anterior bladder wall now enables variations in the organ's hemodynamics and oxygen supply and demand to be identified in real time. Research indicates that bladder blood flow and oxygenation differ in health and disease, and because NIRS monitors changes in the microcirculation bladder spectroscopy adds physiologic information not available by other means, including via the current invasive method for evaluation of voiding dysfunction. Confidence that bladder NIRS yields physiologic data comes from the patterns of chromophore change and tissue oxygen saturation observed corresponding to variations in these parameters in NIRS studies of other tissues in response to known physiologic events. Importantly, when interpreted based on this prior research, novel insight is gained about probable causal pathologies underlying bladder dysfunction. Studies to date warrant further research, continued refinement of instrumentation, extension of the scope of monitoring, and exploration of diagnostic software algorithms.},

abstract = {Fast cyclic movements and discrete motor acts are controlled differently, presumably because fast cyclic tasks are more automated, thereby depending on different circuits. If fast cyclic movements are made less predictable (e.g., by mixing frequencies), one would predict that their control will be less automated, requiring increased activity in motor cortical areas. The present functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) study investigated whether switching between frequencies increases the motor cortex activity compared to movements at single rates. Therefore, hand tapping at mixed frequencies ("mixed") was compared with hand tapping at 0.4 ("low frequency"), 0.8 ("mid-frequency"), and 1.4 Hz ("high frequency"). Oxy-hemoglobin (HbO) and deoxy-hemoglobin (HbR) concentration changes were studied in eleven healthy subjects with eight-channel fNIRS covering the hand motor cortex. Repeated-measures ANOVAs revealed significant main effects for the type of task in HbO and HbR. Post hoc analysis showed a larger HbO increase and HbR decrease for the mixed task compared to the low- and high-frequency conditions. In addition, the mid-frequency condition revealed a smaller HbR decrease compared to the mixed task. Single frequency data indicated the existence of separate motor control systems for low- and high-frequency movements. The increased activity for the mixed task is suggested to be the result of the recruitment of a voluntary command motor system instead of automated systems. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

However, it is unclear how prolonged sitting interacts with other common behaviors, including high- (HGI) and low- glycemic index (LGI) meals. Using a double- blind randomized cross- over design, this study evaluated the effects of prolonged (3 hr) sitting, with a high- (HGI; GI: 100) or low- glycemic index (LGI; GI: 19) meal on total brain blood flow (QBrain) and executive function. Eighteen young, healthy, active participants (22.6 [3.1] y, 33% F, 24.3 [3.7] kg/m2) sat for 3 hr after consuming an HGI or LGI meal. Using Doppler ultrasound to measure internal carotid (ICA) and vertebral (VA) artery blood flow, QBrain was calculated: (ICA blood flow + VA blood flow) × 2. Executive function was assessed using the Stroop Test and Trail Making Test— Part B. Brain fog was measured using a modified Borg Category Scale with Ratio properties (CR10). Following 3 hr of sitting, there was a significant decrease in QBrain with time (p = .001, ES = −0.26), though there were nonsignificant interaction (p = .216) and condition effects (p = .174). Brain fog increased (p = .024, ES = 0.27) and Stroop re- action time worsened with time (p = .001, ES: −0.40), though there were nonsignifi- cant condition effects for brain fog (p = .612) and the Stroop test (p = .445). There was a nonsignificant condition effect (p = .729) for the Trail Making Test— Part B, but completion time improved with time (p = .001, ES = −0.40). In conclusion, 3 hr of prolonged sitting decreases QBrain and executive function independent of glycemic index in young, healthy adults.},

abstract = {Background: Memory interference occurs when information (or memory) to be retrieved is interrupted by competing stimuli. Proactive interference (PI) occurs when previously acquired information interferes with newly acquired information, whereas retroactive interference (RI) occurs when newly acquired information interferes with previously acquired information. In animal paradigms, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been shown to help facilitate pattern separation, and ultimately, attenuate memory interference. Research evaluating the role of the PFC on memory interference among humans is, however, limited. The present study evaluated the relationship between PFC oxygenation on memory interference among humans, with the null hypothesis being that there is no association between PFC oxygenation and memory interference. Methods: A total of 74 participants (Mage = 20.8 years) completed the study. Participants completed a computerized memory interference task using the AB-DE AC-FG paradigm, with PFC oxyhemoglobin levels measured via functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Results: For PI, the change in oxygenated hemoglobin for encoding list 1 and retrieval of list 1 showed moderate evidence for the null hypothesis (BF01 = 4.05 and 3.28, respectively). For RI, the Bayesian analysis also established moderate evidence for the null hypothesis across all memory task time points. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates evidence of the null hypothesis regarding the relationship between PFC oxygenation and memory interference. Future work should continue to investigate this topic to identify mechanistic correlates of memory interference.},

abstract = {In this cross-sectional study, the relationship between noninvasively measured neurocardiovascular signal entropy and physical frailty was explored in a sample of community-dwelling older adults from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA). The hypothesis under investigation was that dysfunction in the neurovascular and cardiovascular systems, as quantified by short-length signal complexity during a lying-to-stand test (active stand), could provide a marker for frailty. Frailty status (i.e., “non-frail”, “pre-frail”, and “frail”) was based on Fried's criteria (i.e., exhaustion, unexplained weight loss, weakness, slowness, and low physical activity). Approximate entropy (ApEn) and sample entropy (SampEn) were calculated during resting (lying down), active standing, and recovery phases. There was continuously measured blood pressure/heart rate data from 2645 individuals (53.0% female) and frontal lobe tissue oxygenation data from 2225 participants (52.3% female); both samples had a mean (SD) age of 64.3 (7.7) years. Results revealed statistically significant associations between neurocardiovascular signal entropy and frailty status. Entropy differences between non-frail and pre-frail/frail were greater during resting state compared with standing and recovery phases. Compared with ApEn, SampEn seemed to have better discriminating power between non-frail and pre-frail/frail individuals. The quantification of entropy in short length neurocardiovascular signals could provide a clinically useful marker of the multiple physiological dysregulations that underlie physical frailty.},

abstract = {Thirst is represented within the anterior cingulate and insular cortices, and may share some common neuroanatomical structures that are implicated with the regulation of mental fatigue. This novel study investigated whether thirst might modulate the subjective, behavioural, or neurophysiological representations of mental fatigue. In a crossover design, thirst was monitored in 15 males during 60 min of cycling in normothermic conditions. Participants either consumed water to the dictates of their thirst (sated), or fluid was withheld and replaced with periodic salt water mouth rinses (thirst). Following either satiety or thirst, a 60 min modified Stroop task was completed to evoke mental fatigue. Prefrontal cortex (PFC) haemodynamics were monitored throughout the prolonged task, and subjective perceptions of fatigue were reported through a visual analogue scale. Behavioural performance was quantified as the total number of Stroop task iterations completed in the mentally fatiguing task, and by collating response time and accuracy into the inverse efficiency score (IES) for each 5 min interval throughout the task. During thirst, fewer iterations were completed and poorer IES performance was evident toward the latter portion of the mentally fatiguing task. Compensatory elevations in PFC oxyhaemoglobin were produced in each condition, however, differed temporally, and were premature during thirst. A diminished capacity to sustain cognitive performance is likely the product of an inability to preserve the distribution of resources within the prefrontal cortex, due to heightened activation about thirst regulatory centres. These data provide novel insight into the relationship between thirst and mental fatigue, and suggest that drinking to the dictates of thirst may be a pertinent strategy to sustain prolonged cognitive performance.},

abstract = {Purpose: Speed skating leads to blood-flow restriction and deoxygenation in the lower limbs (especially the right leg) that may affect performance. Although the acute influence of such deoxygenation is not clearly understood, the authors tested whether remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) could modify muscular oxygenation and improve time-trial performance in that sport. Methods: Using a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, 9 elite speed skaters performed 1000-m on-ice time trials preceded by either RIPC of the upper limbs (3 × 5-min compression/5-min reperfusion cycles at 30 mm Hg >arterial systolic pressure) or placebo treatment (SHAM; 10 mm Hg). Changes in tissue saturation index, oxyhemoglobin–oxymyoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin–deoxymyoglobin, and total hemoglobin–myoglobin in the right vastus lateralis muscle were monitored using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Differences between RIPC and SHAM were analyzed using Cohen effect size (ES) ± 90% confidence limits and magnitude-based inferences. Results: Compared with SHAM, RIPC had a negligible effect on performance and NIRS variables. However, in a subgroup of sprinters (n = 5), RIPC likely lowered tissue saturation index at the beginning of the time trial (−6.1%; ES = −0.65) and likely increased deoxyhemoglobin–deoxymyoglobin at the beginning (3%; ES = 0.39), middle (2.9%; ES = 0.37), and end of the trial (−2.1%; ES = 0.27). In the middle section of the trial, these metabolic changes were concomitant with a possible increase in total hemoglobin–myoglobin. Conclusion: RIPC has no practical ergogenic impact on 1000-m long-track speed-skating performance in elite athletes. The relevance of using RIPC during training to increase physiological stress in sprinters particularly deserves further investigation.},

Results: Trypophobic images were found to increase both heart rate and heart rate variability, but only in individuals with high scores on the Trypophobia Questionnaire. Trypophobic images were also found to elicit larger haemodynamic responses in posterior cortical areas, but again only in individuals with high scores.

Measurement of absolute tissue oxygen saturation in both muscle and brain, and mapping of event related cortical hemodynamic responses using functional NIRS (fNIRS) have added specific measurement modalities. Wireless wearable systems and self-contained devices capable of measuring such modalities in addition to providing conventional monitoring of trends in oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin concentration from baseline have increased the scope of research, expanded the population readily monitored, and opened new clinical avenues for applications involving NIRS.

abstract = {Purpose: Above a given exercise intensity, rapid muscle fatigue will occur. We explored the possibility of assessing torque threshold for peripheral fatigue during single-legged repetitive isometric knee extensor exercise. We hypothesized this fatigue threshold to be related to the general aerobic fitness level and the so-called "critical torque" (CT) established with a recently validated 5-min all-out test. Methods: Seventeen healthy men (V̇O2max = 44.7-69.6 mL•kg•min) performed six submaximal (20%-55% maximal voluntary contraction [MVC]) 5-min bouts of 60 repetitive contractions (3-s on, 2-s off). Torque was changed between bouts in steps of 5% MVC to estimate the highest intensity (fatigue threshold) at which average changes in rsEMG, EMG median power frequency, and tissue deoxygenation (near-infrared spectroscopy) of the three superficial knee extensor muscles were still <5%, signifying steady-state exercise with minimal peripheral fatigue. On another occasion, one bout was performed in an all-out manner with end-test torque representing CT. Results: Fatigue threshold (40.0% ± 8.1% MVC) was related (r2 = 0.57, P < 0.05) to CT (53.1% ± 10.0% MVC), but it was consistently lower (P < 0.05) and only fatigue threshold was significantly related to V̇O2max (r2 = 0.68), and the first (r2 = 0.45) and second (r2 = 0.63) ventilatory threshold obtained during cycle ergometry. Conclusions: Performing submaximal bouts of knee extensor contractions, while monitoring EMG and deoxygenation, seems a feasible manner to estimate an aerobic capacity-related exercise intensity of peripheral fatigue onset. This test may be used to evaluate changes in endurance capacity of single muscle groups, without the necessity for all-out testing, which could be problematic with frail subjects. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the American College of Sports Medicine.},

abstract = {Indocyanine green (ICG) has excellent safety records and is widely used in medical diagnosis. Recently, a new method has been developed to estimate cerebral blood flow (CBF) using ICG in combination with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The new technique may be of wide clinical interest, as it is noninvasive and easy to perform at the bedside in stroke patients. Additionally, ICG with the use of specific wavelength lasers is documented to be effective in photodynamic therapy (PDT). Under normal conditions ICG does not cross the intact blood brain barrier (BBB). However, in patients with brain injuries where the BBB may be disturbed, ICG could accumulate in brain parenchyma and in combination with NIR-light exposure, phototoxicity could occur. The aim of the present study was to examine the possible toxicity of ICG in combination with NIRS in a specific setting for CBF measurements. In five rats with mannitol induced BBB breakdown no traces of ICG were found during spectrophotometric analysis of the brain cell suspensions. In ten rats with disrupted BBB there were no significant increases of brain temperature or histological signs of brain damage following 1 h NIR-light exposure after ICG injection. The existing literature concerning the application of ICG in combination with NIR light is reviewed. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Corsi block-tapping test (CBT) is an old neuropsychological test that, requiring the storage and the reproduction of spatial locations, assesses spatial working memory (WM). Despite its wide use in clinical practice, the specific contribution of prefrontal cortex (PFC) subregions during CBT execution has not been clarified yet. Considering the importance of spatial WM in daily life and the well-known role of ventrolateral-PFC/dorsolateral-PFC (VLPFC/DLPFC) in WM processes, the present study was aimed at investigating, by a 20-channel functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) system (including four short-separation channels), the hemodynamic response of the VLPFC/DLPFC during a computerized version of the CBT. Thirty-nine university students were asked to perform CBT standard version (CBTs), block-suppression CBT (CBTb), and control task (CBTc). A VLPFC activation during CBTs and a DLPFC activation during CBTb were hypothesized. The results of the Bayesian analysis have not shown a delineated specific activation of VLPFC/DLPFC during either CBTs or CBTb. These results together with the related ones obtained by others using fMRI are not sufficient to definitively state the role of the PFC subregions during CBT execution. The adoption of high-density diffuse optical tomography would be helpful in further exploration of the PFC involvement in spatial WM tasks.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 SPIE Background: Overactivity of the bladder (OAB) affects 20% of people globally, causing urgency to void and incontinence of urine (UI)). OAB has a multi-factorial causation. Problematically current tests are invasive and provide limited information. Recent advances in NIRS technology now offer non-invasive evaluation of brain neuroexcitation and bladder hemodynamics/oxygenation related to micturition. We tested the hypothesis that brain and bladder parameters can be monitored simultaneously with patient-controlled quantification of bladder sensation, and that brain-mediated control impacts UI in OAB. Methods: A symptomatic patient (OAB) and asymptomatic control were monitored during spontaneous bladder filling to capacity with fNIRS of the anterior cortex and continuous wave NIRS of the bladder while using a validated patient-controlled sensory meter. Changes in oxygenated, de-oxygenated and total hemoglobin in brain and bladder were recorded, and sensory events (bladder fullness/urgency to void) documented. Results: In the asymptomatic control fNIRS-derived neuroexcitation was evident when the bladder filled to capacity, increased at decision to void, was most intense during voiding, and waned thereafter. The OAB subject showed progressive increase in neuroexcitation from documenting a desire to void, to recording sensing urgency (imminent UI). At this point a distractor stimulus occurred (unexpected phone call), the sensation of urgency waned and an abrupt decrease in cortical oxyhemoglobin concentration was evident. Conclusion: Simultaneous brain fNIRS, bladder NIRS and sensation quantification is feasible and adds to OAB evaluation. fNIRS-derived neuroexcitation occurs in association with sensed voiding events. The attenuation of urgency/UI by a distractor stimulus implies brain-mediated mechanisms are integral to OAB.},

Thirteen team-sport athletes (22±3yr) performed 6 repeated maximal sprints with (RSS, 6×[2×12.5m]) or without (RS, 6×25m) changes of direction. Best and mean running time, percentage speed decrement (%Dec), pulmonary oxygen uptake (VO, vastus lateralis deoxygenation (Hb and [La]were calculated for each condition. Best and mean times for both protocols were largely correlated (r=0.63 and r=0.78, respectively), and were almost certainly higher for RSS compared with RS (e.g., 5.30±0.17 vs. 4.09±0.17s for mean time, with the qualitative analysis revealing a 100% chance of RSS time being greater than RS). In contrast, %Dec waspossibly lower for RSS (2.6±1.2 vs. 3.2±1.3%, with a 79% chance of a real difference). Compared with RS,VO(40.4±4.2 vs. 38.9±3.8mL.min 1.kg1, with a 90% chance of a real difference) and [La](10.0±1.7 vs. 9.3±2.4mmol.L1, with a 70% chance of a real difference) werepossibly higher. Conversely, there were no differences in Hb(11.5±3.2 vs. 10.9±3.0M, with the comparison rated asunclear). To conclude, the present results suggest that the ability to repeat sprints can be considered as a general quality. They also suggest that repeated shuttle sprints might be an effective training practice for eliciting a greater systemic physiological load, but perhaps not a greater loading of the vastus lateralis. {\textcopyright} Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart {\textperiodcentered} New York.},

abstract = {The Corsi Block-Tapping test (CBT) is a measure of spatial working memory (WM) in clinical practice, requiring an examinee to reproduce sequences of cubes tapped by an examiner. CBT implies complementary behaviors in the examiners and the examinees, as they have to attend a precise turn taking. Previous studies demonstrated that the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) is activated during CBT, but scarce evidence is available on the neural correlates of CBT in the real setting. We assessed PFC activity in dyads of examiner–examinee participants while completing the real version of CBT, during conditions of increasing and exceeding workload. This procedure allowed to investigate whether brain activity in the dyads is coordinated. Results in the examinees showed that PFC activity was higher when the workload approached or reached participants' spatial WM span, and lower during workload conditions that were largely below or above their span. Interestingly, findings in the examiners paralleled the ones in the examinees, as examiners' brain activity increased and decreased in a similar way as the examinees' one. In the examiners, higher left-hemisphere activity was observed suggesting the likely activation of non-spatial WM processes. Data support a bell-shaped relationship between cognitive load and brain activity, and provide original insights on the cognitive processes activated in the examiner during CBT.},

abstract = {CHF (chronic heart failure) is associated with a prolonged recovery of skeletal muscle energy stores following submaximal exercise, limiting the ability to perform repetitive daily activities. However, the pathophysiological background of this impairment is not well established. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether muscle metabolic recovery following submaximal exercise in patients with CHF is limited by O2 delivery or O2 utilization. A total of 13 stable CHF patients (New York Heart Association classes II-III) and eight healthy subjects, matched for age and BMI (body mass index), were included. All subjects performed repetitive submaximal dynamic single leg extensions in the supine position. Post-exercise PCr (phosphocreatine) resynthesis was assessed by 31P-MRS (magnetic resonance spectroscopy). NIRS (near-IR spectroscopy) was applied simultaneously, using the rate of decrease in HHb (deoxygenated haemoglobin) as an index of post-exercise muscle re-oxygenation. As expected, PCr recovery was slower in CHF patients than in control subjects (time constant, 47 ± 10 compared with 35 ± 12 s respectively; P=0.04). HHb recovery kinetics were also prolonged in CHF patients (mean response time, 74±41 compared with 44±17 s respectively; P=0.04). In the patient group, HHb recovery kinetics were slower than PCr recovery kinetics (P=0.02), whereas no difference existed in the control group (P=0.32). In conclusion, prolonged metabolic recovery in CHF patients is associated with an even slower muscle tissue re-oxygenation, indicating a lower O2 delivery relative to metabolic demands. Therefore we postulate that the impaired ability to perform repetitive daily activities in these patients depends more on a reduced muscle blood flow than on limitations in O2 utilization. {\textcopyright} The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2010 Biochemical Society.},

abstract = {The modified Oxford maneuver is the reference standard for assessing arterial baroreflex function. The maneuver comprises a systemic bolus injection of 100 $\mu$g sodium nitroprusside (SNP) followed by 150 $\mu$g phenylephrine (PE). On the one hand, this results in an increase in oxyhemoglobin and total hemoglobin followed by a decrease within the cerebral sample volume illuminated by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). On the other hand, it produces a decrease in cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv) within the middle cerebral artery (MCA) during SNP and an increase in CBFv during PE as measured by transcranial Doppler ultrasound. To resolve this apparent discrepancy, we hypothesized that SNP dilates, whereas PE constricts, the MCA. We combined transcranial Doppler ultrasound of the right MCA with NIRS illuminating the right frontal cortex in 12 supine healthy subjects 18-24 yr old. Assuming constant O2 consumption and venous saturation, as estimated by partial venous occlusion plethysmography, we used conservation of mass (continuity) equations to estimate the changes in arterial inflow ($\Delta$Qa) and venous outflow ($\Delta$Qv) of the NIRS-illuminated area. Oxyhemoglobin and total hemoglobin, respectively, increased by 13.6 ± 1.6 and 15.2 ± 1.4 $\mu$mol/kg brain tissue with SNP despite hypotension and decreased by 6 ± 1 and 7 ± 1 $\mu$mol/kg with PE despite hypertension. SNP increased $\Delta$Qa by 0.36 ±.03 $\mu$mol{\textperiodcentered}kg-1{\textperiodcentered}s-1 (21.6 $\mu$mol{\textperiodcentered}kg-1{\textperiodcentered}min-1), whereas CBFv decreased from 71 ± 2 to 62 ± 2 cm/s.

These results are consistent with dilation of the MCA by SNP and constriction by PE. {\textcopyright} 2013 the American Physiological Society.},

We hypothesized that the variation in PaCO2 (hyper- or hypocapnia) could impact $\Delta$CO2, partly through microcirculation adaptations. Fifteen healthy males volunteered to participate. For hypocapnia condition (hCO2), the subjects were asked to hyperventilate, while they were asked to breathe a gas mixture containing 8 % CO2 for hypercapnia condition (HCO2). The 2 conditions were randomly assigned. Blood gases were measured at baseline before each condition, and after 5–7 min of either hCO2 or HCO2 condition. Microcirculation was assessed by the muscle reoxygenation slope measured with near infrared spectroscopy following a vascular occlusion test and by skin circulation with in vivo reflectance confocal microscopy. $\Delta$CO2 was significantly increased with hCO2 while it tended to decrease with HCO2 (non-significant). HCO2 induced a moderate increase of the resaturation slope of NIRS oxygenation. Skin microcirculatory blood flow significantly dropped with hCO2, while it remained unchanged with hypercapnia. Our results warrant cautious interpretation of $\Delta$CO2 as an indicator of tissue perfusion during respiratory alkalosis.},

abstract = {Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) uses the relative absorption of light at 850 and 760 nm to determine skeletal muscle oxygen saturation. Previous studies have used the ratio of both signals to report muscle oxygen saturation. Purpose: The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the different approaches used to represent muscle oxygen saturation and to evaluate the pulsations of oxygenated hemoglobin/myoglobin (O2heme) and deoxygenated hemoglobin/myoglobin (Heme) signals. Method: Twelve participants, aged 20-29 years, were tested on the forearm flexor muscles using continuous-wave NIRS at rest. Measurements were taken during 2-3 min rest, physiological calibration (5 min ischemia), and reperfusion. Ten participants were included in the study analysis. Results: There was a significant difference in pulse size between O2heme and Heme signals at the three locations (p < 0.05). Resting oxygen saturation was 58.8% + 9.2%, 69.6% + 3.9%, and 89.2% + 6.9% when calibrated using O2heme, the tissue oxygenation/saturation index (TSI), and Heme, respectively. Conclusion: The difference in magnitude of O2heme and Heme pulses with each heartbeat might suggest different anatomical locations of these signals, for which calibrating with just one of the signals instead of the ratio of both is proposed. Calculations of physiological calibration must account for increased blood volume in the tissue because of the changes in blood volume, which appear to be primarily from the O2heme signal. Resting oxygen levels calibrated with Heme agree with theoretical oxygen saturation.},

The data of four subjects was acquired using mental arithmetic tasks and motor imageries of the left- and right-hand. The EEG data were band-pass filtered to obtain the activity (8∼18 Hz). The modified Beer-Lambert law (MBLL) was used to convert the fNIRS data into oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin (HbO and HbR), respectively. A common threshold between the two modalities was established to define a common resting state. The support vector machines (SVM) was used for data classification. Three control commands were generated using the prefrontal and motor cortex data. The results show that EEG and fNIRS can be combined for better brain signal acquisition and classification for BCI.},

Because spectral absorption curves in the near-infrared range for fetal Hb are not identical to those for adult Hb, there is a potential for the measurements to be affected. This possibility has not previously been investigated. A quantitative analysis of cerebral oxygenation was undertaken in six newborn infants. The analysis used near-infrared spectroscopy multiplier coefficients derived from the absorption coefficients of both fetal and adult deoxygenated and oxygenated Hb. The results of both analyses were compared.

Exercise-based video gaming (exergaming) is a form of physical training that is delivered through virtual reality technology to facilitate motor learning and is efficacious in improving balance in aged populations. In addition, studies have shown that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS), when applied to the primary motor cortex, can augment motor learning when combined with physical training. However, no studies have investigated the combined effects of exergaming and tDCS on balance in people with PD. Methods/design: Twenty-four people with mild to moderate PD (Hoehn and Yahr scale score 2-4) will be randomly allocated to receive one of three interventions: (1) exergaming + a-tDCS, (2) exergaming + sham a-tDCS or (3) usual care. Participants in each exergaming group will perform two training sessions per week for 12 weeks. Each exergaming session will consist of a series of static and dynamic balance exercises using a rehabilitation-specific software programme (Jintronix) and 20 minutes of either sham or real a-tDCS (2 mA) delivered concurrently. Participants allocated to usual care will be asked to maintain their normal daily physical activities. All outcome measures will be assessed at baseline and at 6 weeks (mid-intervention), 12 weeks (post-intervention) and 24 weeks (3-month follow-up) after baseline. The primary outcome measure will be the Limits of Stability Test. Secondary outcomes will include measures of static balance, leg strength, functional capacity, cognitive task-related cortical activation, corticospinal excitability and inhibition, and cognitive inhibition. Discussion: This will be the first trial to target balance in people with PD with combined exergaming and a-tDCS. We hypothesise that improvements in balance, functional and neurophysiological outcome measures, and neurocognitive outcome measures will be greater and longer-lasting following concurrent exergaming and a-tDCS than in those receiving sham tDCS or usual care.},

abstract = {Reductions in prefrontal oxygenation near maximal exertion may limit exercise performance by impairing executive functions that influence the decision to stop exercising; however, whether deoxygenation also occurs in motor regions that more directly affect central motor drive is unknown. Multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy was used to compare changes in prefrontal, premotor, and motor cortices during exhaustive exercise. Twenty-three subjects performed two sequential, incremental cycle tests (25 W/min ramp) during acute hypoxia [79 Torr inspired PO2 (PIO2)] and normoxia (117 Torr PI O2) in an environmental chamber. Test order was balanced, and subjects were blinded to chamber pressure. In normoxia, bilateral prefrontal oxygenation was maintained during low- and moderate-intensity exercise but dropped 9.0 ± 10.7% (mean ± SD, P < 0.05) before exhaustion (maximal power = 305 ± 52 W). The pattern and magnitude of deoxygenation were similar in prefrontal, premotor, and motor regions (R2 > 0.94). In hypoxia, prefrontal oxygenation was reduced 11.1 ± 14.3% at rest (P < 0.01) and fell another 26.5 ± 19.5% (P < 0.01) at exhaustion (maximal power = 256 ± 38 W, P < 0.01). Correlations between regions were high (R2 > 0.61), but deoxygenation was greater in prefrontal than premotor and motor regions (P < 0.05). Prefrontal, premotor, and motor cortex deoxygenation during high-intensity exercise may contribute to an integrative decision to stop exercise. The accelerated rate of cortical deoxygenation in hypoxia may hasten this effect. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2009 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract = {Background High-intensity interval training (HIT) improves exercise capacity in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). Moreover, HIT was associated with improved resting cardiac function. However, the extent to which these improvements actually contribute to training-induced changes in exercise capacity remains to be elucidated. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of HIT on exercising central haemodynamics and skeletal muscle oxygenation. Methods Twenty-six CHF patients were randomised to a 12-week 4 × 4 minute HIT program at 85-95% of peak VO2 or usual care. Patients performed maximal and submaximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing with simultaneous assessment of cardiac output and skeletal muscle oxygenation by near infrared spectroscopy, using the amplitude of the tissue saturation index (TSIamp). Results Peak workload increased by 11% after HIT (p between group = 0.01) with a non-significant increase in peak VO2 (+7%, p between group = 0.19). Cardiac reserve increased by 37% after HIT (p within group = 0.03, p between group = 0.08); this increase was not related to improvements in peak workload. Oxygen uptake recovery kinetics after submaximal exercise were accelerated by 20% (p between group = 0.02); this improvement was related to a decrease in TSIamp (r = 0.71, p = 0.03), but not to changes in cardiac output kinetics. Conclusion HIT induced improvements in maximal exercise capacity and exercising haemodynamics at peak exercise. Improvements in recovery after submaximal exercise were associated with attenuated skeletal muscle deoxygenation during submaximal exercise, but not with changes in cardiac output kinetics, suggesting that the effect of HIT on submaximal exercise capacity is mediated by improved microvascular oxygen delivery-to-utilisation matching.},

@article{Manfredini2015,
abstract = {Background: Skeletal muscle dysfunction and poor exercise tolerance are hallmarks of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Noninvasively measured (near-infrared spectroscopy, NIRS) resting muscle oxygen consumption (rmVO2) is a biomarker of muscle dysfunction, which can be applied to study the severity and the reversibility of ESRD myopathy. We tested the hypothesis that deconditioning is a relevant factor in ESRD myopathy. Methods: The whole dialysis population (n = 59) of two of the eight centers participating into the EXCITE study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01255969), a randomized trial evaluating the effect of a home-based exercise program on the functional capacity of these patients was studied. Thirty-one patients were in the active arm (exercise group) and 28 in the control arm (no intervention). Normative data for rmVO2 were obtained from a group of 19 healthy subjects. Results: rmVO2 was twice higher (p < 0.001) in ESRDs patients (0.083 ± 0.034 ml/100 g/min) than in healthy subjects (0.041 ± 0.020 ml/100 g/min) indicating substantial skeletal muscle dysfunction in ESRD. rmVO2 correlated with resting heart rate (r = 0.34, p = 0.009) but was independent of age, dialysis vintage, biochemical, vascular and nutrition parameters. After the 6-month exercise program, rmVO2 reduced to 0.064 ± 0.024 ml/100 g/min (-23%, p < 0.001) in the exercise group indicating that skeletal muscle dysfunction is largely reversible but remained identical in the control group (0.082 ± 0.032 to 0.082 ± 0.031 ml/100 g/min). Conclusion: Deconditioning has a major role in ESRD myopathy. rmVO2 is a marker of physical deconditioning and has the potential for monitoring re-conditioning programs based on physical exercise in the ESRD population.},

abstract = {Background: In patients with obstructive lung disease, maintaining adequate ventilation during exercise may require greater contraction of the respiratory muscles, which may lead to a compression of muscle capillaries. Furthermore, dynamic hyperinflation (DH) is frequent during exercise in these patients, as it allows to reach higher expiratory flows and to satisfy respiratory demand. However, in such situation, intercostal muscles are likely to be stretched, which could affect the diameter of their capillaries. Thus, in a context of high level of expiratory resistance, intercostal muscle oxygenation may be disturbed during exercise, especially if DH occurs.Methods: Twelve participants (22±2 years) performed two sessions of moderate exercise (20 min) by breathing freely with and without a 20-cmH2O expiratory threshold load (ETL). Tissue saturation index (TSI) and concentration changes from rest (∆) in oxygenated ([O2Hb]) and total haemoglobin ([tHb]) were measured in the seventh intercostal space using near-infrared spectroscopy. Respiratory, metabolic and cardiac variables were likewise recorded.Results: Throughout exercise, dyspnea was higher and TSI was lower in ETL condition than in control (p<0.01). After a few minutes of exercise, ∆ [O2Hb] was also lower in ETL condition, as well as ∆ [tHb], when inspiratory capacity started to be reduced (p<0.05). Changes in [O2Hb] and dyspnea were correlated with changes in expiratory flow rate (Vt/Te) (r = -0.66 and 0.66. respectively; p<0.05).Conclusion: During exercise with ETL, impaired muscle oxygenation could be due to a limited increase in blood volume resulting from strong muscle contraction and/or occurrence of DH.},

abstract = {Increased oxygenated hemoglobin concentration of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been observed during linear walking, particularly when there is a high attention demand on the task, like in dual-task (DT) paradigms. Despite the knowledge that cognitive and motor demands depend on the complexity of the motor task, most studies have only focused on usual walking, while little is known for more challenging tasks, such as curved paths. To explore the relationship between cortical activation and gait biomechanics, 20 healthy young adults were asked to perform linear and curvilinear walking trajectories in single-task and DT conditions. PFC activation was assessed using functional near-infrared spectroscopy, while gait quality with four inertial measurement units. The Figure-of-8-Walk-Test was adopted as the curvilinear trajectory, with the “Serial 7s” test as concurrent cognitive task. Results show that walking along curvilinear trajectories in DT led to increased PFC activation and decreased motor performance. Under DT walking, the neural correlates of executive function and gait control tend to be modified in response to the cognitive resources imposed by the motor task. Being more representative of real-life situations, this approach to curved walking has the potential to reveal crucial information and to improve people' s balance, safety, and life's quality.},

abstract = {"Central" and "peripheral" limitations to oxidative metabolism during exercise were evaluated in 10 young males following a 35-day horizontal bed rest (BR). Incremental exercise (IE) and moderate- and heavy-intensity constant-load exercises (CLE) were carried out on a cycloergometer before and 1-2 days after BR. Pulmonary gas exchange, cardiac output (Q; by impedance cardiography), skeletal muscle (vastus lateralis), and brain (frontal cortex) oxygenation (by near-infrared spectroscopy) were determined. After BR, "peak" (values at exhaustion during IE) workload, peak O2 uptake (Vo2Peak), peak stroke volume, Qpeak, and peak skeletal muscle O2 extraction were decreased (-18, -18, -22, -19, and -33%, respectively). The gas exchange threshold was ∼60% of Vo2peak both before and after BR. At the highest workloads, brain oxygenation data suggest an increased O2 extraction, which was unaffected by BR. Vo2 kinetics during CLE (same percentage of peak workload before and after BR) were slower (time constant of the "fundamental" component: 31.1 ± 2.0 s before vs. 40.0 ± 2.2 s after BR); the amplitude of the "slow component" was unaffected by BR, thus it would be greater, after BR, at the same absolute workload. A more pronounced "overshoot" of skeletal muscle O 2 extraction during CLE was observed after BR, suggesting an impaired adjustment of skeletal muscle O2 delivery. The role of skeletal muscles in the impairment of oxidative metabolism during submaximal and maximal exercise after BR was identified. The reduced capacity of peak cardiovascular O2 delivery did not determine a "competition" for the available O2 between, skeletal muscles and brain.

abstract = {Background: We sought to determine if a pre-workout supplement (PWS), containing multiple ingredients thought to enhance blood flow, increases hyperemia associated with resistance training compared to placebo (PBO). Given the potential interaction with training loads/time-under-tension, we evaluated the hyperemic response at two different loads to failure. Methods: Thirty males participated in this double-blinded study. At visit 1, participants were randomly assigned to consume PWS (Reckless™) or PBO (maltodextrin and glycine) and performed four sets of leg extensions to failure at 30% or 80% of their 1-RM 45-min thereafter. 1-wk. later (visit 2), participants consumed the same supplement as before, but exercised at the alternate load. Heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), femoral artery blood flow, and plasma nitrate/nitrite (NOx) were assessed at baseline (BL), 45-min post-PWS/PBO consumption (PRE), and 5-min following the last set of leg extensions (POST). Vastus lateralis near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was employed during leg extension exercise. Repeated measures ANOVAs were performed with time, supplement, and load as independent variables and Bonferroni correction applied for multiple post-hoc comparisons. Data are reported as mean±SD. Results: With the 30% training load compared to 80%, significantly more repetitions were performed (p<0.05), but there was no difference in total volume load (p>0.05). NIRS derived minimum oxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb) was lower in the 80% load condition compared to 30% for all rest intervals between sets of exercise (p<0.0167). HR and BP did not vary as a function of supplement or load. Femoral artery blood flow at POST was higher independent of exercise load and treatment. However, a time*supplement*load interaction was observed revealing greater femoral artery blood flow with PWS compared to PBO at POST in the 80% (+56.8%; p=0.006) but not 30% load condition (+12.7%; p=0.476). Plasma NOx was $\sim$3-fold higher with PWS compared to PBO at PRE and POST (p<0.001). Conclusions: Compared to PBO, the PWS consumed herein augmented hyperemia following multiple sets to failure at 80% of 1-RM, but not 30%. This specificity may be a product of interaction with local perturbations (e.g., reduced tissue oxygenation levels [minimum O2Hb] in the 80% load condition) and/or muscle fiber recruitment.},

abstract = {Aims: We asked whether acclimatization to chronic hypoxia (CH) attenuates the level of supraspinal fatigue that is observed after locomotor exercise in acute hypoxia (AH). Methods: Seven recreationally active participants performed identical bouts of constant-load cycling (131 ± 39 W, 10.1 ± 1.4 min) on three occasions: (i) in normoxia (N, PIO2, 147.1 mmHg); (ii) in AH (FIO2, 0.105; PIO2, 73.8 mmHg); and (iii) after 14 days in CH (5260 m; PIO2, 75.7 mmHg). Throughout trials, prefrontal-cortex tissue oxygenation and middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAV) were assessed using near-infrared-spectroscopy and transcranial Doppler sonography. Pre- and post-exercise twitch responses to femoral nerve stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation were obtained to assess neuromuscular and corticospinal function. Results: In AH, prefrontal oxygenation declined at rest ($\Delta$7 ± 5%) and end-exercise ($\Delta$26 ± 13%) (P < 0.01); the degree of deoxygenation in AH was greater than N and CH (P < 0.05). The cerebral O2 delivery index (MCAV × CaO2) was 19 ± 14% lower during the final minute of exercise in AH compared to N (P = 0.013) and 20 ± 12% lower compared to CH (P = 0.040). Maximum voluntary and potentiated twitch force were decreased below baseline after exercise in AH and CH, but not N. Cortical voluntary activation decreased below baseline after exercise in AH ($\Delta$11%, P = 0.014), but not CH ($\Delta$6%, P = 0.174) or N ($\Delta$4%, P = 0.298). A twofold greater increase in motor-evoked potential amplitude was evident after exercise in CH compared to AH and N. Conclusion: These data indicate that exacerbated supraspinal fatigue after exercise in AH is attenuated after 14 days of acclimatization to altitude. The reduced development of supraspinal fatigue in CH may have been attributable to increased corticospinal excitability, consequent to an increased cerebral O2 delivery. {\textcopyright} 2014 Scandinavian Physiological Society.

abstract = {Lower-extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events and impaired exercise tolerance. We have previously reported that leg heat therapy (HT) applied using liquid-circulating trousers perfused with warm water increases leg blood flow and reduces blood pressure (BP) and the circulating levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1) in patients with symptomatic PAD. In this sham-controlled, randomized, crossover study, sixteen patients with symptomatic PAD (age 65 ± 5.7 years and ankle-brachial index: 0.69 ± 0.1) underwent a single 90-min session of HT or a sham treatment prior to a symptom-limited, graded cardiopulmonary exercise test on the treadmill. The primary outcome was the peak walking time (PWT) during the exercise test. Secondary outcomes included the claudication onset time (COT), resting and exercise BP, calf muscle oxygenation, pulmonary oxygen uptake (V̇O2), and plasma levels of ET-1, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-$\alpha$). Systolic, but not diastolic BP, was significantly lower ($\sim$7 mmHg, p <.05) during HT when compared to the sham treatment. There was also a trend for lower SBP throughout the exercise and the recovery period following HT (p =.057). While COT did not differ between treatments (p =.77), PWT tended to increase following HT (CON: 911 ± 69 s, HT: 954 ± 77 s, p =.059). Post-exercise plasma levels of ET-1 were also lower in the HT session (CON: 2.0 ± 0.1, HT: 1.7 ± 0.1, p =.02). Calf muscle oxygenation, V̇O2, COT, IL-6, and TNF-$\alpha$ did not differ between treatments. A single session of leg HT lowers BP and post-exercise circulating levels of ET-1 and may enhance treadmill walking performance in symptomatic PAD patients.},

The patient was tested after 12h withdrawal of dopamine medications in both an “OFF” and “ON” DBS session separated by 30min. The subject performed a computerised GoNoGo task with 3 alternating Go/ NoGo blocks of 30s duration (20 trials/block) interspersed with 30s rest. Reaction time (RT) and accuracy (omission-Om and commission-Cm errors) results were the average of the 3 Go/NoGo blocks. During performance of the Go/NoGo blocks, changes in oxygenated (O2Hb) and deoxygenated (HHb) haemoglobin concentrations were measured by a fNIRS system (Oxymon MkIII, Artinis Medical Systems) covering the bilateral PFC regions. Results/Discussion: Clinical motor performance (UPDRSIII) improved from OFF (31) to ON (20). RT during Go and NoGo was {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}40ms faster in OFF (460 and 364ms) than ON (516 and 407ms). Furthermore, the NoGo condition increased misses (Om) in ON (7{\%}) than OFF (0{\%}); while false alarms (Cm) were similarly increased in ON (27{\%}) and OFF (30{\%}). The Go and NoGo conditions increased bilateral PFC activation (i.e., increase in O2Hb and decrease in HHb). However, there was a general decrease in PFC activation in OFF relative to ON, and this was more obvious in Go than NoGo (see Fig. 1) Conclusion: These preliminary results indicate that STN-DBS modulates neurovascular responses in the bilateral PFC that are associated with response inhibition.},

abstract = {Purpose: Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) is commonly used in neuromuscular rehabilitation protocols, and its parameters selection substantially affects the characteristics of muscle activation. Here, we investigated the effects of short pulse width (200 µs) and higher intensity (short-high) NMES or long pulse width (1000 µs) and lower intensity (long-low) NMES on muscle mechanical output and fractional oxygen extraction. Muscle contractions were elicited with 100 Hz stimulation frequency, and the initial torque output was matched by adjusting stimulation intensity. Methods: Fourteen able-bodied and six spinal cord-injured (SCI) individuals participated in the study. The NMES protocol (75 isometric contractions, 1-s on–3-s off) targeting the knee extensors was performed with long-low or short-high NMES applied over the midline between anterior superior iliac spine and patella protrusion in two different days. Muscle work was estimated by torque–time integral, contractile properties by rate of torque development and half-relaxation time, and vastus lateralis fractional oxygen extraction was assessed by Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). Results: Torque–time integral elicited by the two NMES paradigms was similar throughout the stimulation protocol, with differences ranging between 1.4% (p = 0.877; able-bodied, mid-part of the protocol) and 9.9% (p = 0.147; SCI, mid-part of the protocol). Contractile properties were also comparable in the two NMES paradigms. However, long-low NMES resulted in higher fractional oxygen extraction in able-bodied (+ 36%; p = 0.006). Conclusion: Long-low and short-high NMES recruited quadriceps femoris motor units that demonstrated similar contractile and fatigability properties. However, long-low NMES conceivably resulted in the preferential recruitment of vastus lateralis muscle fibers as detected by NIRS.},

Objective: To verify if the MFR alters the tissue oxygenation of the trapezius muscle (TM) in subjects without the pain symptom in the evaluation day. Methods: The sample consisted of eight subjects with a mean age of 23 (± 6) years and a body mass index of 23.2 (±15.0) kg.m-2. Changes in muscle oxygenation were measured by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) (Portamon, Artinis, the Netherlands) in TM before and after 15 minutes of intervention. The proposed MFR protocol lasted approximately 10 minutes and consisted of pressures, stretching and myofascial slippage of the upper, middle and lower TM fibers. Data normality was performed using the Shapiro Wilk test and due to the parametric nature of the data, the paired t-test was used for pre and post intervention comparison. Results: There was a significant increase in the tissue saturation index (TSI) in the trapezius muscle (80.7±2.7% vs. 89.4±4.6%; p= 0.002) in the pre and post intervention comparison. The pre-post variation delta of oxyhemoglobin - O2 Hb (8.1±11.2 g/dL), deoxyhemoglobin - HHb (-0.72±1.6 g/dL) and total hemoglobin - tHB (7.4±12.3 g/dL) showed no significant difference. However, there was an increase in O2 Hb, tHB levels and a decrease in HHb. Conclusion: The findings showed that the MFR applied on trapezius muscle increased the TSI, which reflects on peripheral muscle oxygenation in subjects without pain in the day of evaluation.},

@thesis{Manzano2020,
abstract = {Cold exposure has been proposed as a potential tool to face obesitysince it is able to increase energy expenditure (i.e., cold induced thermogenesis –CIT). This increase is partially mediated by brown adipose tissue (BAT). Nevertheless, little is known yet about how CIT (specially its non-shivering component) and BATmetabolic activityare regulated, and which are theclinical implicationsof harnessingthem in humans. Furthermore, most physiological functions in our organism are under the control of the biological clock, which shows a tight link with disease in humans. However, to date it remains unknown whether CIT and BAT activity follow a diurnal/circadian rhythmicity, and whether they are related to the general functioning of the circadian system. Furthermore, whether exercise and physical activity are efficient strategies to recruit and activate BATstill needto be explored.Therefore, theoverall aim of the present Doctoral Thesis wasto studythe role of cold and the biological clock on energy balance in humans as well ason BAT; and toinvestigate whether exercise and physical activity could be potential strategiesto recruit and activate BATin humans. Mild cold elicits a modest increase in CIT and prompts a fat oxidative metabolism, especially during the initial moments of cold exposure (Study I).In addition,subjectsexposed to the coldest ambient temperature during their daily life have 3-5 times more BAT volume and activity-measured as 18F-fluordeoxygelucose (18F-FDG) uptake -compared to subjects who are exposed to a warmer ambient temperature (Study II). CIT and BAT 18F-FDG uptake do not seem to have diurnal variations (Study III), and the relationship between the daily rhythm of distal skin temperature-an overall indicator of the circadian system functioning-and BAT 18F-FDG uptake, is masked by the environmental temperature (Study II). In addition, sleepduration and qualityare not related to human BAT metabolic activity (Study IV). Anacutebout ofaerobic exercise does not induce significant changes in the protein concentrations of UCP-1 (and therefore BAT activity) in mice (Study V). Accordingly, physicalactivity levels and sedentary time are not related to BAT 18F-FDG uptake in young human adults (Study VI), neither to the regulation of browning markers, suggesting a negligible role for exercise and physical activity as potential strategies to recruit and activate human BAT. The results from the present Doctoral Thesisincrease our knowledge on the effects of cold on energyand BATmetabolism in humans, and on how the biological clock and related factors might affect them. In addition, it provides novel information on the search of potential strategies to improve BATfunction and browning of specific adipose depots.},

abstract = {Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive imaging approach for measuring brain activities based on changes in the cerebral concentrations of hemoglobin. Recently, statistical analysis based on a general linear model (GLM) has become popular. Here, to impose statistical significance on the activation detected by fNIRS, family-wise error (FWE) rate control is important. However, unlike fMRI, in which measurements are densely sampled on a regular lattice and Gaussian smoothing makes the resulting random field homogeneous, the random fields from fNIRS are inhomogeneous due to the interpolation from sparsely and irregularly distributed optode locations. Thus, tube formula based correction has been proposed to address this issue. However, Sun's tube formula cannot be used for general random fields such as F-statistics. To overcome these difficulties, we employ the expected Euler characteristic approach based on Lipschitz-Killing curvature (LKC) to control the family-wise error rate. We compared this correction method with Sun's tube formula for t-statistics to confirm the existing method. Based on this comparison, we show that covariance estimation should be modified to consider channel-wise least-square residual correlation. These new results supplement the existing tool of statistical parameter mapping for fNIRS. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Cardiovascular risk, predicted by peak O2 uptake (VO2peak), is increased in type 1 diabetes. We examined the contribution of central and peripheral mechanisms to VO2peak in physically active adults with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: Seven men with type 1 diabetes and 10 healthy age-, anthropometry-, and physical activity-matched men performed incremental cycling exercise until volitional fatigue. Alveolar gas exchange (turbine and mass spectrometry), cardiac function and systemic vascular resistance (impedance cardiography), and local active leg muscle deoxygenation and blood flow (near infrared spectroscopy) were monitored. Arterial-venous O2 difference was calculated (Fick principle). Blood volume (BV) (carbon monoxide rebreathing method) and glycemic control (glycosylated hemoglobin) were determined. RESULTS: The group with diabetes had lower VO2peak than controls (47 ± 5 vs 56 ± 7 mL{\textperiodcentered}min{\textperiodcentered}kg fat-free mass, P < 0.05). At peak exercise, fat-free mass-adjusted stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO) were lower and systemic vascular resistance was higher in the group with diabetes than those in controls (P < 0.05). Leg muscle blood flow was reduced independently of CO in the group with diabetes at peak exercise (P < 0.05), whereas arterial-venous O2 difference was similar in the groups throughout the exercise (P > 0.05). The group with diabetes had lower relative BV than controls (P < 0.01), and BV correlated positively with peak SV and peak CO (P < 0.001). In the group with diabetes, peak SV and peak CO correlated (P < 0.05) and peak leg muscle blood flow tended to correlate (P = 0.070) inversely with glycosylated hemoglobin. CONCLUSIONS: Both central and peripheral cardiovascular impairments limit VO2peak in physically active adults with type 1 diabetes. Importantly, central limitations, and probably peripheral limitations as well, are associated with glycemic control.},

This study was conducted with a dual purpose: to test the feasibility of using a combined electroencephalogram/functional near-infrared spectroscopy (EEG-fNIRS) SMR-based brain switch in patients with tetraplegia, and to examine the performance difference between motor imagery and motor attempt for this user group. A general improvement was found when using both EEG and fNIRS features for classification as compared to using the single-modality EEG classifier, with average classification rates of 79% for attempted movement and 70% for imagined movement. For the control group, rates of 87% and 79% were obtained, respectively, where the 'attempted movement' condition was replaced with 'actual movement.' A combined EEG-fNIRS system might be especially beneficial for users who lack sufficient control of current EEG-based brain switches. The average classification performance in the patient group for attempted movement was significantly higher than for imagined movement using the EEG-only as well as the combined classifier, arguing for the case of a paradigm shift in current brain switch research. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Aim: To investigate the effect of carbon monoxide (CO) in the inspired air as anticipated during peak hours of traffic in polluted megalopolises on cerebral, respiratory and leg muscle oxygenation during a constant-power test (CPT). In addition, since O 2 breathing is used to hasten elimination of CO from the blood, we examined the effect of breathing O 2 following exposure to CO on cerebral and muscle oxygenation during a subsequent exercise test under CO conditions. Methods: Nine men participated in three trials: (i) 3-h air exposure followed by a control CPT, (ii) 1-h air and 2-h CO (18.9ppm) exposure succeeded by a CPT under CO conditions (CPT COA), and (iii) 2-h CO and 1-h 100% normobaric O 2 exposure followed by a CPT under CO conditions (CPT COB). All exercise tests were performed at 85% of peak power output to exhaustion. Oxygenated ($\Delta$[O 2Hb]), deoxygenated ($\Delta$[HHb]) and total ($\Delta$[tHb]) haemoglobin in cerebral, intercostal and vastus lateralis muscles were monitored with near-infrared spectroscopy throughout the CPTs. Results: Performance time did not vary between trials. However, the vastus lateralis and intercostal $\Delta$[O 2Hb] and $\Delta$[tHb] were lower in CPT COA than in CPT. During the CPT COB, the intercostal $\Delta$[O 2Hb] and $\Delta$[tHb] were higher than in the CPT COA. There were no differences in cerebral oxygenation between the trials. Conclusion: Inspiration of 18.9ppm CO decreases oxygenation in the vastus lateralis and serratus anterior muscles, but does not affect performance. Breathing normobaric O 2 moderates the CO-induced reductions in muscle oxygenation, mainly in the intercostals, but does not affect endurance. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {Dr. Background-Inorganic nitrate (NO3-), abundant in certain vegetables, is converted to nitrite by bacteria in the oral cavity. Nitrite can be converted to nitric oxide in the setting of hypoxia. We tested the hypothesis that NO3- supplementation improves exercise capacity in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction via specific adaptations to exercise. Methods and Results-Seventeen subjects participated in this randomized, double-blind, crossover study comparing a single dose of NO3-rich beetroot juice (NO3-, 12.9 mmol) with an identical nitrate-depleted placebo. Subjects performed supine-cycle maximal-effort cardiopulmonary exercise tests, with measurements of cardiac output and skeletal muscle oxygenation. We also assessed skeletal muscle oxidative function. Study end points included exercise efficiency (total work/ total oxygen consumed), peak Vo2, total work performed, vasodilatory reserve, forearm mitochondrial oxidative function, and augmentation index (a marker of arterial wave reflections, measured via radial arterial tonometry). Supplementation increased plasma nitric oxide metabolites (median, 326 versus 10 $\mu$mol/L; P=0.0003), peak Vo2 (12.6±3.7 versus 11.6±3.1 mL O2min-1kg-1; P=0.005), and total work performed (55.6±35.3 versus 49.2±28.9 kJ; P=0.04). However, efficiency was unchanged. NO3- led to greater reductions in systemic vascular resistance (-42.4±16.6% versus-31.8±20.3%; P=0.03) and increases in cardiac output (121.2±59.9% versus 88.7±53.3%; P=0.006) with exercise. NO3- reduced aortic augmentation index (132.2±16.7% versus 141.4±21.9%; P=0.03) and tended to improve mitochondrial oxidative function. Conclusions-NO3- increased exercise capacity in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction by targeting peripheral abnormalities. Efficiency did not change as a result of parallel increases in total work and Vo2. NO3- increased exercise vasodilatory and cardiac output reserves. NO3- also reduced arterial wave reflections, which are linked to left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and remodeling.},

abstract = {International physical activity guidelines recommend that older adults accumulate 150 min/week of moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). It is unclear whether meeting this recommendation is associated with better higher-order cognitive functions and if so, what are the neurophysiological mechanisms responsible for such a relationship. We tested the hypothesis that meeting MVPA guidelines is associated with better executive function in older adults, and explored if greater increases in prefrontal cortex oxygenation are implicated. Older adults who did (active, n = 19; 251 ± 79 min/week) or who did not (inactive, n = 16; 89 ± 33 min/week) achieve activity guidelines were compared. Executive function was determined via a computerized Stroop task while changes in left prefrontal cortex oxygenation ($\Delta$O2Hb) were measured with functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Aerobic fitness (VO˙ 2peak) was determined using a graded, maximal cycle ergometry test. MVPA and sedentary time were objectively assessed over 5 days. Both groups had similar (both, P > 0.11) levels of aerobic fitness (24.9 ± 8.9 vs. 20.9 ± 5.6 ml/kg/min) and sedentary time (529 ± 60 vs. 571 ± 90 min/day). The active group had faster reaction times (1193 ± 230 vs. 1377 ± 239 ms, P < 0.001) and greater increases in prefrontal cortex $\Delta$O2Hb (9.4 ± 5.6 a.u vs. 5.8 ± 3.4 a.u, P = 0.04) during the most executively demanding Stroop condition than the Inactive group. Weekly MVPA was negatively correlated to executive function reaction times (r = − 0.37, P = 0.03) but positively correlated to the $\Delta$O2Hb responses (r = 0.39. P = 0.02) during the executive task. In older adults, meeting MVPA guidelines is associated with better executive function and larger increases in cerebral oxygenation among older adults.},

abstract = {Currently available near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) devices are unable to discriminate between arterial and venous blood, a potential source of artifact. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that oscillations in NIR signals at the respiratory and cardiac frequency could be attributed to venous and arterial blood, respectively, and thereby isolated. After written informed consent was obtained, a two-wavelength NIRS device was placed over the left frontal cortex in 20 volunteers. After 5 min of unimpeded spontaneous ventilation, an impedance threshold device (ITD, average resistance—7 cm H2O) was applied and an additional two minutes of data recorded. Tissue saturation (StO2) calculated at the ventilatory and cardiac frequencies was compared to non-pulsatile StO2, before and after application of the ITD using spectral peak and power algorithms. The ITD increased non-pulsatile cerebral saturation by 3.6 %. The ITD had no discernable effect on pulsatile estimates of StO2 at either the ventilatory or cardiac frequencies. StO2 estimated at the NIRS spectral peak from 0.75 to 1.75 Hz was 24 % higher than non-pulsatile StO2 (p = 0.0013). There were no other significant differences between pulsatile and non-pulsatile algorithms in the estimation of StO2. In 64 % of cases, both the low (ventilator) and high (cardiac) frequency estimates of StO2 were either both larger or both smaller than non-pulsatile StO2, suggesting that they were interrogating the same vascular bed. Frequency domain analysis cannot reliably separate NIRS waveforms into arterial and venous components.},

Objectives: To evaluate the effects of midazolam versus morphine infusion on cerebral oxygenation and hemodynamics in ventilated premature infants. Methods: 11 patients (GA 26.6-33.0 weeks, BW 780-2,335 g) were sedated with midazolam (loading dose 0.2 mg/kg, maintenance 0.2 mg/kg/h) and 10 patients (GA 26.4-33.3 weeks, BW 842-1,955 g) were sedated with morphine (loading dose 0.05 mg/kg, maintenance 0.01 mg/kg/h). Changes in oxyhemoglobin ($\Delta$cO2Hb) and deoxyhemoglobin ($\Delta$cHHb) were assessed using near infrared spectrophotometry. Changes in cHbD (= $\Delta$cO2Hb - $\Delta$cHHb) reflect changes in cerebral blood oxygenation and changes in concentration of total hemoglobin ($\Delta$ctHb = $\Delta$cO2Hb + $\Delta$cHHb) represent changes in cerebral blood volume ($\Delta$CBV). Changes in cerebral blood flow velocity ($\Delta$CBFV) were intermittently measured using Doppler ultrasound. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), arterial oxygen saturation (saO2) and transcutaneous measured pO 2 (tcpO2) and pCO2 (tcpCO2) were continuously registered. Statistical analyses were carried out using linear mixed models to account for the longitudinal character study design. Results: Within 15 min after the loading dose of midazolam, a decrease in saO 2, tcpO2 and cHbD was observed in 5/11 infants. In addition, a fall in MABP and CBFV was observed 15 min after midazolam administration. Immediately after morphine infusion a decrease in saO 2, tcpO2 and cHbD was observed in 6/10 infants. Furthermore, morphine infusion resulted in a persistent increase in CBV.

abstract = {Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has been used with moderate success in many passive brain-computer interface applications. Much of this recent work has been focused on differentiating between various states shortly following discrete stimuli. We aim to extend these results to the to the assessment of an operator's mental state during the complex environment encountered by helicopter pilots. This work presents initial efforts made in this direction. Stepping though phases of increasing complexity, fNIRS data from the pre-frontal cortex were collected and analyzed from four participants as they completed n-back tests, discrete flight simulator tasks, and during abbreviated simulated medevac mission scenarios. Data collected during the n-back tests and discrete simulator tasks were found not to be significantly clustered in the feature space considered. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was trained on the n-back data to differentiate between workload levels and applied to the discrete simulator task data achieving an average 3-class classification accuracy of 57% and an average 2-class classification accuracy of 68%. Finally, this classifier was applied to the data collected during the simulated mission and the result was found to be only weakly correlated with the participant's subjectively-Assessed workload. Due to these results, it is not yet clear how an n-back-Trained classifier could be utilized to augment an adaptive crew support system. We suggest that the levels of 'workload' measured by an n-back test should not be expected to 'map onto' other, more complex, subjective evaluations of 'workload.' Strong hemodynamic responses observed during mission execution however, suggest fNIRS may contain data relevant for the augmentation of an adaptive assistant system.},

abstract = {Most research on the relationship between driver fatigue, driving comfort, stability and other factors related to driving has consisted subjective assessments via surveys. Bio-signal measurements allow more objective evaluations but the measurement processes and types are very complicated, and measurement signals are sensitive to noise. To address this issue, this paper attempts to quantify driver fatigue by measuring and analyzing hemodynamic responses with near-infrared spectroscopy. The oxygen concentration changes in the erector spinae muscle were measured for the same subjects when driving a vehicle on a highway for a long time, in one of two driving postures: posture A based on the seat status of the average male body type in South Korea (a 107.7° torso angle, 109.1° chair back angle and 561.0 mm seat x-axis position posture) and Posture B with the chair back angle adjusted by −10° from posture A and the seat moved 4 cm back. A survey was carried out on the degree of lumbar discomfort. The analysis of the degree of relative fatigue, based on driver posture utilizing a mathematical model for the physiological system of lower-back fatigue, showed that posture B is relatively uncomfortable compared to posture A by approximately 41%. The results of analyzing the degree of relative discomfort with regard to driver posture using a mathematical model allow the verification that interpreting the relative degree of discomfort based on the changes in the oxygen concentration at a particular time is possible, and the experimental results show the usefulness of the proposed method.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of an 8-week endurance training program on repeated-sprint (RS) performance and post-sprints muscle reoxygenation rate in 18 moderately trained males (34 ± 5 years). Maximal aerobic speed (MAS), 10 km running and RS (2 × 15-s shuttle-sprints, interspersed with 15 s of passive recovery) performance were assessed before and after the training intervention. Total distance covered (TD) and the percentage of distance decrement (%Dec) were calculated for RS. Between-sprints muscle reoxygenation rate (Reoxy rate) was assessed with near-infrared spectroscopy during RS before and after training. After training, MAS (+9.8 ± 5.8%, with 100% chances to observe a substantial improvement), 10 km time (-6.2 ± 5.3%, 99%), TD (+9.6 ± 7.7%, 98%), %Dec (-25.6 ± 73.6%, 93%) and Reoxy rate (+152.4 ± 308.1%, 95%) were improved. The improvement of Reoxy rate was largely correlated with improvements in MAS [r = 0.63 (90% CL, 0.31;-0.82)] and %Dec [r = -0.52 (-0.15;-0.76)]. Present findings confirm the beneficial effect of endurance training on post-sprint muscle reoxygenation rate, which is likely to participate in the improvement of repeated-sprint ability after training. These data also confirm the importance of aerobic conditioning in sports, where repeating high-intensity/maximal efforts within a short time-period are required. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Background: Elastic compression therapy (CT) in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) may compromise arterial perfusion. We evaluated the feasibility of a toe-flexion test, which quantifies dynamic foot perfusion by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), for the assessment of hemodynamic sustainability of CT in PAD patients with CVI. Patients and methods: In this prospective observational study, PAD patients aged 50–85 with combined CVI at CEAP stages II–IV were studied. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) was measured, and foot perfusion was determined after 10 consecutive toe-flexion movements with NIRS sensors placed on the dorsum of each foot. Knee-high open-toe compression stockings were applied, and the degree of compression was measured. Toflex-area was determined by calculating the area under the curve of the oxygenated hemoglobin track recorded by NIRS. A toflex-area reduction > 20 % following CT was arbitrarily defined to identify limbs of patients with improved foot perfusion. These subjects received CT to be worn and a diary to report adherence and symptoms. Results: Forty-seven PAD patients (74 ± 9 years; ABI 0.67 ± 0.24) with CVI were enrolled. For all legs, superimposable toflex-areas were observed for the first two attempts (ICC 0.92). Following application of CT (17 ± 2 mmHg), the toflex-area improved (from –162 ± 110 a.u. to –112 ± 104 a.u.; p < .001). Sixty-two limbs (n = 32 patients) exhibited improved foot perfusion after CT, with a mean variation of 80 ± 47 a.u., while 32 limbs (n = 23 patients) showed stable or worsened values. In a regression model, favorable variations in toflex-area after CT were linked to a worse baseline toflex-area (R2 = 0.18; p < 0.001; rpartial = –0.42) while the percentage improvement directly correlated with CEAP class (p = 0.033). Conclusions: The NIRS-assisted test, which is feasible in a laboratory context, objectively discriminates the hemodynamic tolerability of the treatment and identifies subjects with combined PAD and CVI with improved perfusion after CT, in spite of the presence of PAD.},

abstract = {Encoding, storage and retrieval constitute three fundamental stages in information processing and memory. They allow for the creation of new memory traces, the maintenance and the consolidation of these traces over time, and the access and recover of the stored information from short or long-term memory. Functional near- infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that measures concentration changes of oxygenated-hemoglobin (O2Hb) and deoxygenated-hemoglobin (HHb) in cortical microcirculation blood vessels by means of the characteristic absorption spectra of hemoglobin in the near-infrared range. In the present study, we monitored, using a 16-channel fNIRS system, the hemodynamic response during the encoding and retrieval processes (EP and RP, respectively) over the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of 13 healthy subjects (27.2 ± 2.6 years) while were performing the “Logical Memory Test” (LMT) of the Wechsler Memory Scale. A LMT-related PFC activation was expected; specifically, it was hypothesized a neural dissociation between EP and RP. The results showed a heterogeneous O2Hb/HHb response over the mapped area during the EP and the RP, with a O2Hb progressive and prominent increment in ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC) since the beginning of the EP. During the RP a broader activation, including the VLPFC, the dorsolateral PFC and the frontopolar cortex, was observed. This could be explained by the different contributions of the PFC regions in the EP and the RP. Considering the fNIRS applicability for the hemodynamic monitoring during the LMT performance, this study has demonstrated that fNIRS could be utilized as a valuable clinical diagnostic tool, and that it has the potential to be adopted in patients with cognitive disorders or slight working memory deficits.},

In this study, it was hypothesized that changes in local hemodynamic activity, due to the activation of Broca's area during overt/covert speech, can be harnessed to create an intuitive Brain Computer Interface based on Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). A 12-channel square template was used to cover inferior frontal gyrus and changes in hemoglobin concentration corresponding to six aloud (overtly) and six silently (covertly) spoken words were collected from eight healthy participants. An unsupervised feature extraction algorithm was implemented with an optimized support vector machine for classification. For all participants, when considering overt and covert classes regardless of words, classification accuracy of 92.88 ± 18.49% was achieved with oxy-hemoglobin (O2Hb) and 95.14 ± 5.39% with deoxy-hemoglobin (HHb) as a chromophore. For a six-active-class problem of overtly spoken words, 88.19 ± 7.12% accuracy was achieved for O2Hb and 78.82 ± 15.76% for HHb. Similarly, for a six-active-class classification of covertly spoken words, 79.17 ± 14.30% accuracy was achieved with O2Hb and 86.81 ± 9.90% with HHb as an absorber. These results indicate that a control paradigm based on covert speech can be reliably implemented into future Brain–Computer Interfaces (BCIs) based on NIRS.},

abstract = {Purpose: During exercise in supine posture or under microgravity in space, the gravity-dependent component of local blood pressure in leg muscles at upright posture can be simulated by lower body negative pressure (LBNP). We hypothesized that during resistive exercise LBNP favors oxygen availability in lower extremities, benefiting energy levels and performance of working muscles. Methods: In permutated crossover design, nine subjects performed a series of fifteen slow-paced concentric (4 s) and eccentric contractions (4 s) without or with 40 mmHg LBNP and 4 s pause between repetitions. The force at knee flexion was 6% of the one repetition maximum (1-RM) and gradually increased to 60% 1RM in the first half of the individual range of motion, subsequently remaining constant until full extension. Results: During the low force periods of continuous exercise, LBNP enhanced the refill of capillary blood measured by near infrared spectroscopy, amplifying the increase of total haemoglobin by about 20 µmol/l (p < 0.01) and oxyhaemoglobin by about 10 µmol/l (p < 0.01). During continuous exercise, LBNP induced a trend towards a lower EMG increment. This LBNP effect was not found when the periods of low forces at knee flexion were extended by 4 s pauses. Increased respiratory oxygen uptake (+ 0.1 l/min, p < 0.05) indicated overall enhanced muscle energy turn-over. Conclusions: Our results suggest stimulation of oxidative metabolism through LBNP enables working muscles to meet the energy demands of intense exercise. Further research is needed on the consequences for energy metabolism and the molecular control of growth and differentiation.},

abstract = {Purpose: To determine if prolonged sitting negatively impacts cognitive function, cerebral perfusion, and central cardiovascular hemodynamics; and secondly, to test whether weight or physical activity status alters this response. Methods: Participants (N=20, age=26±7; BMI=30±7 kg/m2; 7 female) were taken through 3 hrs of sitting followed by a 10-min walk (treadmill). Cognitive function was assessed during sitting (10, 60, 120, and 180 mins) and following the walk using a color/word Stroop test. Cerebral perfusion was measured via near infrared spectroscopy (total hemoglobin— tHb). Central cardiovascular hemodynamics and aortic stiffness (pulse wave velocity— PWV) were measured using the SphygmoCor XCEL device before, during and after sitting. Body mass index, %-bodyfat, and accelerometry data were used to characterize weight and physical activity status. Results: Following sitting, there was no change in Stroop completion time; however, both Color and Text times significantly decreased following the walk (e.g., Color Time: 10 mins sitting, 19±3 sec vs. Post walk, 16.7±3.6 sec, p<0.001). A similar finding was noted for change in reaction time (p=0.036). Cerebral perfusion did not change during sitting, but increased during the walk (180 mins sitting=415±38 $\mu$M vs. 10 min walk=432±42 $\mu$M; p<0.001). There was a significant increase in PWV for normal weight (Pre-sit=5.7±1 vs. Post-sit=6.1±1.1 m/s, p=0.009), but not in participants classified obese (p=0.02). Conclusion: These findings suggest that prolonged sitting does not alter cognitive function or cerebral perfusion, but sitting does increase aortic stiffness in normal weight individuals. Walking can improve cognitive function, an effect possibly related to increases in cerebral perfusion.},

abstract = {Purpose: To examine the reliability and the maturity-related differences of fatigue thresholds (FTs) among youth males. Methods: Twenty-nine youth males (11–17 y) completed 2 ramp exercise tests on a cycle ergometer. Systemic FTs were calculated from gas exchange and ventilation variables. Localized FTs were calculated from electromyography and near-infrared spectroscopy of the vastus lateralis. All FTs were determined using the maximal distance method and expressed relative to maximal oxygen consumption. All participants were grouped according to the number of years from peak height velocity into PRE- (< −1.5 y), PERI- (−1.5 to +1.5 y) and POST- (> +1.5 y) peak height velocity. Reliability was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficients, and differences between groups were assessed with analysis of variance and Cohen's d coefficients. Results: Analysis of variance revealed significant group differences with PRE having significantly greater systemic pulmonary FTs than POST, while localized muscular FTs were significantly greater in PRE when compared with PERI and POST. All FTs exhibited excellent reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient > .75) in all maturity groups. Conclusion: Maturity status appears to influence the onset of FTs among youth male athletes, with FTs occurring later in younger athletes. Furthermore, all FTs were reliable measures regardless of maturity.},

abstract = {Ischemic preconditioning (IP) has been shown to improve exercise performance and to delay fatigue. However, the precise mechanisms through which IP operates remain elusive. It has been hypothesized that IP lowers the sensation of fatigue by reducing the discharge of group III and IV nerve endings, which also regulate hemodynamics during the metaboreflex. We hypothesized that IP reduces the blood pressure response during the metaboreflex. Fourteen healthy males (age between 25 and 48 yr) participated in this study. They underwent the following randomly assigned protocol: postexercise muscle ischemia (PEMI) test, during which the metaboreflex was elicited after dynamic handgrip; control exercise recovery session (CER) test; and PEMI after IP (IP-PEMI) test. IP was obtained by occluding forearm circulation for three cycles of 5 min spaced by 5 min of reperfusion. Hemodynamics were evaluated by echocardiography and impedance cardiography. The main results were that after IP the mean arterial pressure response was reduced compared with the PEMI test (means ± SD +3.37 ± 6.41 vs. +9.16 ± 7.09 mmHg, respectively). This was the consequence of an impaired venous return that impaired the stroke volume during the IP-PEMI more than during the PEMI test (−1.43 ± 15.35 vs. +10.28 ± 10.479 ml, respectively). It was concluded that during the metaboreflex, IP affects hemodynamics mainly because it impairs the capacity to augment venous return and to recruit the cardiac preload reserve. It was hypothesized that this is the consequence of an increased nitric oxide production, which reduces the possibility to constrict venous capacity vessels.},

abstract = {Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) signals quantify the oxygenated ($\Delta$HbMbO 2 ) and deoxygenated ($\Delta$HHbMb) heme group concentrations. $\Delta$HHbMb has been preferred to $\Delta$HbMbO 2 in evaluating skeletal muscle oxygen extraction because it is assumed to be insensitive to blood volume (BV) changes, but uncertainties exist on this assumption. To analyze this assumption a computational model of oxygen transport and metabolism is used to quantify the effect of O 2 delivery and BV changes on the NIRS signals from a canine model of muscle oxidative metabolism (Med.Sci.SportsExerc.,48(10)2013-2020,2016). The computational analysis accounts for microvascular ($\Delta$HbO 2 , $\Delta$HHb) and extravascular ($\Delta$HMb, $\Delta$HMb) oxygenated and deoxygenated forms. Simulations predicted muscle oxygen uptake and NIRS signal changes well for blood flows ranging from resting to contracting muscle. Additional NIRS signal simulations were obtained in the absence or presence of BV changes corresponding to a heme groups concentration changes ($\Delta$HbMb=0-48$\mu$M). Under normal delivery (Q=1.0L kg -1 min -1 ) of contracting muscle, capillary oxygen saturation (SO 2 ) was 62% with capillary $\Delta$HbO 2 and $\Delta$HHb of ±41$\mu$M for $\Delta$HbMb=0. An increase of BV ($\Delta$HbMb =24mM) caused a $\Delta$HbO 2 decrease (16mM) almost twice as much as the increase observed for $\Delta$HHb (9$\mu$M). When SO 2 increased to more than 80%, only $\Delta$HbO 2 was significantly affected by BV changes. The analysis indicates that microvascular SO 2 is a key factor in determining the sensitivity of $\Delta$HbMbO 2 and $\Delta$HHbMb to BV changes. Contrary to a common assumption, the $\Delta$HHbMb is affected by BV changes in normal contracting muscle and even more in the presence of impaired O 2 delivery.},

The aim of this study was to assess the reproducibility of NIRS parameters during reactive hyperemia induced by a 5 min brachial artery occlusion. Twenty-four healthy young males (mean 34 ± 8 years old) had two microvascular function evaluations by NIRS over a 7 to 30-day period (mean 16 ± 10 days). Intra-subject and inter-observer reproducibility were evaluated with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), coefficient of variation (CV), and standard error of measurement (SEM%) for every parameter. Mean NIRS parameters did not differ between both evaluations. Reproducibility was greatest for muscle oxygen consumption (ICC: 0.84; CV: 6.51%; SEM: 7.11%), time to basal O(2)Hb (ICC: 0.63, CV: 20.04%, SEM 27.22%), time to maximal O(2)Hb (ICC: 0.71; CV: 15.61%; SEM: 19.27%), peak of O(2)Hb (ICC: 0.63, CV: 6.68%, SEM 8.53%), time to maximal tHb (ICC: 0.73, CV: 19,61%, SEM 24.56%) and area under the O(2)Hb and tHb curves (ICC: 0.68, CV: 16.15%, SEM 22.93% and ICC: 0.62, CV: 18.59%, SEM 26.64%, respectively). Moreover, inter-observer reproducibility ranged from excellent to perfect (ICC from 0.85 to 1.00) for every parameter. NIRS parameters during reactive hyperemia are highly reproducible which enables their repeated measurement to study microvascular function in healthy subjects.},

abstract = {Acute exercise-induced improvements in cognitive function are accompanied by increased (cerebral) blood flow and increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. Acute cocoa flavanol (CF) intake may improve cognitive function, cerebral blood flow (in humans), and BNDF levels (in animals). This study investigated (i) the effect of CF intake in combination with exercise on cognitive function and (ii) cerebral hemodynamics and BDNF in response to CF intake and exercise. Twelve healthy men participated in this randomized, double-blind, crossover study. Participants performed a cognitive task (CT) at 100 min after acute 903-mg CF or placebo (PL) intake, followed by a 30-min time-trial. Immediately after this exercise, the same CT was performed. Prefrontal near-infrared spectroscopy was applied during CT and exercise to measure changes in oxygenated ($\Delta$HbO2), deoxygenated ($\Delta$HHb), and total haemoglobin ($\Delta$Hbtot) and blood samples were drawn and analyzed for BDNF. Reaction time was faster postexercise, but was not influenced by CF. $\Delta$HbO2 during the resting CT was increased by CF, compared with PL. $\Delta$HbO2, $\Delta$HHb, and $\Delta$Hbtot increased in response to exercise without any effect of CF. During the postexercise cognitive task, there were no hemodynamic differences between CF or PL. Serum BDNF was increased by exercise, but was not influenced by CF. In conclusion, at rest, CF intake increased cerebral oxygenation, but not BDNF concentrations, and no impact on executive function was detected. This beneficial effect of CF on cerebral oxygenation at rest was overruled by the strong exercise-induced increases in cerebral perfusion and oxygenation.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to locate the breakpoints of cerebral and muscle oxygenation and muscle electrical activity during a ramp exercise in reference to the first and second ventilatory thresholds. Twenty-five cyclists completed a maximal ramp test on an electromagnetically braked cycle-ergometer with a rate of increment of 25 W/min. Expired gazes (breath-by-breath), prefrontal cortex and vastus lateralis (VL) oxygenation [Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)] together with electromyographic (EMG) Root Mean Square (RMS) activity for the VL, rectus femoris (RF), and biceps femoris (BF) muscles were continuously assessed. There was a non-linear increase in both cerebral deoxyhemoglobin (at 56 ± 13% of the exercise) and oxyhemoglobin (56 ± 8% of exercise) concomitantly to the first ventilatory threshold (57 ± 6% of exercise, p > 0.86, Cohen's d < 0.1). Cerebral deoxyhemoglobin further increased (87 ± 10% of exercise) while oxyhemoglobin reached a plateau/decreased (86 ± 8% of exercise) after the second ventilatory threshold (81 ± 6% of exercise, p < 0.05, d > 0.8). We identified one threshold only for muscle parameters with a non-linear decrease in muscle oxyhemoglobin (78 ± 9% of exercise), attenuation in muscle deoxyhemoglobin (80 ± 8% of exercise), and increase in EMG activity of VL (89 ± 5% of exercise), RF (82 ± 14% of exercise), and BF (85 ± 9% of exercise). The thresholds in BF and VL EMG activity occurred after the second ventilatory threshold (p < 0.05, d > 0.6). Our results suggest that the metabolic and ventilatory events characterizing this latter cardiopulmonary threshold may affect both cerebral and muscle oxygenation levels, and in turn, muscle recruitment responses. {\textcopyright} 2014 Racinais, Buchheit and Girard.},

@thesis{essay84927,
abstract = {Over the past decades, virtual reality (VR) technology has gained significant popularity and interest, both in research as well as on the consumer market. One promising application area of VR is virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET), which treats anxiety disorders by gradually exposing the patient to his/her fear using VR. To make VRET safe and effective, it is important to monitor the patient?s fear levels during the exposure. Non-invasive neuroimaging can be used to unobtrusively detect fear responses, among which functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) technology exhibits the greatest potential for a combination with VR, due to its comparably low susceptibility to motion artifacts. This thesis aims to investigate to what extent the fNIRS signals captured from people with a fear of heights response and people without a fear of heights response during VR exposure differ, and to what extent a person?s fear of heights response to a VR environment can be detected using fNIRS data. Only a very limited amount of work has investigated how fear responses are reflected in fNIRS signals. Furthermore, no previous work on the automatic detection of fear responses using fNIRS data exists. The literature indicates that a combination of VR and fNIRS technology is feasible and that it allows for experiments with greater ecological validity than traditional lab experiments. An experiment was conducted during which participants with moderate fear of heights (experimental group, n=15) and participants with no to little fear of heights (control group, n=14) were exposed to VR scenarios involving heights (height condition) and no heights (ground condition). During the experiment, the participants' fNIRS signals were recorded. As an additional measurement, the heart rate (HR) of every participant was extracted from the fNIRS signals. Permutation tests were used to perform between-group statistical analyses and within-group statistical analyses (for the experimental group) on the fNIRS data and HR data. Furthermore, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were used to train and test subject-dependent classifiers and subject-independent classifiers on the data of the significant fNIRS channels of the experimental group, in order to detect fear responses. The between-group statistical analyses show that the fNIRS data of the control group and the experimental group are only significantly different in channel 3, where the grand average ?[HbO] contrast signal of the experimental group exceeds that of the control group. Furthermore, the HR data of both groups are not significantly different. The within-group statistical analyses show that there are significant differences between the grand average ?[HbO] values during fear responses and those during no-fear responses, where the ?[HbO] values of the fear responses were significantly higher than those of the no-fear responses in the channels located towards the frontal part of the pre-frontal cortex. Also, channel 23 was found to be significant for the grand average ?[HbR] signals. No significant differences were found between the HR data during fear responses or no fear responses of the experimental group. The subject-dependent SVM classifier using 1-second history of the fNIRS signals can detect fear responses at an average accuracy of 72.47% (SD 20.61). The subject-independent SVM classifier using 5-second history of the fNIRS signals can detect fear responses at an average accuracy of 77.29% (SD 10.64). The subject-independent classifiers show potential for usage in online detection scenarios, as they can be trained beforehand on existing fNIRS data and can classify the unseen data of a new person at an average accuracy above 75%.},

abstract = {Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive method to monitor cerebral haemodynamics. Used either alone or in combination with other non-invasive methods such as transcranial Doppler sonography, this technique is well suited for use in cerebrovascular research in ageing. Reproducibility of NIRS, however, has only been determined in neonates and adults. We applied controlled desaturation (the O2-method) to measure the cerebral blood volume (CBV) with NIRS in 16 healthy subjects aged 65 to 88. This method uses deoxygenated haemoglobin (the concentration of which is manipulated by desaturation) as an intravascular tracer for NIRS. We determined repeatability (between tests interval: 2 min), short-term reproducibility (intervals of 20 and 40 min) and long-term reproducibility (interval > 2 weeks). We found a coefficient of variation (CV) of 12.5% for repeatability and a CV of 11.7% for short-term reproducibility. The CV for long-term reproducibility was 15%. We conclude that NIRS can reproducibly measure CBV in subjects aged 65 and older, using the O2-method. In this group of healthy subjects, this method was well tolerated. {\textcopyright} 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Purpose: To characterize the relationships between muscle oxygenation and performance during on- and off-water tests in highly trained sprint canoe–kayak athletes. Methods: A total of 30 athletes (19 kayakers and 11 canoeists) performed a maximal incremental test on a canoe or kayak ergometer for determination of VO2max and examination of the relation between peak power output (PPO) and physiological parameters. A subset of 21 athletes also performed a 200- and a 500- (for women) or 1000-m (for men) on-water time trial (TT). Near-infrared spectroscopy monitors were placed on the latissimus dorsi, biceps brachii, and vastus lateralis during all tests to assess changes in muscle O2 saturation (SmO2) and deoxyhemoglobin concentration ([HHb]). The minimum O2 oxygenation (SmO2min) and maximal O2 ($\Delta$[HHb] extraction) were calculated for all subjects. Results: PPO was most strongly correlated with VO2max (R = .9), but there was also a large correlation between PPO and both SmO2min and $\Delta$[HHb] in latissimus dorsi (R = −.5, R = .6) and vastus lateralis (R = −.6, R = .6, all P < .05). Multiple regression showed that 90% of the variance in 200-m performance was explained by both $\Delta$[HHb] and SmO2min in the 3 muscles combined (P < .01) and 71% of the variance in 500-/1000-m performance was explained by $\Delta$[HHb] in the 3 muscles (P < .01). This suggests that O2 extraction is a better predictor of performance than VO2max in sprint canoe–kayak. Conclusions: These results highlight the importance of peripheral adaptations in both short and long events and stress the relevance of adding muscle oxygenation measurements during testing and racing in sprint canoe–kayak.},

abstract = {Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the acute responses to repeated-sprint exercise (RSE) in hypoxia induced by voluntary hypoventilation at low lung volume (VHL). Methods: Nine well-trained subjects performed two sets of eight 6-s sprints on a cycle ergometer followed by 24 s of inactive recovery. RSE was randomly carried out either with normal breathing (RSN) or with VHL (RSH-VHL). Peak (PPO) and mean power output (MPO) of each sprint were measured. Arterial oxygen saturation, heart rate (HR), gas exchange and muscle concentrations of oxy-([O2Hb]) and deoxyhaemoglobin/myoglobin ([HHb]) were continuously recorded throughout exercise. Blood lactate concentration ([La]) was measured at the end of the first (S1) and second set (S2). Results: There was no difference in PPO and MPO between conditions in all sprints. Arterial oxygen saturation (87.7 ± 3.6 vs 96.9 ± 1.8% at the last sprint) and HR were lower in RSH-VHL than in RSN during most part of exercise. The changes in [O2Hb] and [HHb] were greater in RSH-VHL at S2. Oxygen uptake was significantly higher in RSH-VHL than in RSN during the recovery periods following sprints at S2 (3.02 ± 0.4 vs 2.67 ± 0.5 L min−1 on average) whereas [La] was lower in RSH-VHL at the end of exercise (10.3 ± 2.9 vs 13.8 ± 3.5 mmol.L−1; p < 0.01). Conclusions: This study shows that performing RSE with VHL led to larger arterial and muscle deoxygenation than with normal breathing while maintaining similar power output. This kind of exercise may be worth using for performing repeated sprint training in hypoxia.},

abstract = {Muscle ischemia and reperfusion induced by ischemic preconditioning (IPC) can improve performance in various activities. However, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of IPC on muscle hemodynamics and oxygen (O2) uptake during repeated maximal contractions. In a cross-over, randomized, single-blind study, 10 strength-trained men performed 5 sets of 5 maximal voluntary knee extensions of the right leg on an isokinetic dynamometer, preceded by either IPC of the right lower limb (3×5-min compression/5-min reperfusion cycles at 200 mm Hg) or sham (20 mm Hg). Changes in deoxyhemoglobin, expressed as a percentage of arterial occlusion, and total hemoglobin ([THb]) concentrations of the vastus lateralis muscle were monitored continuously by near-infrared spectroscopy. Differences between IPC and sham were analyzed using Cohen's effect size (ES) ± 90% confidence limits, and magnitude-based inferences. Compared with sham, IPC likely increased muscle blood volume at rest (↑[THb], 46.5%; ES, 0.56; 90% confidence limits for ES, -0.21, 1.32). During exercise, peak force was almost certainly higher (11.8%; ES, 0.37; 0.27, 0.47), average force was very likely higher (12.6%; ES, 0.47; 0.29, 0.66), and average muscle O2 uptake was possibly increased (15.8%; ES, 0.36; -0.07, 0.79) after IPC. In the recovery periods between contractions, IPC also increased blood volume after sets 1 (23.6%; ES, 0.30; -0.05, 0.65) and 5 (25.1%; ES, 0.32; 0.09, 0.55). Three cycles of IPC immediately increased muscle perfusion and O2 uptake, conducive to higher repeated force capacity in strength-trained athletes. This maneuver therefore appears relevant to enhancing exercise training stimulus.},

abstract = {Near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is an established non-invasive optical technique for measuring changes in haemoglobin concentration occurring in the microcirculation in real time. NIR spectroscopy parameters refect change in tissue haemodynamics and oxygenation and can contribute important physiologic insights when used alone or interpreted in parallel with other conventional measurements. The broad use of NIR spectroscopy in research is not matched by clinical applications; reasons include limitations inherent to the technique, using instruments designed for research at the bedside, ambiguity regarding what NIR spectroscopy measures, defciencies of early algorithms, and understandable expectations by clinicians that NIR spectroscopy data are reproducible and specific enough for clinical decision making. Such issues could be addressed by appropriate collaboration where clinicians drive the questions which NIR spectroscopy is to answer, researchers contribute to monitoring methodology, device design and data analysis/algorithms and both groups utilise physiologic knowledge and practical lessons learned from prior NIR spectroscopy studies when interpreting data. NIR spectroscopy applications in urology are recent and offer clear opportunities for clinicians and researchers to collaborate. Urology is a field where current clinical investigations are limited in terms of the physiologic information they provide and because the principal test used for evaluation of the many people who have problematic lower urinary tract dysfunction is invasive in nature. Hence the rationale for non-invasive transcutaneous optical monitoring of the bladder during voiding as, when the organ contracts, changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin occur which allow haemodynamic variations and alterations in oxygen supply and demand to be inferred. Different patterns of change are evident in healthy and diseased tissue; these patterns refect the effects of physiologic events observed using NIR spectroscopy to study other tissues and provide novel insights into the causation of voiding dysfunction. This review of the evolution of a wireless methodology for bladder studies includes examples of effective clinician researcher collaboration, reveals how miniature NIR spectroscopy devices make monitoring in ambulant subjects straightforward and makes possible studies in special populations such as children and patients with spinal cord injury. Hence, such wireless devices represent an advance of relevance in urology and an opportunity to expand research in other fields and progress with translation of NIR spectroscopy into other relevant clinical arenas. {\textcopyright} IM Publications LLP 2012.},

H-BR was designed to simulate planetary habitats. Pulmonary O2 uptake (V? O2) and vastus lateralis fractional O2 extraction (changes in deoxygenated hemoglobinmyoglobin concentration, [deoxy(HbMb)] evaluated using near-infrared spectroscopy) were evaluated in normoxia and during an incremental cycle ergometer (CE) and one-leg knee extension (KE) exercise (aimed at reducing cardiovascular constraints to oxidative function). Mitochondrial respiration was evaluated ex vivo by high-resolution respirometry in permeabilized vastus lateralis fibers. During CE V ? O2peak and [deoxy(HbMb)]peak were lower (P-0.05) after both N-BR and H-BR than during CTRL; during KE the variables were lower after N-BR but not after H-BR. During CE the overshoot of [deoxy(HbMb)] during constant work rate exercise was greater in N-BR and H-BR than CTRL, whereas during KE a significant difference vs. CTRL was observed only after N-BR. Maximal mitochondrial respiration determined ex vivo was not affected by either intervention. In N-BR, a significant impairment of oxidative metabolism occurred downstream of central cardiovascular O2 delivery and upstream of mitochondrial function, possibly at the level of the intramuscular matching between O2 supply and utilization and peripheral O2 diffusion. Superposition of hypoxia on bed rest did not aggravate, and partially reversed, the impairment of muscle oxidative function in vivo induced by bed rest. The effects of longer exposures will have to be determined.},

Blood flow on-kinetics were significantly speeded during the second bout (time constant = 7.7 ± 2.6 vs. 14.8 ± 5.8 s), and O2 extraction was greater at the onset of contractions (0.050 ± 0.030 vs. 0.020 ± 0.010 ml 02/ml blood). Kinetics of muscle deoxygenation were significantly slower at the onset of the second bout (7.2 ± 2.2 vs. 4.4 ± 1.2 s), while relative oxyhemoglobin concentration was elevated throughout the second bout. These results suggest that better matching of O2 delivery to V̇o2 speeds V̇o2 on-kinetics at this metabolic rate, but do not eliminate a potential role for enhanced metabolic activation. Additionally, altered motor unit recruitment at the onset of a second bout is not a prerequisite for reductions in the V̇o2 slow-component amplitude after a priming contractile bout in canine muscle in situ.

abstract = {Sustained attention is the ability to keep focused and vigilance for long time in external stimulation, which was crucial in safe-critical human-machine system. While the ability of sustained attention will decline because of mental fatigue, even lead to serious accidents in fatigue state. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore the impact of fatigue on sustained attention. Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) can measure cerebral hemoglobin in order to reflect cognitive function indirectly. In previous related fatigue studies, monotonous and long-time CPT (continuous performance test task) was often used to explore the performance change and brain activity, but the effect of time on task (TOT) was always involved. In this study, in order to avoid the TOT effect, the sustained attention task and fatigue task were separated. It was adopted in the study that the modified continuous performance test (CPT) was chosen as the sustained attention task and verbal 2-back task as the fatigue induced task. The fNIRS signals were extracted from 10 channels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) from 20 healthy subjects. Studies found that cerebral lateralization increased significantly from alert to fatigue state in sustained attention task. Besides, Average oxyhemoglobin (HBO) of PFC increased significantly from alert to fatigue task, and the spatial pattern of activity of oxyhemoglobin also changed, which c be sensitive features to fatigue detection. {\textcopyright} 2017 SPIE.},

abstract = {Background: The use of herbal extracts and supplements to enhance health and wellbeing is increasing in western society. Aims: This study investigated the impact of the acute ingestion of a commercially available water containing an extract and hydrolat of rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L. syn. Salvia rosmarinus Schleid.). Aspects of cognitive functioning, mood and cerebrovascular response measured by near-infrared spectroscopy provided the dependent variables. Methods: Eighty healthy adults were randomly allocated to consume either 250 mL of rosemary water or plain mineral water. They then completed a series of computerised cognitive tasks, followed by subjective measures of alertness and fatigue. Near-infrared spectroscopy monitored levels of total, oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin at baseline and throughout the cognitive testing procedure. Results: Analysis of the data revealed a number of statistically significant, small, beneficial effects of rosemary water on cognition, consistent with those found previously for the inhalation of the aroma of rosemary essential oil. Of particular interest here are the cerebrovascular effects noted for deoxygenated haemoglobin levels during cognitive task performance that were significantly higher in the rosemary water condition. This represents a novel finding in this area, and may indicate a facilitation of oxygen extraction at times of cognitive demand. Conclusion: Taken together the data suggest potential beneficial properties of acute consumption of rosemary water. The findings are discussed in terms of putative metabolic and cholinergic mechanisms.},

abstract = {Background: Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience followed by anxiety, depression, and frustration. Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) as an optical technique identifies the brain functional networks by investigating connectivity between functionally linked of different anatomical regions in response to pain stimulation. Methods: In this research, fNIRS was performed in order to study the difference in effective functional connectivity of the brain prefrontal cortex between the two modes of pain and rest based on the dynamic causal modeling (DCM) method. Effective functional connectivity changes in the prefrontal cortex between pain and rest states were calculated using DCM approach to investigate (1) areas known for pain sensation and (2) to analyze inter-network functional connectivity strength (FCS) by selecting several brain functional networks based on the analysis findings. All analyses were performed using toolboxes SPM-fNIRS and SPM8, Matlab software. Results: Regional hemodynamics changes caused deoxyhemoglobin concentration to decrease in the prefrontal cortex of both hemispheres, particularly on the right side. We found a simultaneous increase in the concentration of oxyhemoglobin in the prefrontal cortex of the left hemisphere in comparison to the right hemisphere, that there was a trend toward reduction in oxyhemoglobin concentration. The results indicate that during the cold pain stimulation, the connectivities between prefrontal cortex regions were significantly changed. Specifically, a significantly consistent increase in the RPFC to MPFC connectivity was found while a significant consistent decrease was observed in the both MPFC to LPFC and LPFC to MPFC connectivities. Conclusion: This study contributes to the pain research field to identify the directionality and causality of neuronal connections in the prefrontal cortex by applying DCM to fNIRS data. The results suggest that the proposed method infers directional interactions between hidden neuronal states in the brain under neuronal dynamic conditions based on optical density changes measurement.},

abstract = {VO2 fluctuations are argued to be an important mechanism underpinning chronic adaptations following interval training. We compared the effect of exercise modality, continuous vs. intermittent realized at a same intensity, on electrical muscular activity, muscular oxygenation and on whole body oxygen uptake. Twelve participants (24 ± 5 years; VO2peak: 43 ± 6 mL{\textperiodcentered} min−1{\textperiodcentered}kg−1) performed (i) an incremental test to exhaustion to determine peak work rate (WRpeak); two randomized isocaloric exercises at 70%WRpeak; (ii) 1 bout of 30 min; (iii) 30 bouts of 1 min work intercepted with 1 min passive recovery. For electromyography, only the CON exercise showed change for the vastus lateralis root-mean-square (+6.4 ± 5.1%, P <.01, 95%CI 3.2, 8.3) and mean power frequency (−5.2 ± 4.8, P <.01, 95%CI −8.2, −3.5). Metabolic fluctuations (i.e. Oxygen Fluctuation Index and HHb Fluctuation Index) were higher in the intermittent modality, while post-exercise blood lactate concentrations (4.80 ± 1.50 vs. 2.32 ± 1.21 mM, respectively, for the CON and INT, P <.01, 95%CI 1.72, 3.12) and the time spent over 90% of VO2 target (1644 ± 152 vs. 356 ± 301 sec, respectively, for the CON and INT, P <.01, 95%CI 1130, 1446) were higher in the continuous modality. In conclusion, despite a similar energy expenditure and intensity, intermittent and continuous exercises showed two very different physiological responses. The intermittent modality would lead to a larger recruitment of fast twitch fibres that are less mitochondria-equipped and therefore may be more likely respondent to mitochondrial adaptations. In addition, this modality induces greater metabolic variations, a stimulus who could lead to mitochondrial development.},

abstract = {Telerobotic operation, i.e., a human operator to manipulate remote robotic systems at a distance, has started to gain its popularity in the construction industry. It is expected to help tackle operational challenges in dynamic construction workplaces. The success of telerobotic operation builds on the effective design of the human-robot interface to provide human operators with necessary senses about the remote workplaces, involving multimodal sensory cues, such as visual, audio and haptic feedback. Especially the force feedback design in telerobotic control interface is of central interest and is becoming the main feature of the bilateral control system for tel- eoperation, as it helps provide feedback about heavy physical interactions and processes in typical construction operations. Nonetheless, how force feedback simulation solutions affect the human operator's perceptional and behavioral reactions is less understood. This paper investigates the neurobehavioral performance of operators with a bilateral control system in a typical industrial valve operation experiment (n = 21). The experiment tested two force feedback conditions: Realistic (the system replicates the exact same feeling of the torque in valve manipulation operations) and Mediated (the simulation reduces the force on the human operator end by 50% to enable more flexible controls). The performance of the participants was evaluated via various metrics, including task performance, human performance and operational velocity uniformity. Data was collected with eye- tracking, neuroimaging (functional near-infrared spectroscopy, fNIRS), motion analysis, and NASA TLX sur- veys. The results indicated that the mediated force feedback in bilateral telerobotic operation helped more ac- curate operation, increased dual tasking, reduced cognitive load and more efficient neural functions; yet it encouraged participants to engage in more irregular actions, showing as dramatic changes in valve rotating speeds. The findings suggest that the force feedback design of telerobotic systems should be more carefully thought through to balance the advantages and disadvantages.},

abstract = {Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can increase cortical excitability of a targeted brain area, which may affect endurance exercise performance. However, optimal electrode placement for tDCS remains unclear. We tested the effect of two different tDCS electrode montages for improving exercise performance. Nine subjects underwent a control (CON), placebo (SHAM) and two different tDCS montage sessions in a randomized design. In one tDCS session, the anodal electrode was placed over the left motor cortex and the cathodal on contralateral forehead (HEAD), while for the other montage the anodal electrode was placed over the left motor cortex and cathodal electrode above the shoulder (SHOULDER). tDCS was delivered for 10 min at 2.0 mA, after which participants performed an isometric time to exhaustion (TTE) test of the right knee extensors. Peripheral and central neuromuscular parameters were assessed at baseline, after tDCS application and after TTE. Heart rate (HR), ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), and leg muscle exercise-induced muscle pain (PAIN) were monitored during the TTE. TTE was longer and RPE lower in the SHOULDER condition (P < 0.05). Central and peripheral parameters, and HR and PAIN did not present any differences between conditions after tDCS stimulation (P > 0.05). In all conditions maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) significantly decreased after the TTE (P < 0.05) while motor-evoked potential area (MEP) increased after TTE (P < 0.05). These findings demonstrate that SHOULDER montage is more effective than HEAD montage to improve endurance performance, likely through avoiding the negative effects of the cathode on excitability.},

abstract = {Background: This study examined the effects of different levels of compression (0, 20 and 40 mmHg) produced by leg garments on selected psycho-physiological measures of performance while exposed to passive vibration (60 Hz, amplitude 4-6 mm) and performing 3-min of alpine skiing tuck position. Methods: Prior to, during and following the experiment the electromygraphic (EMG) activity of different muscles, cardio-respiratory data, changes in total hemoglobin, tissue oxygenation and oscillatory movement of m. vastus lateralis, blood lactate and perceptual data of 12 highly trained alpine skiers were recorded. Maximal isometric knee extension and flexion strength, balance, and jumping performance were assessed before and after the experiment. Results: The knee angle (-10°) and oscillatory movement (-20-25.5%) were lower with compression (P < 0.05 in all cases). The EMG activities of the tibialis anterior (20.2-28.9%), gastrocnemius medialis (4.9-15.1%), rectus femoris (9.6-23.5%), and vastus medialis (13.1-13.7%) muscles were all elevated by compression (P < 0.05 in all cases). Total hemoglobin was maintained during the 3-min period of simulated skiing with 20 or 40 mmHg compression, but the tissue saturation index was lower (P < 0.05) than with no compression. No differences in respiratory parameters, heart rate or blood lactate concentration were observed with or maximal isometric knee extension and flexion strength, balance, and jumping performance following simulated skiing for 3 min in the downhill tuck position were the same as in the absence of compression. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that with leg compression, alpine skiers could maintain a deeper tuck position with less perceived exertion and greater deoxygenation of the vastus lateralis muscle, with no differences in whole-body oxygen consumption or blood lactate concentration. These changes occurred without compromising maximal leg strength, jumping performance or balance. Accordingly, our results indicate that the use of lower leg compression in the range of 20-40 mmHg may improve alpine skiing performance by allowing a deeper tuck position and lowering perceived exertion.},

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects between tablet computer-based productive and receptive cognitive engagement using an alternating-treatment design. Three healthy older adults performed a total of 19 sessions consisting of three baseline periods and 16 alternating training sessions. The training sessions were divided into four blocks and each block involved four treatment sessions. Productive and receptive engagements were randomly allocated to four treatment sessions. All participants alternatively received productive engagement that requires learning new practical applications and receptive engagement requiring little new learning such as listening to music. Prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity using functional near-infrared spectroscopy and executive function through the Trail Making Test were assessed at the baseline and the end of each session. All data were visually analyzed. Visual analysis results showed that the productive engagement was associated with higher PFC activity and faster performance in the Trail Making Test, compared to those utilizing receptive engagement. These results suggest that productive engagement might be effective in facilitating PFC activity and improving the executive function of healthy older adults, indicating cognitively challenging activities are more beneficial relative to nonchallenging activities.</p>},

abstract = {We investigated the impact of ramp and constant-load exercise on (i) respiratory muscle fatigue and locomotor muscle oxygenation, (ii) their relationship with the excess VO2 and VO2 slow component (SC). Fourteen male cyclists performed two tests to exhaustion: an incremental ramp and a constant-load exercise with continuous monitoring of expired gases and oxygenation of the vastus lateralis muscle on two separate days. Maximal inspiratory (MIP) and expiratory (MEP) pressure measurements were taken at rest and post- exercise. The VO2 excess represents the difference between VO2max observed and VO2max expected using linear equation between the VO2 and the intensity before gas-exchange threshold. During the ramp exercise, MIP and MEP declined by 13 ± 8 and 19 ± 10%, respectively (p < 0.05). MIP and MEP were not correlated to the excess VO2 (0.09 ± 0.05 l min−1). During the constant-load exercise, the VO2 SC (0.70 ± 0.22 l min−1) was correlated (r = 0.68, p < 0.01) to deoxyhemoglobin SC (2.94 ± 1.25 A U) but not to the excess VO2 (r = 0.30, p = 0.2).

Our results show that respiratory muscle fatigue was correlated to the VO2 SC in the constant-load exercise, whereas it was not correlated to the excess VO2 in ramp exercise may be because of our small excess VO2.},

abstract = {The study aim was to compare the predictive validity of the often referenced traditional model of human endurance performance (i.e. oxygen consumption, VO2, or power at maximal effort, fatigue threshold values, and indices of exercise efficiency) versus measures of skeletal muscle oxidative potential in relation to endurance cycling performance. We hypothesized that skeletal muscle oxidative potential would more completely explain endurance performance than the traditional model, which has never been collectively verified with cycling. Accordingly, we obtained nine measures of VO2 or power at maximal efforts, 20 measures reflective of various fatigue threshold values, 14 indices of cycling efficiency, and near-infrared spectroscopy-derived measures reflecting in vivo skeletal muscle oxidative potential. Forward regression modeling identified variable combinations that best explained 25-km time trial time-to-completion (TTC) across a group of trained male participants (n = 24). The time constant for skeletal muscle oxygen consumption recovery, a validated measure of maximal skeletal muscle respiration, explained 92.7% of TTC variance by itself (Adj R2 =.927, F = 294.2, SEE = 71.2, p <.001). Alternatively, the best complete traditional model of performance, including VO2max (L{\textperiodcentered}min−1), %VO2max determined by the ventilatory equivalents method, and cycling economy at 50 W, only explained 76.2% of TTC variance (Adj R2 =.762, F = 25.6, SEE = 128.7, p <.001). These results confirm our hypothesis by demonstrating that maximal rates of skeletal muscle respiration more completely explain cycling endurance performance than even the best combination of traditional variables long postulated to predict human endurance performance.},

abstract = {Background: Cognitive processes are required during walking to appropriately respond to environmental and task demands. There are now many studies that have used functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) to record brain activation to investigate neural bases of cognitive contributions in gait. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the published research regarding Prefrontal cortical (PFC) activation patterns during simple and complex walking tasks in young adults, older adults and clinical groups with balance disorders using fNIRS. Our secondary aim was to evaluate each included study based on methodological reporting criteria important for good data quality. Methods: We conducted searches in June 2018 using four databases: Embase, PubMed, Scopus and PsycINFO. The strategy search used was: (((((near infrared spectroscopy) OR functional near infrared spectroscopy) OR nirs) OR fnirs) AND (((gait) OR walking) OR locomotion) AND (((((young) OR adult) OR older) OR elderly) NOT children)) AND (((Brain) OR cortex) OR cortical) for our search. The papers included met the specific review criteria: (i) used fNIRS to measure PFC activation patterns; (ii) included walking tasks (simple and complex) and; (iii) assessed young people, older people and/or clinical groups with balance disorders. Results: Thirty five (describing 75 brain activation comparisons) of the 308 studies retrieved through our search met the inclusion criteria. Based on 6 methodological reporting considerations, 20 were of high quality, 10 were of medium quality and 5 were of low quality. Eleven/20 comparisons in young people, 23/37 comparisons in older people and 15/18 comparisons in clinical groups reported increased PFC activation with increased walking task complexity. The majority of comparisons that used verbal fluency, counting backwards or secondary motor tasks reported increases in PFC activation (83%, 64% and 58% of these studies, respectively). In contrast, no studies found secondary visual tasks increased PFC activation. Conclusion: Increased PFC activation was most common in studies that involved walks comprising secondary verbal fluency and arithmetic tasks. Clinical groups generally showed increased PFC activation irrespective of type of secondary task performed during walking which suggests these groups require more attentional resources for safe walking.

abstract = {Verbal repetition is a fundamental language capacity where listening and speaking are inextricably coupled with each other. We have recently reported that the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) harbors articulation-based codes, as evidenced by activation during repetition of meaningless speech sounds, i.e., pseudowords. In this study, we aimed at confirming this finding and further investigating the possibility that sound perception as well as articulation is subserved by neural circuits in this region. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we monitored changes of hemoglobin (Hb) concentration at IFG bilaterally, while subjects verbally repeated pseudowords and words. The results revealed that the proportion of oxygenated hemoglobin (O<inf>2</inf>Hb) over total Hb was significantly higher at the left IFG during repetition of pseudowords than that of words, replicating the observation by functional MRI and indicating that the region processes articulatory codes for verbal repetition. More importantly for this study, hemodynamic modulations were observed at both IFG during passive listening without repetition to various sounds, including natural environmental sounds, animal vocalizations, and human non-speech sounds. Furthermore, the O<inf>2</inf>Hb concentration increased at the left IFG but decreased at the right IFG for both speech and non-speech sounds. These findings suggest that both speech and non-speech sounds may be processed and maintained by a neural mechanism for sensorimotor integration using articulatory codes at the left IFG. {\textcopyright} 2013 Yoo and Lee.},

abstract = {The study examined whether the aerobic fitness level modifies the cerebral oxygenation response to incremental ramp exercise, and more specifically the decline in cerebral oxygenation from heavy exercise up to maximal intensities. 11 untrained (V˙O2max 47.3±4.0mLmin-1kg-1) and 13 endurance-trained (V˙O2max 61.2±8.0mLmin-1kg-1) healthy men performed a maximal ramp cycle exercise. Left prefrontal cortex oxygenation ($\delta$HbO2) was monitored by near-infrared spectroscopy. A cerebral oxygenation threshold decline (ThCOx) during exercise was determined. ThCox occurred in all subjects but for higher V˙O2 (mLmin-1kg-1) in endurance-trained than in untrained subjects (P<0.01). At submaximal exercise intensity corresponding to ThCOx, $\delta$HbO2 was higher in endurance-trained than in untrained subjects (P<0.05). V˙O2 at ThCox was related to V˙O2 at respiratory compensation point (n=24, r=0.93, P<0.001) and to V˙O2max (n=24, r=0.92, P<0.001). These findings indicate that above the respiratory compensation point the prefrontal O2 demand exceeds the supply in untrained and in endurance-trained subjects. In addition, the occurrence of ThCOx was delayed to higher absolute exercise intensities in endurance-trained in relation with their higher V˙O2max than untrained men. These results demonstrated that aerobic fitness influences cerebral oxygenation during exercise.},

abstract = {During heavy exercise, hyperventilation-induced hypocapnia leads to cerebral vasoconstriction, resulting in a reduction in cerebral blood flow (CBF). A reduction in CBF would impair cerebral O2 delivery and potentially account for reduced exercise performance in hypoxia. We tested the hypothesis that end-tidal Pco2 (PETCO2) clamping in hypoxic exercise would prevent the hypocapnia-induced reduction in CBF during heavy exercise, thus improving exercise performance. We measured PETCO2, middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAv; index of CBF), prefrontal cerebral cortex oxygenation (cerebral O2Hb; index of cerebral oxygenation), cerebral O2 delivery (DO2), and leg muscle oxygenation (muscle O2Hb) in 10 healthy men (age 27 ± 7 years; VO2max 63.3 ± 6.6 mL/kg/min; mean ± SD) during simulated 15-km time trial cycling (TT) in normoxia and hypoxia (FIO2 = 0.10) with and without CO2 clamping. During exercise, hypoxia elevated MCAv and lowered cerebral O2Hb, cerebral DO2, and muscle O2Hb (P < 0.001). CO2 clamping elevated PETCO2 and MCAv during exercise in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions (P < 0.001 and P = 0.024), but had no effect on either cerebral and muscle O2Hb (P = 0.118 and P = 0.124). Nevertheless, CO2 clamping elevated cerebral DO2 during TT in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions (P < 0.001). CO2 clamping restored cerebral DO2 to normoxic values during TT in hypoxia and tended to have a greater effect on TT performance in hypoxia compared to normoxia (P = 0.097). However, post hoc analysis revealed no effect of CO2 clamping on TT performance either in normoxia (P = 0.588) or in hypoxia (P = 0.108). Our findings confirm that the hyperventilation-induced hypocapnia and the subsequent drop in cerebral oxygenation are unlikely to be the cause of the reduced endurance exercise performance in hypoxia.},

abstract = {Objective: This study assessed whether a multi-ingredient herbal supplement containing Bacopa monniera (BM), Panax quinquefolius ginseng (PQ) and whole coffee fruit extract (WCFE) could enhance cognitive performance and cerebral-cortical activation during tasks of working memory and attention. Method: In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, between-group study, 40 healthy adults between 18–60 years (M = 34.46 SD = 12.95) completed tasks of working memory and attention at baseline and 45 min post active or placebo supplement consumption. During the cognitive testing, changes in hemodynamic response in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) were continuously measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Results: Working memory task performance on the N-back task was significantly improved following active supplement consumption compared to placebo in terms of accuracy (p <.01) and response time (p <.05). Improved performance was associated with a reduction of PFC activation (p <.001) related to effortful mental demand, reflecting increased neural efficiency concomitant with improved cognitive performance. The effects were independent of background demographics variables and changes in blood glucose response and mood. Discussion: This is the first report of acute effects on cognitive performance in healthy adults following intake of a combined, multi-ingredient herbal supplement with concomitant changes in cerebral haemodynamic response. The potential synergistic effects of polyphenolic compounds on neurocognitive function and fNIRS use in nutritional intervention studies, poses a significant increase in the capacity to understand the effects of dietary compounds on the brain.},

abstract = {The present study examined to what extent professional boxing compromises cerebral haemodynamic function and its association with CTBI (chronic traumatic brain injury). A total of 12 male professional boxers were compared with 12 age-, gender- and physical fitness-matched non-boxing controls. We assessed dCA (dynamic cerebral autoregulation; thigh-cuff technique and transfer function analysis), CVRCO2 (cerebrovascular reactivity to changes in CO2: 5% CO2 and controlled hyperventilation), orthostatic tolerance (supine to standing) and neurocognitivefunction (psychometric tests). Blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (transcranial Doppler ultrasound),mean arterial blood pressure (finger photoplethysmography), end-tidal CO2 (capnography) and corticaloxyhaemoglobin concentration (near-IR spectroscopy) were continuously measured. Boxers were characterized byfronto-temporal neurocognitive dysfunction and impaired dCA as indicated by a lower rate of regulation andautoregulatory index (P<0.05 compared with controls). Likewise, CVRCO2 was also reduced resulting in a lowerCVRCO2 range (P<0.05 compared with controls). The latter was most marked in boxers with the highest CTBIscores and correlated against the volume and intensity of sparring during training (r= -0.84, P<0.05). Theseimpairments coincided with more marked orthostatic hypotension, cerebral hypoperfusion and corresponding cortical de-oxygenation during orthostatic stress (P<0.05 compared with controls). In conclusion, these findings provide the first comprehensive evidence for chronically impaired cerebral haemodynamic function in active boxersdue to the mechanical trauma incurred by repetitive, sub-concussive head impact incurred during sparring training. This may help explain why CTBI is a progressive disease that manifests beyond the active boxing career. {\textcopyright} The Authors Journal compilation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Biochemical Society.},

We evaluated this method using multimodal data acquired from human right finger tapping tasks. And we found the proposed method is able to clearly identify from the linked components of fMRI and fNIRS where and when the hemodynamic signals are changing. In particular, the estimated associations between fNIRS and fMRI will be displayed as time varying spatial fMRI maps along with the fNIRS time courses. In addition, the joint components between fMRI and fNIRS are combined together to generate full spatiotemporal "snapshots" and movies, which provides an excellent way to examine the dynamic interplay between hemodynamic fNIRS and fMRI measurements. {\textcopyright} 2013 Yuan and Ye.},

abstract = {Spinal cord-injured (SCI) individuals, having a sympathetic nervous system lesion, experience hypotension during sitting and standing. Surprisingly, they experience few syncopal events. This suggests adaptations in cerebrovascular regulation. Therefore, changes in systemic circulation, cerebral blood flow, and oxygenation in eight SCI individuals were compared with eight able-bodied (AB) individuals. Systemic circulation was manipulated by lower body negative pressure at several levels down to -60 mmHg. At each level, we measured steady-state blood pressure, changes in cerebral blood velocity with transcranial Doppler, and cerebral oxygenation using near-infrared spectroscopy. We found that mean arterial pressure decreased significantly in SCI but not in AB individuals, in accordance with the sympathetic impairment in the SCI group. Cerebral blood flow velocity decreased during orthostatic stress in both groups, but this decrease was significantly greater in SCI individuals. Cerebral oxygenation decreased in both groups, with a tendency to a greater decrease in SCI individuals. Thus present data do not support an advantageous mechanism during orthostatic stress in the cerebrovascular regulation of SCI individuals.},

Forty-five PAD and 15 healthy participants were studied at entry and at 34 ± 2 weeks. Healthy participants performed their usual activities. Patients with PAD performed 2 home-based programs: structured at prescribed pace (S-pre, n = 31) and unstructured at free pace (U-free, n = 14). We measured ankle-brachial index (ABI), NIRS calf oxygen consumption at rest, NIRS dynamic muscle perfusion during an incremental test, and walking capacity. In all patients with PAD the NIRS parameters significantly increased approaching the stable values of untrained healthy participants. Among PAD, only S-pre group showed significant improvements in hemodynamic, functional, and NIRS parameters with selective adaptations in the worse legs. The assessment of NIRS parameters, that were found stable without training in healthy and modified in PAD only following structured training, might outline the local exercise-induced adaptations. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s).},

Eleven moderately trained male runners completed familiarization and three randomized, crossover 5-km running time trials on a non-motorized treadmill in hot conditions (33 °C). The trials included ice slurry ingestion before exercise (ICE), menthol mouth rinse during exercise (MEN), and no intervention (CON). Running performance was significantly improved with MEN (25.3 ± 3.5 min; P = 0.01), but not ICE (26.3 ± 3.2 min; P = 0.45) when compared with CON (26.0 ± 3.4 min). Rectal temperature was significantly decreased with ICE (by 0.3 ± 0.2 °C; P < 0.01), which persisted for 2 km of the run and MEN significantly decreased perceived thermal sensation (between 4 and 5 km) and ventilation (between 1 and 2 km) during the time trial. End-exercise blood prolactin concentration was elevated with MEN compared with CON (by 25.1 ± 24.4 ng/mL; P = 0.02). The data demonstrate that a change in the perception of thermal sensation during exercise from menthol mouth rinse was associated with improved endurance running performance in the heat.

abstract = {Background: One of the most important conditions where there is loss of normal bladder function is spinal cord injury (SCI). Currently, evaluation of bladder function is limited to periodic invasive urodynamic testing (UDS). The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and usefulness of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in monitoring bladder function in patients with SCI during bladder filling and emptying and to investigate the correlations of NIRS measures with simultaneous UDS parameters. NIRS is a non-invasive optical method to study tissue oxygenation, hemodynamics and function by monitoring changes in the chromophore concentrations of oxygenated (O 2Hb), deoxygenated (HHb) and total hemoglobin (tHb). Methods: 10 adult paraplegic patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction who were referred for regular urodynamic evaluation were recruited. Changes in O 2Hb, HHb and tHb, and tissue saturation index (TSI%) in the detrusor were monitored and recorded by a wireless NIRS system during the urodynamic evaluation. Time points of urgency and urinary leakage were marked and patterns of change in NIRS parameters were compared to standard urodynamic pressure tracings. Results: Strong consistency between changes in NIRS-derived tHb and changes in intravesical pressure were observed during filling across the subjects. During bladder filling a gradual increase in O 2Hb and tHb with minimal changes in HHb was observed. Interestingly, a drop in TSI% was detected seconds before strong urgency and urinary leakage. Conclusions: Our preliminary data suggest a relationship between noninvasive NIRS measures and UDS parameters during bladder filling in SCI patients. {\textcopyright} 2012 SPIE.},

abstract = {Interrogation of tissue with light offers the potential for noninvasive chemical measurement, and penetration with near-infrared wavelengths (750-1000 nm) is greater than with visible light. Specific absorption by clinically relevant compounds such as oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin and the intracellular respiratory enzyme cytochrome oxidase enable in vivo measurement of these to be performed safely and conveniently. This is the basis of in vivo near-infrared spectroscopy (ivNIRS). Multiple scattering of the interrogating beam by tissues leads to an optical path that is considerably longer than the simple physical pathlength and this complicates the analysis. Modeling of photon propagation through tissues with, for example, finite element and Monte Carlo methods, is assisting in improving the ivNIRS methodology. Instrumentation has advanced from simple continuous wave approaches, through time-resolved methods based on either time-domain or frequency-domain approaches, to spatially resolved measurement based on diffuse reflectance. Initial clinical applications were for monitoring the brain in the neonate and fetus and muscle in adults. Currently, use in adults and children for neurological assessments are of growing interest.},

abstract = {Aim: This study investigated cerebral hemodynamic responses to a neurovascular coupling (NVC) test in retired contact athletes with a history of repeated mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and in controls with no history of mTBI. Methods: Twenty-one retired rugby players (47.7 ± 12.9 year old; age at retirement: 38.5 ± 8.9 year; number of years playing rugby: 12.7 ± 3.7 year) with a history of three or more diagnosed concussions (8.9 ± 7.9 concussions per player) and 23 controls with no history of mTBI (46.5 ± 12.8 year old) performed a NVC test to detect task-orientated cerebral hemodynamic changes using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Results: The NVC showed a statistically significant reduction in the cerebral hemodynamic response in comparison to the control group which had a greater relative increase of oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb). There were reductions in left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) O2Hb (−0.015 ± 0.258 $\mu$M) and relative increases in deoxyhemoglobin (HHb; −0.004 ± 0.159 $\mu$M) in the same region for the mTBI group in comparison to the control group (−0.160 ± 0.311 $\mu$M; −0.121 ± 0.076 $\mu$M for O2Hb and HHb, respectively). The mTBI group induced a greater rate of oxygen extraction compared to the control group. Conclusion: This was the first study to examine cerebral hemodynamic changes in retired rugby players in response to a NVC test, and we found reduced cerebral hemodynamic responses in participants with a history of mTBI compared to controls. These results suggest altered cerebral metabolic demands in participants with a history of multiple head injuries. Further research is needed to ascertain an understanding of the changes in hemodynamics from playing into retirement.},

Design: Prospective single-arm pre–post pilot study. Setting: Human Performance Research Laboratory. Participants: Adult men with traumatic chronic cervical SCI (n = 6; age = 30.8 ± 12.5). Intervention: Twenty-four sessions of structured OLT. Outcome measures: Walking endurance was determined during a constant work-rate time-to-exhaustion treadmill test. Normalized perceived fatigability was calculated by dividing subjective ratings of tiredness by walking time. Cardiorespiratory outcomes and muscle oxygen extraction were analyzed using breath-by-breath gas-exchange and near-infrared spectroscopy. Results: OLT resulted in large effects on walking endurance (1232 ± 446 s vs 1645 ± 255 s; d = 1.1; P = 0.045) and normalized perceived fatigability (5.3 ± 1.5 a.u. vs 3.6 ± 0.9 a.u.; d = 1.3; P = 0.033).

abstract = {Background: Among patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), gait is typically disturbed and less automatic. These gait changes are associated with impaired rhythmicity and increased prefrontal activation, presumably in an attempt to compensate for reduced automaticity. Research question: We investigated whether during treadmill walking, when the pace is determined and fixed, prefrontal activation in patients with PD is lower, as compared to over-ground walking. Methods: Twenty patients with PD (age: 69.8 ± 6.5 yrs.; MoCA: 26.9 ± 2.4; disease duration: 7.9 ± 4.2 yrs) walked at a self-selected walking speed over-ground and on a treadmill. A wireless functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) system measured prefrontal lobe activation, i.e., oxygenated hemoglobin (Hb02) in the pre-frontal area. Gait was evaluated using 3D-accelerometers attached to the lower back and ankles (Opal™ APDM). Dynamic gait stability was assessed using the maximum Lyapunov exponent to investigate automaticity of the walking pattern. Results: Hb02 was lower during treadmill walking than during over-ground walking (p = 0.001). Gait stability was greater on the treadmill, compared to over-ground walking, in both the anteroposterior and medio-lateral axes (p < 0.001). Significance: These findings support the notion that when gait is externally paced, prefrontal lobe activation is reduced in patients with PD, perhaps reflecting a reduced need for compensatory cognitive mechanisms.},

abstract = {New Findings: What is the central question in this study? It is unknown to what extent increasing age influences the dynamic adaptations of cerebral blood flow velocity and cortical oxygenation in response to changes in blood pressure (cerebral autoregulation) and to changes in carbon dioxide (cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity). What is the main finding and its importance? We have shown that ageing up to 86 years is associated with an overall preservation of dynamic cerebral autoregulation and cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity, leading to a sufficiency of cerebral cortical oxygenation during daily life activities, despite the decrease in absolute cerebral blood flow velocity and increase in cerebrovascular resistance with advancing age. With ageing, cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) decreases; however, to what extent dynamic cerebral autoregulation and cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity are influenced by ageing is unknown. The aim was to examine the dynamic responses of CBFV and cortical oxygenation to changes in blood pressure (BP) and arterial CO2 across different ages. Fifty-eight participants in three age groups were included, as follows: young (n = 20, 24 ± 2 years old), elderly (n = 20, 66 ± 1 years old), and older elderly (n = 18, 78 ± 3 years old). The CBFV was measured using transcranial Doppler ultrasound, simultaneously with oxyhaemoglobin (O2Hb) using near-infrared spectroscopy and beat-to-beat BP measurements using Finapres. Postural manoeuvres were performed to induce haemodynamic fluctuations. Cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity was tested with hyperventilation and CO2 inhalation. With age, CBFV decreased (young 59 ± 12 cm s-1, elderly 48 ± 7 cm s-1 and older elderly 42 ± 9 cm s-1, P < 0.05) and cerebrovascular resistance increased (1.46 ± 0.58, 1.81 ± 0.36 and 1.98 ± 0.52 mmHg cm-1 s-1, respectively, P < 0.05). Normalized gain (autoregulatory damping) increased with age for BP-CBFV (0.88 ± 0.18, 1.31 ± 0.30 and 1.06 ± 0.34, respectively, P < 0.05) and CBFV-O2Hb (0.10 ± 0.09, 0.12 ± 0.04 and 0.17 ± 0.08, respectively, P < 0.05) during the repeated sit-stand manoeuvre at 0.05 Hz. Even though the absolute changes in CBFV and cerebrovascular resistance index during the cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity were higher in the young group, the percentage changes in CBFV, cerebrovascular resistance index and O2Hb were similar in all age groups. In conclusion, there was no decline in dynamic cerebral autoregulation and cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity with increasing age up to 86 years. Despite the decrease in cerebral blood flow velocity and increase in cerebrovascular resistance with advancing age, CBFV and cortical oxygenation were not compromised in these elderly humans during manoeuvres that mimic daily life activities. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Physiological Society.},

abstract = {Exposure of biological tissue to photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) seems to increase the oxygen availability and mitochondrial electrochemical activity. With the advancement of new technologies, such as near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), information can be obtained about the balance between oxygen utilization and delivery by assessing local oxy- ([O2Hb]) and deoxy-myohemoglobin ([HHb]) concentrations, both measured in micromolars ($\mu$M). Consequently, NIRS can be used to study (“in vivo”) PBMT effects on the oxidative system, including oxygen availability. Thus, the main objective of the present study was to use NIRS to investigate the acute effects of PBMT by light-emitting diode (LED) on the oxygen delivery and utilization in humans. Twelve healthy young participants were treated with a LED device (850 nm, 50 mW, 2 J) and placebo applied over the proximal third of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle of the left or right forearm selected in a random order. The LED was applied in direct contact with skin and the device was switched on for 40 s in 4 different interventions (I1, I2, I3 and I4) with a 3-min interval between interventions. The placebo condition was considered as the period before the first PBMT. The NIRS device was used to evaluate the relative changes in [O2Hb] and [HHb] before and after placebo and interventions. We found that PBMT statistically increased the [O2Hb] in 0.39 $\mu$M. These results demonstrate the potential of PBMT to increase oxygen availability.},

abstract = {Objectives: The postural control dual-task literature has demonstrated greater postural stability during dual-task in comparison to single task (i.e., standing balance alone through the examination of multiple kinetic and kinematic measures. This improve stability is thought to reflect an automatic mode of postural control during dual-task. Recently, sample entropy (SampEn) and wavelet discrete transform have supported the claim of automaticity, as higher SampEn values and a shift toward increased contributions from automatic sensory systems have been demonstrated in dual-task settings. In order to understand the cortical component of postural control, functional near-infrared spectroscopy has been used to measure cortical activation during postural control conditions. However, the neural correlates of automatic postural behaviour have yet to be fully investigated. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to confirm the presence of automatic postural control through static and dynamic balance measures, and to investigate the prefrontal cortex activation when concurrently performing quiet standing and the auditory cognitive tasks of varied difficulty. Method: Eighteen healthy young adults (21.4 ± 3.96 yo), 12 females and 6 males, with no balance deficits were recruited. Participants were instructed to either quietly stand on a force platform (SM), perform three cognitive tasks while seated (SC) or perform both aforementioned tasks concurrently (DT). Results: Results supported automatic postural control with lower area and standard deviation of center-of-pressure in DT conditions compared to SM. As for SampEn and the wavelet analysis, DT conditions demonstrated greater values than SM, and a shift from vision to a cerebellar contribution. For the most difficult cognitive task, the DNS task, a trend toward significantly lower right hemisphere prefrontal cortex activation compared to left hemisphere activation in DT was found, potentially representing a decrease in cognitive control, and the presence of automaticity. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the simultaneous performance of a difficult cognitive task and posture yields automatic postural behaviour, and provides insight into the neural correlates of automaticity.},

Twenty-nine participants were randomly allocated to three groups, which included: 1) five-days of repeated leg occlusion (4 x 5-min) IPC at limb occlusive pressure, plus fixed-intensity (55% V˙ O2max) cycling HA at $\sim$36 °C/40% humidity; 2) HA plus sham IPC (20 mmHg) or 3) or CON (thermoneutral 55% V˙ O2max plus sham IPC). In IPC + HA and HA, there were increases in maximal oxygen consumption (O2max) (7.8% and 5.4%, respectively; P < 0.05), ventilatory threshold (VT) (5.6% and 2.4%, respectively, P < 0.05), delta efficiency (DE) (2.0% and 1.4%, respectively; P < 0.05) and maximum oxygen pulse (O2pulse-Max) (7.0% and 6.9%, respectively; P < 0.05) during an exhaustive incremental test. There were no changes for CON (P > 0.05). Changes (P < 0.05) in resting core temperature (TC), muscle oxygen consumption (m V˙ O2), and limb blood flow (LBF) were also found pre-to-post intervention among the HA and IPC + HA groups, but not in CON (P > 0.05). Five-days of either HA or IPC + HA can enhance markers of endurance performance in cooler environments, alongside improved muscle oxygen extraction, blood flow, exercising muscle efficiency and O2 pulse at higher intensities, thus suggesting the occurrence of peripheral adaptation. Both HA and IPC + HA enhance the adaptation of endurance capacity, which might partly relate to peripheral changes.},

abstract = {Background: The aging process alters upright posture and locomotion control from an automatically processed to a more cortically controlled one. The present study investigated a postural-cognitive dual-task paradigm in young and older adults using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Methods: Twenty healthy participants (10 older adults 72 ± 3 y, 10 young adults 23 ± 3 y) performed a cognitive (serial subtractions) and a postural task (tandem stance) as single-tasks (ST) and concurrently as a dual-task (DT) while the oxygenation levels of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) were measured. Results: In the cognitive task, young adults performed better than older adults in both conditions (ST and DT) and could further increase the number of correct answers from ST to DT (all ps ≤ 0.027) while no change was found for older adults. No significant effects were found for the postural performance. Cerebral oxygenation values (O2Hb) increased significantly from baseline to the postural ST (p = 0.033), and from baseline to the DT (p = 0.031) whereas no changes were found in deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb). Finally, the perceived exertion differed between all conditions (p ≤ 0.003) except for the postural ST and the DT (p = 0.204). Conclusions: There was a general lack of age-related changes except the better cognitive performance under motor-cognitive conditions in young compared to older adults. However, the current results point out that DLPFC is influenced more strongly by postural than cognitive load. Future studies should assess the different modalities of cognitive as well as postural load.},

Methods: Exercise-hypoxia tolerance was tested using a constant treadmill exercise of 5.5 km{\textperiodcentered}h<sup>-1</sup>at 3.8% grade (mimicking exertion at altitude) with 3-min steps of progressive normobaric poikilocapnic hypoxia. Breath-by-breath ventilatory responses, Spo<inf>2</inf>, and cerebral (frontal cortex) and active muscle (vastus lateralis) oxygenation were measured throughout. Acute hypoxic ventilatory response (AHVR) was determined by linear regression slope of ventilation vs. Spo<inf>2</inf>. PRE and POST (<15 days) expedition, tHb-mass was measured using carbon monoxide-rebreathing. Results: Post-expedition, exercise-hypoxia tolerance improved (11:32±3:57 to 16:30±2:09 min, p<0.01). AHVR was elevated (1.25±0.33 to 1.63±0.38 L{\textperiodcentered}min<sup>-1.</sup>%<sup>-1</sup>Spo<inf>2</inf>, p<0.05). Spo<inf>2</inf>decreased throughout exercise-hypoxia in both trials, but was preserved at higher values at 4800 m post-expedition. Cerebral oxygenation decreased progressively with increasing exercise-hypoxia in both trials, with a lower level of deoxyhemoglobin POST at 2400, 3500 and 4800 m. Muscle oxygenation also decreased throughout exercise-hypoxia, with similar patterns PRE and POST. No relationship was observed between the slope of AHVR and cerebral or muscle oxygenation either PRE or POST. Absolute tHb-mass response exhibited great individual variation with a nonsignificant 5.4% increasing trend post-expedition (975±154 g PRE and 1025±124 g POST, p=0.17). Conclusions: We conclude that adaptation to chronic hypoxia during a climbing expedition to Mt. Everest will increase hypoxic tolerance, AHVR, and cerebral but not muscle oxygenation, as measured during simulated acute hypoxia at sea level. However, tHb-mass did not increase significantly and improvement in cerebral oxygenation was not associated with the change in AHVR.},

abstract = {Brain near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is an emerging neurophysiological tool that combines straightforward activity localization with cost-economy, portability and patient compatibility. NIRS is proving its empirical utility across specific cognitive and emotional paradigms. However, a potential limitation is that it is not only sensitive to haemodynamic changes taking place in the cortex, and task-related cardiovascular responses expressed in the perfusion of extracranial layers may be confounding. Existing literature reports correlations between brain NIRS and systemic blood pressure, yet it falls short of establishing whether in normal participants the blood pressure changes encountered in experimental settings can have confounding effects. Here, we tested this hypothesis by performing two experimental manipulations while recording from superficial occipital cortex, encompassing striate and extrastriate regions. Visual stimulation with reversing chequerboards evoked cortical haemodynamic responses. Simultaneously and independently, transient systemic blood pressure changes were generated through rapid arm-raising. Shallow-penetration NIRS recordings, probing only extra-cerebral tissues, highlighted close haemodynamic coupling with blood pressure. A different coupling pattern was observed in deep-penetration recordings directed at haemodynamic signals from visual cortex. In absence of blood-pressure changes, NIRS signals tracked differences in visual stimulus duration. However when blood pressure was actively manipulated, this effect was absent and replaced by a very large pressure-related response. Our observations demonstrate that blood pressure fluctuations can exert confounding effects on brain NIRS, through expression in extracranial tissues and within the brain itself. We highlight the necessity for continuous blood pressure monitoring alongside brain NIRS, and for further research on methods to correct for physiological confounds. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is sensitive to the acute and chronic effects of physical activity (PA), while the anxiolytic effects of PA are well known. The current study examined the association of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), and its interaction with PA, with resting-state left PFC oxygenation. This cross-sectional study used data from participants (n=2444) from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, a nationally representative prospective study of community-living adults aged ≥50 years in Ireland. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview Short-Form determined fulfilment of criteria for GAD. The short-form International Physical Activity Questionnaire determined adherence to the World Health Organisation PA guidelines. Resting-state, left PFC oxygenation was continuously measured via a Portalite. Tissue saturation index (TSI) was calculated as the ratio of oxygenated haemoglobin to total tissue haemoglobin (expressed as a percentage) for the final minute of a five-minute supine-rest period. Multivariable lineae regression quantified associations of GAD with TSI in the total population and population stratified by PA status. Participants with GAD had lower TSI (b=-1.416, p=0.008) compared to those without GAD. However, this association was modified by PA. Among participants who met the PA guidelines, TSI did not differ according to GAD status (b=-0.800, p=0.398). For participants who did not meet the guidelines TSI was significantly lower among those with GAD (b=-1.758, p=0.004). These findings suggest that PA may help to protect brain health among older adults with GAD.},

(2) Assess the effects of three WBV frequencies on all outcome measures. Methods: Eleven males with SCI and 10 AB individuals were recruited. Subjects completed three WBV exercise sessions at 30, 40 and 50Hz. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and relative changes in oxygenated ($\Delta$[HbMbO2]), deoxygenated ($\Delta$[HHbMb]) and total ($\Delta$[HbMbtot]) heme groups were obtained when steady state was achieved for: pre-WBV sitting, pre-WBV standing, WBV and post-WBV standing. Results: Both groups demonstrated small but significant increases in , $\Delta$[HbMbO2] and $\Delta$[HbMbtot]; but the increases were larger in the SCI group. A significant decrease $\Delta$[HHbMb] was observed in the SCI group. No frequency effect was observed. Conclusion: The WBV responses do not appear sufficient to induce cardiovascular benefits in the SCI population. WBV may be helpful for individuals with SCI in improving lower limb peripheral blood flow and coping with orthostatic hypotension symptoms earlier in their rehabilitation programs.Implications for RehabilitationIncreased muscle oxygenation and blood flow observations in response to WBV suggest a possible application of WBV for increasing lower extremity blood flow and/or oxygen saturation in individuals with SCI.WBV may be incorporated into the rehabilitation programs for reducing thrombosis susceptibility in individuals with SCI.Blood pressure in individuals with SCI appeared to be maintained much better in the upright position when WBV is applied.This could be helpful in the rehabilitation of SCI patients by allowing them to avoid the difficulties of orthostatic hypotension earlier in their rehabilitation programs. {\textcopyright} 2014 Informa UK Ltd.},

This study assessed the effect of an acute bout of continuous (CONT) or intermittent (INT), moderate-intensity treadmill exercise on executive function in young children. Twenty healthy children, mean (SD); age: 8.8 (0.8) years; height: 140 (9) cm; weight: 36 (11) kg; boys: n = 9, performed a graded-exercise test to determine maximal oxygen uptake, and two 15-min submaximal bouts of treadmill exercise; protocols were either CONT or INT. During CONT, participants ran at 90% of gas exchange threshold. During INT, participants performed six consecutive 2.5 min blocks of exercise, which were designed to reflect children's typical activity patterns, comprising 45 s at a heavy intensity, 33 s at a moderate intensity, 10 s at a severe intensity, and 62 s at a low intensity. Participants performed the Stroop task before the submaximal exercise bouts and after, at 1-, 15-, and 30-min intervals. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measured cerebral perfusion and oxygenation. Regardless of condition, Stroop performance was improved at 1 min after compared to before, 54.9 (9.8) s versus 57.9 (11) s, respectively, p < .01, and improvements were maintained until 30 min after. NIRS (oxyhemoglobin, total hemoglobin) explained a significant amount of variance in the change in Stroop performance for INT only (49%, p < .05). An acute bout of exercise, of either an intermittent or continuous nature, improves executive function in children, and effects are maintained for ≤ 30 min following exercise cessation. Accordingly, it is recommended that children should engage in physical activity during periods of school recess.},

abstract = {Excessive  adiposity  is  associated  with  altered  oxygen  tension  and  comorbidities  in  humans.  In  contrast,  marine  mammals  have  high  adiposity  with  no  apparent  detrimental effects. However, partial pressure of oxygen (Po2) in their subcutaneous adipose  tissue  (blubber)  and  its  relationship  with  fatness  have  not  been  reported.  We  measured Po2 and temperature at different blubber depths in 12 healthy juvenile grey seals. Fatness was estimated from blubber thickness and morphometric parameters. Simultaneously, we monitored breathing pattern; heart rate and arterial blood saturation  with  a  pulse  oximeter;  and  relative  changes  in  total  hemoglobin,  deoxyhemoglobin,  and  oxyhemoglobin  in  blubber  capillaries  using  near-  infrared  spectroscopy  (NIRS) as proxies for local oxygenation changes. Blubber Po2 ranged from 14.5 to 71.4 mmHg (39.2 ± 14.1 mmHg), which is similar to values reported in other species. Blubber Po2 was strongly and negatively associated with fatness (LME: p < 0.0001, R2marginal  =  0.53,  R2conditional  =  0.64,  n  =  10),  but  not  with  blubber  depth.  No  other  parameters  explained  variability  in  Po2,  suggesting  arterial  blood  and  local  oxygen  delivery did not vary within and between measurements. The fall in blubber Po2 with increased fatness in seals is consistent with other animal models of rapid fat deposition. However, the Po2 levels at which blubber becomes hypoxic and consequences of low blubber Po2 for its health and function, particularly in very fat individuals, remain unknown. How seals avoid detrimental effects of low oxygen tension in adipose tis-sue, despite their high and fluctuating adiposity, is a fruitful avenue to explore.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare the acute effects of different types (treadmill vs. cycle) of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on cerebral blood flow and cognitive function in young adults. METHODS: By a randomized crossover study design, ten participants were initially assigned to either treadmill exercise (TE; n=5) or cycle ergometer exercise (CE; n=5) and then they performed the other with seven-day wash-out period. Both exercises were implemented at the target heart rate corresponding to 70% of heart rate reserve for 30 minutes. Cognitive function was assessed by the Stroop Color-Word test at pre-and post-exercise. Cerebral blood flow was continuously monitored using near-infrared spectroscopy technique during rest, cognitive function test (CFT), and exercise. RESULTS: There was a significant group by time interaction in tissue saturation index (TSI) (p=.046). Post-hoc analysis presented that TSI at post-exercise CFT was higher than during exercise in TE (p=.02). In both exercises, TSI at pre-exercise CFT significantly increased compared to the resting value (p=.001). Cerebral oxyhemoglobin level was significantly increased during exercise and at post-exercise CFT compared to the resting value in both exercises (p<.001). The reaction time for certain cognitive tasks such as color, word with matched color, word with color interference, and color with word interference was improved after both exercises (p<.05). CONCLUSIONS: One-bout of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise acutely improves cerebral blood flow and cognitive function even in healthy young adults. Exercise types with the same intensity do not seem to make meaningful difference in the positive effects of aerobic exercise.},

abstract = {During exercise in hypoxia, O2 delivery to brain and muscle is compromised, and oxidative stress is elicited. Cocoa flavanols (CF) have antioxidant capacities and can increase blood flow by stimulating endothelial function. We aimed to examine the effects of 7-day CF intake on oxidative stress, nitric oxide production, and tissue oxygenation in response to exercise in normobaric hypoxia (14.3% O2). In a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study, 14 well-trained male cyclists completed four trials: exercise in normoxia or hypoxia, after 7-day CF or placebo intake. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was measured before intake of the last dose CF or placebo. One hundred minutes later, 20-min steady-state (SS; 45% V O2max) and 20-min time trial (TT) (cycling) were performed. Blood samples were taken. Prefrontal and muscular oxygenation was assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy. At baseline, FMD was increased by CF. Hypoxia increased exercise-induced elevations in lipid peroxidation and antioxidant capacity. CF suppressed exercise-induced lipid peroxidation but did not influence antioxidant capacity. At rest and during SS, prefrontal and muscular oxygenation was decreased by hypoxia. CF elevated prefrontal oxygenation but did not impact muscular oxygenation. During TT, hypoxia accelerated the exercise-induced decrease in prefrontal oxygenation, but not in muscular oxygenation. During TT, CF did not alter prefrontal and muscular oxygenation. CF did not change plasma nitrite, nitrate, and arginine:citrulline. During high-intensity exercise, CF improved neither tissue oxygenation nor performance in well-trained athletes. At rest and during moderate-intensity exercise, CF reduced exercise-induced lipid peroxidation and partially restored the hypoxia-induced decline in prefrontal oxygenation. NEW & NOTEWORTHY For the first time, we showed that CF had beneficial effects on endothelial function at rest, as well as on prefrontal oxygenation at rest and during moderate-intensity exercise, both in normoxia and hypoxia. Moreover, we showed that CF intake inhibited oxidative stress during exhaustive exercise in hypoxia.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Authors. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) muscle oxygenation data are relied on in sports medicine. Many women with urinary incontinence (UI) have dysfunctional pelvic floor muscles (PFMs) but their evaluation lacks such measures; a transvaginal NIRS interface would enable the PFM to be interrogated. Paired miniature fiber-optic cables were configured on a rigid foam insert so their emitter detector arrays with an interoptode distance of 20 mm apposed the right and left inner sides of a disposable clear plastic vaginal speculum, and linked to a standard commercial NIRS instrument. Measurement capability was assessed through conduct of three maximum voluntary contractions (MVCs) and one sustained maximum voluntary contraction of the PFM with calculation of HbDiff (RT), a validated muscle reoxygenation kinetic parameter. In all four asymptomatic controls, mean age 40, mean BMI 21.4, MVCs were associated with changes in PFM oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb), deoxyhemoglobin (HHb) concentration, and their difference (HbDiff) comparable to those in voluntary muscle sports medicine studies. NIRS data during recovery (reoxygenation) allowed calculation of HbDiff (RT). New techniques are called for to evaluate UI. This NIRS interface warrants further development as the provision of quantitative reoxygenation kinetics offers more comprehensive evaluation of patients with PFM dysfunction.},

Seventy adults with different CV status (27 controls, 18 metabolic syndrome (MetS) and 25 coronary heart disease (CHD) patients) underwent a 5-min forearm arterial occlusion in supine position. High-resolution ultrasound examination of the brachial artery was performed during 1 minute at rest and 45 to 120 seconds after cuff release. Oxy, de-oxy and total hemoglobin signals (O2Hb, HHb and tHb) were measured continuously with NIRS on brachio-radialis muscle. FMD was reduced in CHD patients (P < 0.05) compared to controls. Max. amplitude of O2Hb and Hmax of tHb were reduced (P < 0.05) in MetS patients vs. controls. Post-deflation area under the curve (A.U.C) of O2Hb was lower in CHD (P < 0.01) patients vs. controls and MetS patients. Independent predictors of microvascular function (A.U.C of O2Hb) were abdominal obesity and LDL-cholesterol whereas macrovascular function (FMD) was predicted by CV status. Only A.U.C of O2Hb related to CV risk numbers whereas FMD was not. Although macro and microvascular function were impaired in MetS and CHD patients, microvascular function was more strongly related to CV risk factors.},

Results: ALS patients had slower time constants for phosphocreatine (PCr) and muscle oxygen consumption (mVO<inf>2</inf>) compared with young, but not age-matched controls. The coefficient of variation for the time constant was 10% (SD=2.8%) and 17% (SD=6.2%) for PCr and mVO<inf>2</inf>, respectively.

abstract = {Objective: To compare tilt-induced alterations in cardiovascular homeostasis and cerebral oxygenation of spinal cord-injured (SCI) to able-bodied (AB) individuals. Design: Subjects underwent 10 min supine rest followed by 10 min 70°head-up tilt. The last 5 min of supine rest and head-up tilt were analyzed, provided a steady state existed. Subjects: SCI individuals (n = 11), with lesions between C4 and T4, and AB individuals (n = 10), all males and balanced for age and weight. Main outcome measures: Calf circumference, mean arterial pressure (MAP), stroke volume, heart rate and cerebral oxygenated ([O2Hb]), deoxygenated ([HHb]) and total ([tHb]) haemoglobin concentration changes were measured. Results: Head-up tilt evoked a greater fall in MAP (mean (SD): -9 (12) vs 2 (6) mmHg P = 0.02) and stroke volume(-43 (12) vs -22 (10)%, P = 0.005), and a greater increase in heart rate (27 (12) vs 18 (6) beats, P = 0.04) in SCI than AB. Cardiac output decreased during head-up tilt in SCT but not in AB (-17 (15) vs 1 (15)%, P = 0.01). The change in cerebral oxygenation ([HHb]: 3.9 (2.8) rs 2.8 (1.4) $\mu$mol{\textperiodcentered}1-1, P = 0.1 and [O2Hb]: -6.1 (5.0) vs -2.1 (5.5) $\mu$mol{\textperiodcentered}l-1, P = 0.1) was similar in SCI and AB. All variables mentioned showed a change significantly different from zero in both groups, apart from [O2Hb] in AB and [tHb] in both groups. Conclusion: SCI demonstrated a greater decrease of MAP and stroke volume with a similar decrease in cerebral oxygenation compared to AB. This suggests that although systemic circulation was less well regulated in SCI compared with AB, cerebral circulation in SCI was maintained as in AB.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that the potential for training to alter the physiological responses to exercise in children is related to a "maturational threshold". To address this, we investigated the interaction of swimtraining status and maturity on cardiovascular and metabolic responses to lower and upper body exercise. Twenty-one prepubertal [Pre: 11 trained (T), 10 untrained (UT)], 30 pubertal (Pub: 14 T, 16 UT), and 18 postpubertal (Post: 8 T, 10 UT) girls completed ramp incremental exercise on a cycle and an upper body ergometer. In addition to pulmonary gas exchange measurements, stroke volume and cardiac output were estimated by thoracic bioelectrical impedance, and muscle oxygenation status was assessed using near-infrared spectroscopy. All T girls had a higher peak O2 uptake during cycle (Pre: T 49 ± 5 vs. UT 40 ± 4; Pub: T 46 ± 5 vs. UT 36 ± 4; Post: T 48 ± 5 vs. UT 39 ± 8 ml{\textperiodcentered}kg-1{\textperiodcentered}min-1; all P < 0.05) and upper body exercise (Pre: T 37 ± 6 vs. UT 32 ± 5; Pub: T 36 ± 5 vs. UT 28 ± 5; Post: T 39 ± 3 vs. UT 28 ± 7ml{\textperiodcentered}kg-1{\textperiodcentered}min-1; allP < 0.05). T girls also had a higher peak cardiac output during both modalities, and this reached significance in Pub (cycle: T 21 ± 3 vs. UT 18 ± 3; upper body: T 20 ± 4 vs. UT 15 ± 4 l/min; all P < 0.05) and Post girls (cycle: T 21 ± 4 vs. UT 17 ± 2; upper body: T 22 ± 3 vs. UT 18 ± 2 l/min; all P < 0.05). None of the measured pulmonary, cardiovascular, or metabolic parameters interacted with maturity, and the magnitude of the difference between T and UT girls was similar, irrespective of maturity stage.

abstract = {Local oxygen consumption in a muscle (V̇O2) can be determined by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). In principle it should be possible to use this measure to validate musculoskeletal models. However, the relationship between V̇O2 and external force, or between V̇O2 and surface EMG, as a measure for muscle activity, is hardly known. The aim of this study was: (1) to evaluate the characteristics of the relationship between V̇O2 and external moments and (2) to determine whether differences exist between the EMG-moment relationship and the V̇O2-moment relationship. Subjects (n=5) were asked to perform isometric contractions exerting combinations of elbow flexion and pro/supination moments at force levels up to 70% of their maximum. Simultaneous surface-EMG and NIRS measurements were performed on the m. biceps breve (BB) and the m. brachioradialis (BR). A linear relationship was found between EMG and V̇O2. For the BB V̇O2 and EMG were linearly related to both the flexion moment and the pro/supination moment. However, for the BR only a linear relationship with flexion moment was found. As expected, based on the findings above, the relationship between V̇O2 and elbow flexion moment can be described by a linear equation, under the conditions of this study (isometric, and force levels up to 70%). These findings suggest that load sharing is independent of force level and that next to EMG, V̇O2 can be used for the validation of musculoskeletal models. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {This study aimed at investigating concurrent changes in cognitive control and cerebral oxygenation (Cox) during steady intense exercise to volitional exhaustion. Fifteen participants were monitored using prefrontal near-infrared spectroscopy and electromyography of the thumb muscles during the completion of an Eriksen flanker task completed either at rest (control condition) or while cycling at a strenuous intensity until exhaustion (exercise condition). Two time windows were matched between the conditions to distinguish a potential exercise-induced evolutive cognitive effect: an initial period and a terminal period. In the initial period, Cox remained unaltered and, contrary to theoretical predictions, exercise did not induce any deficit in selective response inhibition. Rather, the drop-off of the delta curve as reaction time lengthened suggested enhanced efficiency of cognitive processes in the first part of the exercise bout. Shortly before exhaustion, Cox values were severely reduced - though not characteristic of a hypofrontality state - while no sign of deficit in selective response inhibition was observed. Despite this, individual's susceptibility to making fast impulsive errors increased and less efficient online correction of incorrect activation was observed near exhaustion. A negative correlation between Cox values and error rate was observed and is discussed in terms of cerebral resources redistribution.},

abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the replacement of conventional grid by air gap in axiolateral hip radiographs. The optimal air gap distance was studied with respect to radiation dose and image quality using phantom images, as well as 26 patient axiolateral hip radiographs. Methods: The CDRAD phantom, along with polymethylmethacrylate slabs with thicknesses of 10.0, 14.6, and 20.0 cm was employed. The inverse image quality index and dose area product (DAP), as well as their combination, so called figure-of-merit (FOM) parameter, were evaluated for these images, with air gaps from 20 to 50 cm in increments of 10 cm. Images were compared to those acquired using a conventional grid utilized in hip radiography. Radiation dose was measured and kept constant at the surface of the detector by using a reference dosimeter. Verbal consent was asked from 26 patients to participate to the study. Air gap distances from 20 to 50 cm and tube current-time products from 8 to 50 mAs were employed. Exposure index, DAP, as well as patient height and weight were recorded. Two radiologists evaluated the image quality of 26 hip axiolateral projection images on a 3-point nondiagnostic — good/sufficiently good — too good scale. Source-to-image distance of 200 cm and peak tube voltage of 90 kVp were used in both studies. Results and conclusion: Based on the phantom study, it is possible to reduce radiation dose by replacing conventional grid with air gap without compromising image quality. The optimal air gap distance appears to be 30 cm, based on the FOM analysis. Patient study corroborates this observation, as sufficiently good image quality was found in 24 of 26 patient radiographs, with 7 of 26 images obtained with 30 cm air gap. Thus, air gap method, with an air gap distance of 30 cm, is recommended in axiolateral hip radiography.},

Ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) was administered to induce acidification and furosemide was used to induce alkalization. Nine healthy volunteers (six men and three women aged 35 ± 18 years) ingested a calculated amount of NH4Cl at t = 0 and a repeat dose after 60 min. Eight healthy volunteers (three men and five women aged 37 ± 16 years) consumed 40 mg of furosemide. Arterialized capillary blood gases were measured at t = 0, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 min. In the case of acute metabolic acidosis, the target acidification of 2 mequiv {\textperiodcentered} l-1 was attained after 30 min and the greatest change was achieved at 90 min: -4.9 (2.2) mequiv {\textperiodcentered} l-1.

Significant (P < 0.05) changes in acidification compared with baseline BE values were found between 60 and 180 min; significant (P < 0.05) changes in alkalization were found between 120 and 150 min.

abstract = {The goal of this study was to assess the effects of repeated running bouts with end-expiratory breath holding (EEBH) up to the breaking point on muscle oxygenation. Eight male runners participated in three randomised sessions each including two exercises on a motorised treadmill. The first exercise consisted in performing 10–12 running bouts with EEBH of maximum duration either (separate sessions) at 60% (active recovery), 80% (passive recovery) or 100% (passive recovery) of the maximal aerobic velocity (MAV). Each repetition started at the onset of EEBH and ended at its release. In the second exercise of the session, subjects replicated the same procedure but with normal breathing (NB). Arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate (HR) and the change in vastus lateralis muscle deoxy-haemoglobin/myoglobin ($\Delta$[HHb/Mb]) and total haemoglobin/myoglobin ($\Delta$[THb/Mb]) were continuously monitored throughout exercises. On average, the EEBHs were maintained for 10.1 ± 1.1 s, 13.2 ± 1.8 s and 12.2 ± 1.7 s during exercise at 60%, 80% and 100% of MAV, respectively. In the three exercise intensities, SpO2 (mean nadir values: 76.3 ± 2.5 vs 94.5 ± 2.5%) and HR were lower with EEBH than with NB at the end of the repetitions; whereas, the mean $\Delta$[HHb/Mb] (12.6 ± 5.2 vs 7.7 ± 4.4 µm) and $\Delta$[THb/Mb] (− 0.6 ± 2.3 vs 3.8 ± 2.6 µm) were, respectively, higher and lower with EEBH (p < 0.05). This study showed that performing repeated bouts of running exercises with EEBH up to the breaking point induced a large and early drop in muscle oxygenation compared with the same exercise with NB. This phenomenon was probably the consequence of the strong arterial oxygen desaturation induced by the maximal EEBHs.},

abstract = {L-arginine is used as a nitric oxide related supplement intended to improve sports performance, and to enhance muscular recovery during exercise. However, the literature is inconclusive. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of acute oral L-arginine supplementation on O2 consumption kinetics and local muscle blood volume and oxygenation during treadmill running at two different intensities. Using a double-blind, crossover and placebo-controlled design, 11 young healthy male adults were randomly assigned to 6 g of L-arginine (ARG) or placebo (PLA) supplementation that was ingested 60 min before the exercise test. Tests consisted of treadmill run at two different intensities (5 min each; moderate, 90% of ventilatory threshold, VT; and heavy, 50% of the difference between VT and VO2peak) interspersed by 1-min walking. Respiratory gas exchange variables were measured continuously with an automated metabolic cart. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to continuously monitor muscle oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin and total hemoglobin. Blood samples were collected before supplementation and 6 min after exercise. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA did not show differences in plasma nitrite concentrations between ARG or PLA conditions during the running tests. No significant differences were observed between ARG and PLA conditions for O2 kinetics as well as for NIRS variables. ARG supplementation does not improve physiological responses associated with oxygen cost and NIRS variables during running treadmill tests. Hence, our results do not support the use of L-arginine as an ergogenic aid for running performance in young healthy males.},

abstract = {The robust characterization of real-time brain activity carries potential for many applications. However, the contamination of measured signals by various instrumental, environmental, and physiological sources of noise introduces a substantial amount of signal variance and, consequently, challenges real-time estimation of contributions from underlying neuronal sources. Functional near infra-red spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an emerging imaging modality whose real-time potential is yet to be fully explored. The objectives of the current study are to (i) validate a time-dependent linear model of hemodynamic responses in fNIRS, and (ii) test the robustness of this approach against measurement noise (instrumental and physiological) and mis-specification of the hemodynamic response basis functions (amplitude, latency, and duration). We propose a linear hemodynamic model with time-varying parameters, which are estimated (adapted and tracked) using a dynamic recursive least square algorithm. Owing to the linear nature of the activation model, the problem of achieving robust convergence to an accurate estimation of the model parameters is recast as a problem of parameter error stability around the origin. We show that robust convergence of the proposed method is guaranteed in the presence of an acceptable degree of model misspecification and we derive an upper bound on noise under which reliable parameters can still be inferred. We also derived a lower bound on signal-to-noise-ratio over which the reliable parameters can still be inferred from a channel/voxel. Whilst here applied to fNIRS, the proposed methodology is applicable to other hemodynamic-based imaging technologies such as functional magnetic resonance imaging.},

The huge number of review articles about a wide spectrum of topics in the field of cognitive and social sciences, functional neuroimaging research, and medicine testifies to the maturity achieved by this non-invasive optical vascular-based functional neuroimaging technique. Today, fNIRS has started to be utilized on healthy subjects while moving freely in different naturalistic settings. Further instrumental developments are expected to be done in the near future to fully satisfy this latter important aspect. In addition, fNIRS procedures, including correction methods for the strong extracranial interferences, need to be standardized before using fNIRS as a clinical tool in individual patients. New research avenues such as interactive neurosciences, cortical activation modulated by different type of sport performance, and cortical activation during neurofeedback training are highlighted.},

Methods: Eight male participants (26 ± 6 years, 76.3 ± 8.6 kg, 178.5 ± 3.6 cm, 51.4 ± 8.0 mL kg − 1  min − 1 V˙ O 2max ) completed three exercise trials in environmental conditions of severe hypoxia (F I O 2 0.114), moderate hypoxia (F I O 2 0.152), and normoxia (F I O 2 0.202). They were instructed to continually adjust their power output to maintain a perceived effort (RPE) of 16, exercising until power output declined to 80% of the peak 30-s power output achieved. Results: Exercise time was reduced (severe hypoxia 428 ± 210 s; moderate hypoxia 1044 ± 384 s; normoxia 1550 ± 590 s) according to a reduction in F I O 2 (P < 0.05). The rate of oxygen desaturation during the first 3 min of exercise was accelerated in severe hypoxia (− 5.3 ± 2.8% min − 1 ) relative to moderate hypoxia (− 2.5 ± 1.0% min − 1 ) and normoxia (− 0.7 ± 0.3% min − 1 ). Muscle tissue oxygenation did not differ between conditions (P > 0.05). Minute ventilation increased at a faster rate according to a decrease in F I O 2 (severe hypoxia 27.6 ± 6.6; moderate hypoxia 21.8 ± 3.9; normoxia 17.3 ± 3.9 L min − 1 ). Moderate-to-strong correlations were identified between breathing frequency (r = − 0.718, P < 0.001), blood oxygen saturation (r = 0.611, P = 0.002), and exercise performance. Conclusions: The primary cues for determining perceived effort relate to progressive arterial hypoxemia and increases in ventilation.},

abstract = {Training under high interference conditions through interleaved practice (IP) results in performance suppression during training but enhances long-term performance relative to repetitive practice (RP) involving low interference. Previous neuroimaging work addressing this contextual interference effect of motor learning has relied heavily on the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methodology resulting in mixed reports of prefrontal cortex (PFC) recruitment under IP and RP conditions. We sought to clarify these equivocal findings by imaging bilateral PFC recruitment using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) while discrete key pressing sequences were trained under IP and RP schedules and subsequently tested following a 24-h delay. An advantage of fNIRS over the fMRI BOLD response is that the former measures oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin changes independently allowing for assessment of cortical hemodynamics even when there is neurovascular decoupling. Despite slower sequence performance durations under IP, bilateral PFC oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin values did not differ between practice conditions. During test, however, slower performance from those previously trained under RP coincided with hemispheric asymmetry in PFC recruitment. Specifically, following RP, test deoxygenated hemoglobin values were significantly lower in the right PFC. The present findings contrast with previous behavioral demonstrations of increased cognitive demand under IP to illustrate a more complex involvement of the PFC in the contextual interference effect. IP and RP incur similar levels of bilateral PFC recruitment, but the processes underlying the recruitment are dissimilar. PFC recruitment during IP supports action reconstruction and memory elaboration while RP relies on PFC recruitment to maintain task variation information in working memory from trial to trial. While PFC recruitment under RP serves to enhance immediate performance, it does not support long-term performance.},

abstract = {Background: Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating disorder that impacts mobility and function. The benefits of exercise on multiple sclerosis symptoms have been demonstrated. Exercise is proven to increase cerebral blood flow, and improve oxygen utilization which may potentially help in counteracting the hypometabolic component of multiple sclerosis. However, barriers to exercise in people with multiple sclerosis limits their participation in long term exercise. Purpose: The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effects of a 7 consecutive day aquatic aerobic exercise intervention on mobility, fitness, body composition, and self-efficacy. A further purpose of this investigation was to determine the effects of the exercise intervention on cerebral oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, and % tissue saturation index (%TSI). Methods: Twenty-one individuals diagnosed with multiple sclerosis were assigned to the exercise group or the non-exercise group. Both groups participated in a pretest and post-test separated by 7 days. The pre/post-test anthropometric measures included height, weight, BMI, hip and waist circumference measures. In addition, blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, body temperature, and resting heart rate were recorded. Mobility was assessed through the timed up and go test (TUG) and the 25-foot walk test (T25-FW), and fitness was assessed through the 2-minute step test. The Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy questionnaire was used to assess self-efficacy. Oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, total hemoglobin and % TSI were measured using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). The non-exercise group was asked to maintain their lifestyle during the 7 days between the pretest and post-test, while the exercise group participated in 1 hour of aquatic aerobic exercise for each of the 7 days between the pretest and post-test. Change scores were calculated for each variable of the pretest and post-test and the non-exercise and exercise groups were compared using independent samples t-tests for each of these scores. Results: Although there were no statistically significant differences between the exercise and non-exercise groups for mobility, fitness, body composition, self-efficacy, or cerebral oxygenation, there were small clinically meaningful improvements. In mobility (T25-FW), 8/11 exercise participants improved while only 1/9 in the non-exercise group showed improvement. Similar small improvements were demonstrated in the two minute step test used to assess fitness. Cerebral oxygenation also showed improved blood flow through improved oxyhemoglobin and total hemoglobin and improved oxygen utilization through the deoxyhemoglobin response.  Conclusion: Seven consecutive days of moderate intensity exercise can produce small clinically meaningful changes through improved mobility, fitness, self-efficacy and cerebral oxygen utilization.},

abstract = {Portable near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) devices were originally developed for use in exercise and sports science by Britton Chance in the 1990s (the RunMan and microRunman series). However, only recently with the development of more robust, and wireless systems, has the routine use in elite sport become possible. As with the medical use of NIRS, finding applications of the technology that are relevant to practitioners is the key issue. One option is to use NIRS to track exercise training-induced adaptations in muscle. Portable NIRS devices enable monitoring during the normal 'field' routine uses to assess fitness, such as repeat sprint shuttle tests. Knowledge about the acute physiological responses to these specific tests has practical applications within team sport training prescription, where development of both central and peripheral determinants of high-intensity intermittent exercise needs to be considered. The purpose of this study was to observe NIRS-detected parameters during a repeat sprint test. We used the PortaMon, a two wavelength spatially resolved NIR spectrometer manufactured by Artinis Inc., to assess NIR changes in the gastrocnemius muscle of both the left and right leg during high-intensity running. Six university standard rugby players were assessed (age 20 ± 1.5 years; height 183 ± 1.0 cm; weight 89.4 ± 5.8 kg; body fat 12.2 ± 3.0 %); the subjects completed nine repeated shuttle runs, which incorporated forward, backward and change of direction movements. Individual sprint time, total time to complete test, blood lactate response (BL), heart rate values (HR) and haemoglobin variables ($\Delta$HHb, $\Delta$tHb, $\Delta$HbO<inf>2</inf> and $\Delta$TSI%) were measured. Total time to complete the test was 260 ± 20 s, final blood lactate was 14.3 ± 2.8 mM, and maximal HR 182 ± 5 bpm. NIRS variables displayed no differences between right and left legs. During the test, the group-averaged data showed a clear decrease in HbO<inf>2</inf> (max. decrease 11.41 ± 4.95 $\mu$M), increase in HHb (max. increase 17.65 ± 4.48 $\mu$M) and drop in %TSI (max. drop-24.44 ± 4.63 %). tHb was largely unchanged. However, large interindividual differences were seen for all the NIRS parameters. In conclusion, this observational study suggests that a portable NIRS device is both robust and sensitive enough to detect haemoglobin changes during a high-intensity repeated shuttle run test. It therefore has the possibility to be used to assess exercise training-induced adaptations following a specific training protocol. However, it is at present unclear, given the individual variability, whether NIRS can be used to assess individual performance. We recommend that future studies report individual as well as group data. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Ophthalmic filters have been used in the treatment of migraine, and they reduce the haemodynamic response.Methods: The present study used near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to characterise the haemodynamic response to a range of visual stimuli in 20 patients with migraine (15 with aura and 5 without) and paired controls in order to assess the effect of ophthalmic treatment. In an initial study, the response to three stimuli (chequerboard, and two gratings of different spatial frequency) was measured. In a second study, using the mid-spatial frequency grating as stimulus, the response was compared when precision spectral filters (PSF), grey filters or filters of control colour were worn as ophthalmic lenses.Results: In the first study the time course of the response differed between the groups. The difference was most distinct for the grating with mid-spatial frequency. In the second study the PSF broadened (normalised) the haemodynamic response in migraineurs relative to controls, consistent with fMRI BOLD findings and suggesting a physiological mechanism for their reported efficacy. In neither study were there differences in the amplitude of the response between migraine and control groups or indeed between filters.Conclusion: The time course of the functional response as measured by NIRS may be an effective tool to track therapy with PSF and explore the mechanisms of visual stress in migraine. {\textcopyright} International Headache Society 2012.},

abstract = {Objectives: Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS), suitable for dynamic measurements, is not routinely used for peripheral arterial disease (PAD). We propose a dynamic NIRS-based measurement to quantify variations in muscle metabolism in PAD. Method: Sixty-seven consecutive PAD patients (males = 56, age 71.6 ± 8.7 years) and 28 healthy subjects (males = 12, age 30.4 ± 11.9 years) were studied. An echo-colour Doppler (ECD) was performed and the ankle-brachial index (ABI) was calculated. Participants performed an incremental treadmill test with NIRS probes on the gastrocnemius. Variations in oxygenated (HbO2), deoxygenated (HHb), total (tHb = HbO2 + HHb), and differential (dHb = HbO2 - HHb) haemoglobin were recorded and quantified as area-under-curve (AUC) within the range 1.7-3.0 km h-1. Heart rate was recorded, and the number of beats in the same interval was calculated (dHr). Results: O2HbAUC, HHbAUC and dHbAUC differed between diseased and non-diseased legs (P < 0.0001) and exhibited different patterns related to PAD severity according to the ABI value. A compensatory heart rate increase was observed in PAD patients. Compared with the ECD positivity for occlusions/stenoses or multiple plaques, only the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of dHbAUC (area = 0.932, P < 0.0001) showed a sensitivity/specificity of 87.6/93.4 for values ≤-197 (LR + LR-: 13.36/0.13).

abstract = {Background: The brain is by far the most metabolically active organ in the body, with overall energy expenditure and local blood-supply closely related to neural activity. Both energy metabolism and cerebral vaso-dilation are dependent on adequate micronutrient status. This study investigated whether supplementation with ascending doses of multi-vitamin/minerals could modulate the metabolic and cerebral blood-flow consequences of performing cognitive tasks that varied in difficulty. Methods: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-groups study 97 healthy females (25-49 y), who were not selected on the basis of any nutritional parameters, received either placebo or one of two doses of multivitamins/minerals. Cerebral blood-flow (CBF) parameters in the frontal cortex, and total energy expenditure (TotalEnergy), carbohydrate and fat oxidation (CarbOxi/FatOxi), were measured during 5 tasks of graded cognitive difficulty and a control task (5 min per task) using Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and Indirect calorimetry of exhaled pulmonary gas (ICa) respectively. Assessments took place 60 min after the first dose and following eight weeks supplementation. Results: During task performance supplementation with the first dose of micronutrients led to a dose-dependent increase in TotalEnergy and FatOxi throughout the post-dose assessment period following the higher dose, and increases in the total concentration of haemoglobin, a proxy measure for CBF, during task performance following the lower dose of vitamins/minerals (also containing coenzyme-Q10). Chronic supplementation over 8 weeks led to a dose-dependent increase in TotalEnergy during the task period. There were no interpretable effects on mood or cognitive performance. Conclusions: These results show that acute supplementation with micronutrients in healthy adults can modulate metabolic parameters and cerebral blood flow during cognitive task performance, and that the metabolic consequences are sustained during chronic supplementation. These findings suggest that both brain function and metabolism are amenable to micronutrient supplementation, even in adults who are assumed to have nutritional status typical of the population.

abstract = {Background: Sprint interval training (SIT) can be as effective, or more effective, than continuous moderate intensity exercise (CMIE) for improving a primary risk factor for cardiometabolic disease, low cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). However, there has been no direct comparison in inactive individuals, of the acute effects of a session of SIT with a work-matched session of CMIE on local oxygen utilisation, which is a primary stimulus for increasing CRF. Furthermore, post-exercise blood pressure (BP) and enjoyment, if symptomatic and low, respectively, have implications for safety and adherence to exercise and have not been compared between these specific conditions. It was hypothesised that in young inactive men, local oxygen utilisation would be higher, while post-exercise BP and enjoyment would be lower for SIT, when compared to CMIE. Methods: A total of 11 inactive men (mean ± SD; age 23 ± 4 years) completed a maximal ramp-incremental exercise test followed by two experiment conditions: (1) SIT and (2) work-matched CMIE on a cycle ergometer on separate days. Deoxygenated haemoglobin ($\Delta$HHb) in the pre-frontal cortex (FH), gastrocnemius (GN), left vastus lateralis (LVL) and the right vastus lateralis (RVL) muscles, systemic oxygen utilisation (VO2), systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure and physical activity enjoyment scale (PACES) were measured during the experiment conditions. Results: During SIT, compared to CMIE, $\delta$HHb in FH (p = 0.016) and GN (p = 0.001) was higher, while PACES (p = 0.032) and DBP (p = 0.043) were lower. No differences in SBP and $\Delta$HHb in LVL and RVL were found between conditions. Conclusions: In young inactive men, higher levels of physiological stress occurred during SIT, which potentially contributed to lower levels of post-exercise DBP and enjoyment, when compared to CMIE.},

abstract = {Working memory is sensitive to aging-related decline. Evidence exists that aging is accompanied by a reorganization of the working-memory circuitry, but the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we examined aging-related changes in prefrontal activation during working-memory performance using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), a noninvasive neuroimaging technique. Seventeen healthy young (21-32 years) and 17 healthy older adults (64-81 years) performed a verbal working-memory task (n-back). Oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin concentration changes were registered by two fNIRS channels located over the left and right prefrontal cortex. Increased working-memory load resulted in worse performance compared to the control condition in older adults, but not in young participants. In both young and older adults, prefrontal activation increased with rising working-memory load. Young adults showed slight right-hemispheric dominance at low levels of working-memory load, while no hemispheric differences were apparent in older adults. Analysis of the time-activation curve during the high working-memory load condition revealed a continuous increase of the hemodynamic response in the young. In contrast to that, a quadratic pattern of activation was found in the older participants. Based on these results it could be hypothesized that young adults were better able to keep the prefrontal cortex recruited over a prolonged period of time. To conclude, already at low levels of working-memory load do older adults recruit both hemispheres, possibly in an attempt to compensate for the observed aging-related decline in performance. Also, our study shows that aging effects on the time course of the hemodynamic response must be taken into account in the interpretation of the results of neuroimaging studies that rely on blood oxygen levels, such as fMRI. {\textcopyright} 2012 Vermeij et al.},

abstract = {Previous attempts to detect global cerebral hemodynamic differences between those who develop headache, nausea, and fatigue following rapid exposure to hypoxia [acute mountain sickness (AMS)] and those who remain healthy have been inconclusive. In this study, we investigated the effects of two drugs known to reduce symptoms of AMS to determine if a common cerebral hemodynamic mechanism could explain the prophylactic effect within individuals. With the use of randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover design, 20 healthy volunteers were given oral acetazolamide (250 mg), dexamethasone (4 mg), or placebo every 8 h for 24 h prior to and during a 10-h exposure to a simulated altitude of 4,875 m in a hypobaric chamber, which included 2 h of exercise at 50% of altitude-specific V̇O2max. Cerebral hemodynamic parameters derived from ultrasound assessments of dynamic cerebral autoregulation and vasomotor reactivity were recorded 15 h prior to and after 9 h of hypoxia. AMS symptoms were scored using the Lake Louise Questionnaire (LLQ). It was found that both drugs prevented AMS in those who became ill on placebo (∼70% decrease in LLQ), yet a common cerebral hemodynamic mechanism was not identified. Compared with placebo, acetazolamide reduced middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (11%) and improved dynamic cerebral autoregulation after 9 h of hypoxia, but these effects appeared independent of AMS. Dexamethasone had no measureable cerebral hemodynamic effects in hypoxia. In conclusion, global cerebral hemodynamic changes resulting from hypoxia may not explain the development of AMS. {\textcopyright} 2011 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract = {Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an emerging neuro-imaging modality that can indicate cortical functionality with good temporal resolution (0.5-1 sec). Unlike fMRI, up to now, there is no standard method and a whole package that can perform signal processing and data analysis for fNIRS dataset. This thesis is focused on developing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) model in MATLAB that can perform both signal and data analysis for data collected by mobile fNIRS devices either in offline or online mode. It can remove motion artifacts using detrending methods and performs Band Pass Filtering using the low-and high-pass cutoff frequencies of 0.6 and 0.01 Hz, respectively and check the quality of signal in term of Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). The filtered fNIRS signals were then sent to a General Linear Model (GLM) to estimate the linear model parameters. T-statistical values have been calculated and unrelated values have been further removed prior to obtaining results in terms of evoked related potentials, 2D and 3D head projections. In this thesis, signal processing and data analysis have assessed in the proposed GUI through the data of four participants [three males, age of 22, 24, 28 and, one female, age of 19] collected from two different fNIRS systems. Results for both systems verified when signal is de-trended using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and it is filtered using a BPF order 4, cutoff frequencies of 0.01 to 0.6 Hz) the SNR value of 6.99 dB from ARTINIS system was achieved. Brain mapping results are shown with both hand motor imagery, the subjects consumed more hemoglobin in their both hemispheres. To localize each optode position, more accurately and complicated methods like 3D digitizer can be replaced with 10-20 standard system. With advantages such as hazard-free application, motion artifact robustness and the possibility to miniaturize hardware, fNIRS may enable new applications in the BCI context, in clinical tools and diagnosis and further contribute to new insights in brain research and neuroscience.},

abstract = {Background To demonstrate the feasibility of using a susceptibility-based MRI technique with asymmetric spin-echo (ASE) sequence to assess the lower extremity muscle oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) alternations under cuff compression paradigm. Methods Approved by the local institutional human study committee, nine healthy young volunteers participated in this study. All the ASE scans were conducted using a 3 Tesla clinical MRI scanner during resting state (pre), 1-3 min (post1) and 3-5 min (post2) after a pressure of 50 mmHg above individual systolic blood pressure imposed on the thigh. Moreover, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements were performed on the same day under the same cuff compression protocol to verify the accuracy of this susceptibility-based method. Results In all volunteers, the mean MRI based OEF in gastrocnemius (GAS) muscle increased significantly from 0.28 ± 0.02 (pre) to 0.31 ± 0.03 (post1, P < 0.05) and 0.31 ± 0.03 (post2, P < 0.05). In addition, mean OEF in soleus (SOL) muscle went up from 0.31 ± 0.01 (pre) to 0.33 ± 0.03 (post1, P = 0.14) and 0.37 ± 0.04 (post2, P < 0.05). For comparison, NIRS measured 1-%HbO2 (percentage of deoxyhemoglobin concentration within total hemoglobin) in GAS rose significantly from 0.29 ± 0.03 (pre) to 0.31 ± 0.04 (post1, P < 0.05) and 0.31 ± 0.04 (post2, P < 0.05), which confirmed the accuracy of the MRI-based OEF. Conclusion This susceptibility-based OEF quantification technique together with cuff compression paradigm could provide a noninvasive, quantifiable and effective tool for measuring skeletal muscle oxygenation.},

@thesis{colier_near_1995,
abstract = {A short history of oximetry During the second half of the 19th century it was discovered that blood cells contain a colouring substance whose spectrum is influenced by various blood gases [Hoppe, 1862]. Stokes discovered that this coloured substance was the oxygen carrier of the blood. Felix Hoppe-Seyler, a German chemist, named the substance haemoglobin. He found that when shaking a solution of haemoglobin with air this resulted in a spectral change. He called the component responsible for this change "oxyhaemoglobin". In 1876 Karl von Vierordt published the first study in which spectroscopy was used to study haemoglobin in tissue. He found a transition from oxyhaemoglobin to deoxyhaemoglobin in the tissue of the finger after the arm was fully occluded, a technique still practised today to study oxygenation in muscles (refer to Figure 1.2 at page 16). At the begining of the 20th century oximetry developed rapidly in Germany with scientists like Nicolai [1932], Kramer [1934], Matthes [1942] and Gross. Last two scientists mentioned were the first to use a wavelength region in the near infrared where absorption was independent of the oxygenation status of blood and which could therefore compensate for changes in blood volume, light scattering and tissue thickness [Matthes et al. 1939]. Their instrumentation however was still very bulky and not easy to use. The first portable instrument measuring haemoglobin saturation in tissue accurately and automatically was built and described by Millikan [1942]. He named the instrument an "oximeter". The sensor weighed 30 grams, used two wavelengths and could be slipped over the subject's ear. To obtain arterial saturation the ear was moderately heated, a method also used in later versions of oximeters. Millikan's instrument had an accuracy of 3 to 5% at the higher end of the scale ( — 98% saturation) and an accuracy of 8% at the lower end of the scale ($\sim$50% saturation). The oximeter of Millikan was improved by Wood and Geraci [1949]. Further developments on reflection oximetry were done by Brinkman and Zijlstra. They developed the "Cyclops", a device measuring oxygen saturation on the forehead of a subject [Brinkman et al. 1950]. In the following years, oximetry was used more and more in clinical situations. The title of Zijlstra's thesis [1951]: "Fundamentals and applications of clinical oximetry" indicated that they were far ahead of their time. In the seventies two important findings contributed to the development and clinical applicability of oximetry. The first was by Aoyagi, who found that the variations in arterial blood volume could be used to obtain a signal dependent only on arterial blood changes. With this knowledge the arterial oxygen saturation of the blood could be measured [Aoyagi et al. 1974, Nakajima et al. 1975]. This technique 10 Introduction was called pulse oximetry and has been developed into a reliable and widely used method [Kelleher 1989]. The second finding was by J{\'{o}}bsis [1977] and was the beginning of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)},

abstract = {Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with a high incidence of ischemic stroke. SCD is characterized by hemolytic anemia, resulting in reduced nitric oxide-bioavailability, and by impaired cerebrovascular hemodynamics. Cerebrovascular CO2 responsiveness is nitric oxide dependent and has been related to an increased stroke risk in microvascular diseases. We questioned whether cerebrovascular CO2 responsiveness is impaired in SCD and related to hemolytic anemia. Transcranial Doppler-determined mean cerebral blood flow velocity (Vmean), near-infrared spectroscopy-determined cerebral oxygenation, and end-tidal CO2 tension were monitored during normocapnia and hypercapnia in 23 patients and 16 control subjects. Cerebrovascular CO2 responsiveness was quantified as $\Delta$% Vmean and $\Delta$$\mu$mol/L cerebral oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, and total hemoglobin per mm Hg change in end-tidal CO 2 tension. Both ways of measurements revealed lower cerebrovascular CO2 responsiveness in SCD patients versus controls (Vmean, 3.7, 3.1-4.7 vs 5.9, 4.6-6.7 $\Delta$% Vmean per mm Hg, P < .001; oxyhemoglobin, 0.36, 0.14-0.82 vs 0.78, 0.61-1.22 $\Delta$$\mu$mol/L per mm Hg, P = .025; deoxyhemoglobin, 0.35, 0.14-0.67 vs 0.58, 0.41-0.86 $\Delta$$\mu$mol/L per mm Hg, P = .033; total-hemoglobin, 0.13, 0.02-0.18 vs 0.23, 0.13-0.38 $\Delta$$\mu$mol/L per mm Hg, P = .038). Cerebrovascular CO2 responsiveness was not related to markers of hemolytic anemia. In SCD patients, impaired cerebrovascular CO2 responsiveness reflects reduced cerebrovascular reserve capacity, which may play a role in pathophysiology of stroke. {\textcopyright} 2009 by The American Society of Hematology.},

Twelve subjects performed an hour-long, simulated occupational task ina laboratory setting. Independent measures of exoskeleton, exertion height (overhead, head height), time, and their interactions were assessed. Dependent measures included changes in tis-sue oxygenation (DTSI) in the anterior deltoid and middle trapezius, peak resultant lumbar spine loading, and subjective discomfort in various body regions. A statistically significant reduction inDTSI between exoskeleton and control was only observed in one instance. Additionally, neither increases in spinal loading nor increases in subjective discomfort ratings were observed for anyof the exoskeletons. Ultimately, the exoskeletons offered little to no physiological benefit for the conditions tested. However, the experimental task was not highly fatiguing to the subjects, denoted by low DTSI values across conditions.

abstract = {After an active muscle stretch, maintaining a certain amount of force in the following isometric phase is accompanied by less muscle activation compared to an isometric contraction without preceding active stretch at the corresponding muscle length. This reduced muscle activation might be related to reduced metabolic costs, such as the oxidative metabolism. Hence, the aim of this study was to clarify if mechanisms associated with stretch-induced activation reduction (AR) also influence oxygen consumption of voluntary activated human muscles after active stretch. Plantarflexion torque of 20 subjects was measured during 1) purely isometric and 2) active stretch contractions (26°, 60°/s), at a submaximal torque level of 30% MVC. Oxygen consumption (m VO2) of gastrocnemius medialis (GM) was estimated by near-infrared spectroscopy while applying arterial occlusion. Since the overall group did not show AR at GM after active stretch (p > 0.19), a subgroup was defined (n = 10) showing AR of 13.0 ± 10.3% (p = 0.00). However, for both purely isometric and active contractions m VO2 was the same (p = 0.32). Therefore, AR triggered by active stretch did not affect m VO2 of active human muscle.},

abstract = {Although acute hypoxia is of utmost pathophysiologic relevance in health and disease, studies on its effects on both the macro- and microcirculation are scarce. Herein, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the effects of acute normobaric hypoxia on human macro- and microcirculation. 20 healthy participants were enrolled in this study. Hypoxia was induced in a normobaric hypoxia chamber by decreasing the partial pressure of oxygen in inhaled air stepwisely (pO2; 21.25 kPa (0 k), 16.42 kPa (2 k), 12.63 kPa (4 k) and 9.64 kPa (6 k)). Macrocirculatory effects were assessed by cardiac output measurements, microcirculatory changes were investigated by sidestream dark-field imaging in the sublingual capillary bed and videocapillaroscopy at the nailfold. Exposure to hypoxia resulted in a decrease of systemic vascular resistance (p < 0.0001) and diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.014). Concomitantly, we observed an increase in heart rate (p < 0.0001) and an increase of cardiac output (p < 0.0001). In the sublingual microcirculation, exposure to hypoxia resulted in an increase of total vessel density, proportion of perfused vessels and perfused vessel density. Furthermore, we observed an increase in peripheral capillary density. Exposure to acute hypoxia results in vasodilatation of resistance arteries, as well as recruitment of microvessels of the central and peripheral microcirculation. The observed macro- and microcirculatory effects are most likely a result from compensatory mechanisms to ensure adequate tissue oxygenation.},

Eleven healthy participants, range 21–51 years old, with a minimum of 1-year work experience, carried out the task of loading logs along a standardized path in a machine simulator during two counterbalanced test conditions: (i) conventional crane control, and; (ii) semi-automated crane control. Mental load was assessed by quantification of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) concentration changes over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) via non-invasive functional near infrared spectrometry (fNIRS). Visual, autonomic, and motoric control variables were measured and analyzed in parallel along with the individual level of performance. Linear Mixed Models (LMM) analysis indicated more mental load during conventional crane work. Collectively, our data suggest that fNIRS is a viable tool which can be used in neuroergonomic research to evaluate physiological activity levels in PFC.},

abstract = {The potential purpose of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) as a clinical application in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) is the identification of limitations in O2 delivery or utilization during exercise. The objective of this study was to evaluate absolute and relative test–retest reliability of skeletal muscle oxygenation measurements in patients with CHF. Thirty patients with systolic heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction 31 ± 8%) performed 6-min constant-load cycling tests at 80% of the anaerobic threshold (AT) with tissue saturation index (TSI) measurement at the vastus lateralis. Tests were repeated after 10 ± 5 days to evaluate reliability. Absolute reliability was assessed with limits of agreement (LoA, expressed as bias ± random error) and coefficients of variation (CV) for absolute values (LoA range: 0{\textperiodcentered}4 ± 6{\textperiodcentered}2% to 0{\textperiodcentered}6 ± 7{\textperiodcentered}9%; CV range: 4{\textperiodcentered}7–7{\textperiodcentered}1%), amplitudes (LoA range −0{\textperiodcentered}5 ± 5{\textperiodcentered}8% to −0{\textperiodcentered}7 ± 6{\textperiodcentered}8%; CV range: 26{\textperiodcentered}2–42{\textperiodcentered}1%), onset and recovery kinetics (mean response times; LoA 0{\textperiodcentered}4 ± 9{\textperiodcentered}5 s, CV 23{\textperiodcentered}5% and LoA −5{\textperiodcentered}8 ± 50{\textperiodcentered}8 s, CV 67{\textperiodcentered}4% respectively) and overshoot characteristics (CV range 45{\textperiodcentered}7–208{\textperiodcentered}6%). Relative reliability was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficients for absolute values (range 0{\textperiodcentered}74–0{\textperiodcentered}90), amplitudes (range 0{\textperiodcentered}85–0{\textperiodcentered}92), onset and recovery kinetics (0{\textperiodcentered}53 and 0{\textperiodcentered}51, respectively) and overshoot characteristics (range 0{\textperiodcentered}17–0{\textperiodcentered}74). In conclusion, absolute reliability of absolute values and onset kinetics seems acceptable for serial within-subject comparison, and as such, for evaluation of treatment effects. Absolute reliability of amplitudes and recovery kinetics is considered unsatisfactory. Relative reliability of absolute values and amplitudes is sufficient for purposes of physiological distinction between patients with CHF. Despite lower relative reliability, kinetics may still be useful for clinical application.},

abstract = {Introduction: Fatigue is de?ned as a loss in the capacity for developing force and/or velocity of a muscle which is reversible by rest. The aim was to evaluate non-invasively the fatigue and recovery of the inspiratory ribcage muscles during two endurance tests in healthy subjects. Methods: 22 subjects were evaluated before, during and after performing a respiratory endurance test with normocapnic hyperpnea (NH) and inspiratory pressure threshold load (IPTL). Simultaneous measurements of muscle activity (electromyography), tissue oxygenation (NIRS), pressure (nasal inspiratory pressure), and volume (optoelectronic plethysmography) were performed. Results: There was a decrease in the maximum relaxation rate (MRR) and increase in the time constant ($\tau$) after the IPTL test (p <0.05) and a decrease in the peak pressure generated in SNIP after both protocols (p <0.05). Additionally, there was a decrease in shortening velocity and mechanical power only after the IPTL test (p <0.05). The inspiratory ribcage muscles showed a linear drop in the median frequency in the IPTL test and an exponential drop in the NH test, which was not signi?cant for the development of fatigue and there was a linear increase in the NIRS variables in both protocols. Conclusion: It was concluded that the inspiratory ribcage muscles undergo changes after performing an endurance test with NH and IPTL. Additionally, the development of fatigue in these muscles and their consequent changes are more evident in the protocol with IPTL.},

abstract = {Technological advances in avionics systems and components have facilitated the introduction of progressively more integrated and automated Human-Machine Interfaces and Interactions (HMI2) on-board civil and military aircraft. A detailed review of these HMI2 evolutions is presented, addressing both manned aircraft (fixed and rotary wing) and Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) specificities for the most fundamental flight tasks: aviate, navigate, communicate and manage. Due to the large variability in mission requirements, greater emphasis is given to safety-critical displays, command and control functions as well as associated technology developments. Additionally, a top-level definition of RPAS mission-essential functionalities is provided, addressing planning and real-time decision support for single and multi-aircraft operations. While current displays are able to integrate and fuse information from several sources to perform a range of different functions, these displays have limited adaptability. Further development to increase HMI2 adaptiveness has significant potential to enhance the human operator's effectiveness, thereby contributing to safer and more efficient operations. The adaptive HMI2 concepts in the literature contain three common elements. These elements comprise the ability to assess the system and environmental states; the ability to assess the operator states; and the ability to adapt the HMI2 according to the first two elements. While still an emerging area of research, HMI2 adaptation driven by human performance and cognition has the potential to greatly enhance human-machine teaming through varying the system support according to the user's needs. However, one of the outstanding challenges in the design of such adaptive systems is the development of suitable models and algorithms to describe human performance and cognitive states based on real-time sensor measurements. After reviewing the state-of-research in human performance assessment and adaptation techniques, detailed recommendations are provided to support the integration of such techniques in the HMI2 of future Communications, Navigations, Surveillance (CNS), Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) and Avionics (CNS + A) systems.},

abstract = {Purpose: We investigated the cardiovascular individual response to 6 weeks (3×/week) of work-matched within the severe-intensity domain (high-intensity interval training, HIIT) or moderate-intensity domain (moderate-intensity continuous training, MICT). In addition, we analyzed the cardiovascular factors at baseline underlying the response variability. Methods: 42 healthy sedentary participants were randomly assigned to HIIT or MICT. We applied the region of practical equivalence-method for identifying the levels of responders to the maximal oxygen uptake (V̇O2max) response. For investigating the influence of cardiovascular markers, we trained a Bayesian machine learning model on cardiovascular markers. Results: Despite that HIIT and MICT induced significant increases in V̇O2max, HIIT had greater improvements than MICT (p < 0.001). Greater variability was observed in MICT, with approximately 50% classified as “non-responder” and “undecided”. 20 “responders”, one “undecided” and no “non-responders” were observed in HIIT. The variability in the ∆V̇O2max was associated with initial cardiorespiratory fitness, arterial stiffness, and left-ventricular (LV) mass and LV end-diastolic diameter in HIIT; whereas, microvascular responsiveness and right-ventricular (RV) excursion velocity showed a significant association in MICT. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the critical influence of exercise-intensity domains and biological variability on the individual V̇O2max response. The incidence of “non-responders” in MICT was one third of the group; whereas, no “non-responders” were observed in HIIT. The incidence of “responders” was 11 out of 21 participants in MICT, and 20 out of 21 participants in HIIT. The response in HIIT showed associations with baseline fitness, arterial stiffness, and LV-morphology; whereas, it was associated with RV systolic function in MICT.},

abstract = {Background: Nitrate is a precursor of nitric oxide (NO), an important regulator of cerebral perfusion in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Nitrate supplementation could be used to improve cerebral perfusion and oxygenation during exercise in hypoxia. The effects of dietary nitrate supplementation on cerebral haemodynamics during exercise in severe hypoxia (arterial O2 saturation < 70%) have not been explored. Methods: In twelve trained male cyclists, we measured blood pressure (BP), middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv), cerebrovascular resistance (CVR) and prefrontal oxyhaemoglobin and deoxyhaemoglobin concentration (O2Hb and HHb, respectively) during 15 km cycling time trials (TT) in normoxia and severe hypoxia (11% inspired O2, peripheral O2 saturation $\sim$66%) following 3-day oral supplementation with placebo or sodium nitrate (0.1 mmol/kg/day) in a randomised, double-blinded manner. We tested the hypothesis that dietary nitrate supplementation increases MCAv and cerebral O2Hb during TT in severe hypoxia. Results: During TT in normoxia, nitrate supplementation lowered MCAv by $\sim$2.3 cm/s and increased cerebral O2Hb by $\sim$6.8 $\mu$M and HHb by $\sim$2.1 $\mu$M compared to normoxia placebo (p = 0.01 for all), while BP tended to be lowered (p = 0.06). During TT in severe hypoxia, nitrate supplementation elevated MCAv (by $\sim$2.5 cm/s) and BP (by $\sim$5 mmHg) compared to hypoxia placebo (p < 0.01 for both), while it had no effect on cerebral O2Hb (p = 0.98), HHb (p = 0.07) or PETCO2 (p = 0.12). Dietary nitrate had no effect of CVR during TT in normoxia or hypoxia (p = 0.19). Conclusion: Our findings indicate that during normoxic TT, the modulatory effect of dietary nitrate on regional and global cerebral perfusion is heterogeneous. Meanwhile, the lack of major changes in cerebral perfusion with dietary nitrate during hypoxic TT alludes to an exhausted cerebrovascular reserve.},

abstract = {The recovery of muscle oxygen consumption (m (Formula presented.) O2) after exercise measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) provides a measure of skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity. Nevertheless, due to sex differences in factors that can influence scattering and thus penetration depth of the NIRS signal in the tissue, e.g., subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness and intramuscular myoglobin and hemoglobin, it is unknown whether results in males can be extrapolated to a female population. Therefore, the aim of this study was to measure skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity in females at different levels of aerobic fitness to test whether NIRS can measure relevant differences in mitochondrial capacity. Mitochondrial capacity was analyzed in the gastrocnemius muscle and the wrist flexors of 32 young female adults, equally divided in relatively high ((Formula presented.) O2peak ≥ 47 ml/kg/min) and relatively low aerobic fitness group ((Formula presented.) O2peak ≤ 37 ml/kg/min). m (Formula presented.) O2 recovery was significantly faster in the high- compared to the low-fitness group in the gastrocnemius, but not in the wrist flexors (p = 0.009 and p = 0.0528, respectively). Furthermore, (Formula presented.) O2peak was significantly correlated to m (Formula presented.) O2 recovery in both gastrocnemius (R2 = 0.27, p = 0.0051) and wrist flexors (R2 = 0.13, p = 0.0393). In conclusion, NIRS measurements can be used to assess differences in mitochondrial capacity within a female population and is correlated to (Formula presented.) O2peak. This further supports NIRS assessment of muscle mitochondrial capacity providing additional evidence for NIRS as a promising approach to monitor mitochondrial capacity, also in an exclusively female population.},

abstract = {Significance: Combining transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a recent approach to exploring brain activation evoked by neurostimulation. Aim: To critically evaluate studies combining tDCS and fNIRS and provide a consolidated overview of cortical hemodynamic responses to neurostimulation. Approach: Key terms were searched in three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO) with cross-referencing and works from Google Scholar also evaluated. All studies reporting on fNIRS-derived hemoglobin changes evoked by tDCS were included. Results: Literature searches revealed 474 articles, of which 28 were included for final review (22 in healthy individuals: 9 involving rest and 13 with tasks; 6 in the clinical setting). At rest, an overall increase in cortical activation was observed in fNIRS responses at the site of stimulation, with evidence suggesting nonstimulated brain regions are also similarly affected. Conversely, during tasks, reduced cortical activation was observed during online stimulation. Offline and poststimulation effects were less consistent, as is the impact on clinical populations and their symptom correlation. Conclusion: This review explores the methodological frameworks for fNIRS-tDCS evaluations and summarizes hemodynamic responses associated with tDCS in all populations. Our findings provide further evidence of the impact of tDCS on neuronal activation within functionally connected networks.},

abstract = {Abnormal levels of pyruvate and lactate were reported in multiple sclerosis (MS). We studied the response of markers of mitochondrial function to rehabilitation in relation to type, intensity and endurance performance in severely disabled MS patients. Forty-six progressive MS patients were randomized to receive 12 walking sessions of robot-assisted gait training (RAGT, n = 23) or conventional overground therapy (CT, n = 23). Ten healthy subjects were also studied. Blood samples were collected to determine lactate, pyruvate, and glutathione levels and lactate/pyruvate ratio pre–post rehabilitation. In vivo muscle metabolism and endurance walking capacity were assessed by resting muscle oxygen consumption (rmVO2) using near-infrared spectroscopy and by six-minute walking distance (6MWD), respectively. The levels of mitochondrial biomarkers and rmVO2, altered at baseline with respect to healthy subjects, improved after rehabilitation in the whole population. In the two groups, an enhanced response was observed after RAGT compared to CT for lactate (p = 0.012), glutathione (<0.001), lactate/pyruvate ratio (p = 0.08) and rmVO2 (p = 0.07). Metabolic biomarkers and 6MWD improvements were exclusively correlated with a training speed markedly below individual gait speed. In severely disabled MS patients, rehabilitation rebalanced altered serum metabolic and muscle parameters, with RAGT being more effective than CT. A determinable slow training speed was associated with better metabolic and functional recovery. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02421731.},

abstract = {Acute hypoxia has previously been suggested to potentiate resistance training-induced hypertrophy by activating satellite cell-dependent myogenesis rather than an improvement in protein balance in human. Here, we tested this hypothesis after a 4-week hypoxic vs normoxic resistance training protocol. For that purpose, 19 physically active male subjects were recruited to perform 6 sets of 10 repetitions of a one-leg knee extension exercise at 80% 1-RM 3 times/week for 4 weeks in normoxia (FiO2: 0.21; n = 9) or in hypoxia (FiO2: 0.135, n = 10). Blood and skeletal muscle samples were taken before and after the training period. Muscle fractional protein synthetic rate was measured over the whole period by deuterium incorporation into the protein pool and muscle thickness by ultrasound. At the end of the training protocol, the strength gain was higher in the hypoxic vs the normoxic group despite no changes in muscle thickness and in the fractional protein synthetic rate. Only early myogenesis, as assessed by higher MyoD and Myf5 mRNA levels, appeared to be enhanced by hypoxia compared to normoxia. No effects were found on myosin heavy chain expression, markers of oxidative metabolism and lactate transport in the skeletal muscle. Though the present study failed to unravel clearly the mechanisms by which hypoxic resistance training is particularly potent to increase muscle strength, it is important message to keep in mind that this training strategy could be effective for all athletes looking at developing and optimizing their maximal muscle strength.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of carbogen breathing on the physiological profile of human glioma xenografts. Near infrared spectroscopy was used to investigate changes in oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations in tumor blood. Oxygen tension changes in tumor tissue were evaluated by 19F-MR relaxometry, using perfluoro-15-crown-5-ether, and modifications of tumor blood perfusion (TBP) were analyzed by fast dynamic 1H-MR imaging of Gd-DTPA uptake. Finally, changes of the bioenergetic status and pH of tumor cells were analyzed by 31P-MRS. After 5 to 8 min of carbogen breathing, the average oxygen tension increase in tumor tissue was 4.6 ± 1.3 mm Hg, which is in agreement with an increase of the oxyhemoglobin concentration in tumor blood ($\Delta$[O2Hb] = 9.2 ± 3 $\mu$M). However, simultaneously the TBP was reduced, the bioenergetic status was diminished, and pH was decreased. As 100% O2 breathing alone did not result in a detectable increase of oxyhemoglobin in tumor blood, the increase of the tumor oxygenation by carbogen appears to be mediated by its CO2 content. This component may cause a nutrient-limited decrease of oxidative energy metabolism, indirectly via a steal-effect and/or by inhibition of the glycolytic rate resulting from tissue acidification.},

abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study was to compare the development and etiology of neuromuscular fatigue of the knee extensor muscles at different muscle-tendon unit (MTU) lengths during repeated maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) between boys and men. Methods Twenty-two prepubertal boys (9-11 yr) and 22 men (18-30 yr) performed three knee extensor fatigue protocols at short (SHORT), optimal (OPT), and long (LONG) MTU lengths, consisting of repeating 5-s MVIC interspersed with 5-s passive recovery periods until torque reached 60% of the initial MVIC torque. The etiology of neuromuscular fatigue was identified using noninvasive methods such as surface electromyography, near-infrared spectroscopy, magnetic nerve stimulation and twitch interpolation technique. Results The number of repetitions was significantly lower in men at OPT (14.8 ± 3.2) and LONG (15.8 ± 5.8) than boys (39.7 ± 18.4 and 29.5 ± 10.2, respectively; P < 0.001), whereas no difference was found at SHORT between both age groups (boys, 33.7 ± 15.4; men, 40.9 ± 14.2). At OPT and LONG boys showed a lower reduction in the single potentiated twitch (Qtwpot) and a greater decrease in the voluntary activation level than men. At SHORT, both populations displayed a moderate Qtwpot decrement and a significant voluntary activation reduction (P < 0.001). The differences in maximal torque between boys and men were almost twice greater at OPT (223.9 N{\textperiodcentered}m) than at SHORT (123.3 N{\textperiodcentered}m) and LONG (136.5 N{\textperiodcentered}m). Conclusions The differences in neuromuscular fatigue between children and adults are dependent on MTU length. Differences in maximal torque could underpin differences in neuromuscular fatigue between children and adults at OPT and SHORT. However, at LONG these differences do not seem to be explained by differences in maximal torque. The origins of this specific effect of MTU length remain to be determined.},

abstract = {Cardiovascular stability, as affected by several diseases, may be assessed by head-up tilt testing. Follow-up studies are essential in both evaluating interventions and assessing progression. However, data on the reproducibility of the changes in circulatory status and cerebral oxygenation provoked by head-up tilt testing are fundamental to follow-up studies. The aim of this study was, therefore, to assess the reproducibility of the alterations in stroke volume (SV), mean arterial pressure (MAP), as well as oxygenated ([O2Hb]) and deoxygenated haemoglobin ([HHb]) concentration in cerebral tissue from supine rest (SUP) to head-up tilt (HUT). SV was calculated by Modelflow, a pulse contour method, from the finger arterial pressure wave measured by Portapres, the portable version of Finapres. [O2Hb] and [HHb] were measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIPS). Ten healthy individuals visited the laboratory on two different days. On both days, they underwent 10 min SUP followed by 10 min 70°HUT twice. SV decreased, which was (in part) compensated for by an increased heart rate, while MAP increased slightly during HUT compared with SUP. Although [HHb] increased during HUT, no presyncope symptoms were experienced. The circulatory variables (SV, HR and MAP) as well as [HHb] showed an acceptably small systematic and random error as well as reproducibility error compared with the observed difference between HUT and SUP and were similar between and within visits. Therefore, it is concluded that MAP measured by Portapres and SV calculated by Modelflow as well as HHb measured by NIRS seem to be reproducible and may therefore be used in follow-up studies.},

abstract = {This study assessed whether hypoxia during high-load resistance exercise could enhance the acute physiological responses related to muscular development. Twelve trained men performed exercise in three conditions: normoxia (fraction of inspired oxygen [FIO2] = 21%), moderate-level hypoxia (FIO2 = 16%) and high-level hypoxia (FIO2 = 13%). Exercise comprised high-load squats and deadlifts (5 × 5 using 80% of 1-repetition maximum with 180-s rest). Muscle oxygenation and activation were monitored during exercise. Metabolic stress was estimated via capillary blood sampling. Perceived fatigue and soreness were also quantified following exercise. While the hypoxic conditions appeared to affect muscle oxygenation, significant differences between conditions were only noted for maximal deoxyhaemoglobin in the deadlift (P = 0{\textperiodcentered}009). Blood lactate concentration increased from 1{\textperiodcentered}1 to 1{\textperiodcentered}2 mmol l−1 at baseline to 9{\textperiodcentered}5–9{\textperiodcentered}8 mmol l−1 after squats and 10{\textperiodcentered}4–10{\textperiodcentered}5 mmol l−1 after deadlifts (P≤0{\textperiodcentered}001), although there were no between-condition differences. Perceived fatigue and muscle soreness were significantly elevated immediately and at 24 h following exercise, respectively, by similar magnitudes in all conditions (P≤0{\textperiodcentered}001). Muscle activation did not differ between conditions. While metabolic stress is thought to moderate muscle activation and subsequent muscular development during hypoxic resistance training, it is not augmented during traditional high-load exercise. This may be explained by the low number of repetitions performed and the long interset rest periods employed during this training. These findings suggest that high-load resistance training might not benefit from additional hypoxia as has been shown for low- and moderate-load training.},

abstract = {In five experiments we measured the amplitude of the haemodynamic response to visual patterns using near infrared spectroscopy of the visual cortex. The patterns were gratings with bars that differed in chromaticity but not in luminance. In all experiments, with a wide range of chromaticities of the grating bars, the amplitude of the haemodynamic response increased with the separation of the chromaticities in the CIE 1976 UCS diagram. The amplitude did not vary consistently with the cone activation, or with the signal in colour difference channels. In four further experiments, again with a wide range of chromaticities, the gratings were rated for visual comfort. Discomfort increased consistently with the separation of the chromaticities. Given that a large haemodynamic response to patterns is generally associated with headache, we suggest that the discomfort may be a homeostatic signal to reduce sustained metabolic load on the visual cortex. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

@article{Posma2010,
abstract = {Purpose: Experimental studies indicate that perioperative hypoperfusion impairs anastomotic healing. In bowel surgery, the part of bowel that will be anastomosed is often pedicled, leaving the blood supply dependent on the marginal artery only. Little is known about the blood supply in such a segment, and whether anastomotic strength is affected when flow would be reduced. This study describes oxygenation and blood flow in pedicled bowel segments in the rat and investigates whether early anastomotic strength changes with variations in blood flow. Methods: In rats, pedicled segments were created in ileum and colon by successive ligation of the feeding arteries. Oxygenation and blood flow were measured in the distal part of this segment by use of near-infrared spectroscopy with indocyanine green as an intravascular tracer. In a second experiment, a short pedicled colonic segment was created and, after flow measurements, an anastomosis was constructed. Wound strength and hydroxyproline content were analyzed 2 and 5 days after operation. Results: After creation of a pedicled segment, the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin decreased significantly. Blood flow also significantly decreased to even less than 10% of baseline. A very large variation was observed between animals, in particular, after ligation of the first arteries. The strength of colonic anastomoses was not significantly correlated with the blood flow in the pedicled segment before anastomotic construction. Conclusions: The creation of a pedicled bowel segment greatly reduces tissue oxygenation and blood flow to its distal part. Such impaired perioperative flow does not significantly affect early wound strength after anastomotic construction. {\textcopyright} 2009 The ASCRS.},

@article{truijen_cerebral_2018,
abstract = {Background and purpose: Cerebrovascular responses to head-of-bed positioning in patients with acute ischaemic stroke are heterogeneous, questioning the applicability of general recommendations on head positioning. Cerebral autoregulation is impaired to various extents after acute stroke, although it is unknown whether this affects cerebral perfusion during posture change. We aimed to elucidate whether the cerebrovascular response to head position manipulation depends on autoregulatory performance in patients with ischaemic stroke. Methods: The responses of bilateral transcranial Doppler ultrasound-determined cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) and local cerebral blood volume (CBV), assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy of total hemoglobin tissue concentration ([total Hb]), to head-of-bed lowering from 30° to 0° were determined in 39 patients with acute ischaemic stroke and 17 reference subjects from two centers. Cerebrovascular autoregulatory performance was expressed as the phase difference of the arterial pressure-to-CBFV transfer function. Results: Following head-of-bed lowering, CBV increased in the reference subjects only ([total Hb]: + 2.1 ± 2.0 vs. + 0.4 ± 2.6 $\mu$M; P < 0.05), whereas CBFV did not change in either group. CBV increased upon head-of-bed lowering in the hemispheres of patients with autoregulatory performance <50th percentile compared with a decrease in the hemispheres of patients with better autoregulatory performance ([total Hb]: +1.0 ± 1.3 vs. −0.5 ± 1.0 $\mu$M; P < 0.05). The CBV response was inversely related to autoregulatory performance (r = −0.68; P < 0.001) in the patients, whereas no such relation was observed for CBFV. Conclusion: This study is the first to provide evidence that cerebral autoregulatory performance in patients with acute ischaemic stroke affects the cerebrovascular response to changes in the position of the head.},

abstract = {This study investigated the influence of heat pre-conditioning on the recovery of muscle torque, microvascular function, movement economy and stride mechanics following exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD). Twenty male participants were equally assigned to a control (CON) and an experimental group (HEAT), and performed a 30-min downhill run (DHR) to elicit EIMD. HEAT group received three consecutive days of heat exposure (45.1 ± 3.2 min of hot water immersion at 42°C) prior to DHR. Microvascular function (near-infrared spectroscopy), maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) torque of the knee extensors, as well as two treadmill-based steady-state runs performed below (SSR-1) and above (SSR-2) the first ventilatory threshold) were assessed prior to DHR and repeated for four consecutive days post-DHR (D1-POST to D4-POST). The decline in MVC torque following EIMD was attenuated in HEAT compared with CON at D1-POST (p = 0.037), D3-POST (p = 0.002) and D4-POST (p = 0.022). Muscle soreness increased in both CON and HEAT, but was significantly attenuated in HEAT compared with CON at D2-POST (p = 0.024) and D3-POST (p = 0.013). Microvascular function decreased in CON from D1-POST to D3-POST (p = 0.009 to 0.018), and was lower compared with HEAT throughout D1-POST to D3-POST (p = 0.003 to 0.017). Pre-heat treatment decreased the magnitude of strength loss and muscle soreness, as well as attenuated the decline in microvascular function following EIMD. Heat treatment appears a promising pre-conditioning strategy when embarking on intensified training periods or competition.},

abstract = {Background. Since people with Parkinson disease (PD) rely on limited prefrontal executive resources for the control of gait, interventions targeting the prefrontal cortex (PFC) may help in managing PD-related gait impairments. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can be used to modulate PFC excitability and improve prefrontal cognitive functions and gait. Objective. We investigated the effects of adding anodal tDCS applied over the PFC to a session of aerobic exercise on gait, cognition, and PFC activity while walking in people with PD. Methods. A total of 20 people with PD participated in this randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled crossover study. Participants attended two 30-minute sessions of aerobic exercise (cycling at moderate intensity) combined with different tDCS conditions (active- or sham- tDCS), 1 week apart. The order of sessions was counterbalanced across the sample. Anodal tDCS (2 mA for 20 minutes [active-tDCS] or 10 s [sham-tDCS]) targeted the PFC in the most affected hemisphere. Spatiotemporal gait parameters, cognitive functions, and PFC activity while walking were assessed before and immediately after each session. Results. Compared with the pre-assessment, participants decreased step time variability (effect size: −0.4), shortened simple and choice reaction times (effect sizes: −0.73 and −0.57, respectively), and increased PFC activity in the stimulated hemisphere while walking (effect size: 0.54) only after aerobic exercise + active-tDCS. Conclusion. The addition of anodal tDCS over the PFC to a session of aerobic exercise led to immediate positive effects on gait variability, processing speed, and executive control of walking in people with PD.},

abstract = {Objective: Increase in arterial inflow to the lower limbs is important to obtain functional improvement in peripheral artery disease (PAD) patients with claudication. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of electrical stimulation of calf muscles on arterial inflow and tissue oxygen content in PAD in the area of stimulation. Methods: Fifteen adult patients [mean (standard deviation) age, 62 (12) years; height, 165 (8) cm; weight, 76 (13) kg; lowest ankle-brachial index 0.66 (0.19)] with stable arterial claudication were recruited. All patients performed a treadmill test (3.2 km/h, 10% slope) associated with a transcutaneous oximetry test expressed as decrease from rest of oxygen pressure (DROP) index values (calf changes minus chest changes from rest) with a maximum walking distance (median [25th/75th percentiles]) of 295 [133-881] m. The DROP index on the symptomatic side was -25 [-18/-34] mm Hg. On another day the patients underwent electrical stimulation in the seated position on the leg that was the most symptomatic on the treadmill. After resting values were recorded, the gastrocnemius was stimulated for 20 minutes at increasing contraction rates at 5-minute steps of 60, 75, 86, and 100 bpm on the most symptomatic side. Arterial blood inflow with duplex Doppler ultrasound scanning of the femoral artery, DROP transcutaneous oxygen pressure value, and oxygen concentration (O2Hb) from the near-infrared spectroscopic signal of the calf were recorded on both sides. Patients were instructed to report eventual contraction-induced pain in the stimulated calf. Results are given as mean (standard deviation) or median [25th/75th percentiles] according to distribution, and the level of statistical significance was set at P <.05 on two-tailed tests. Results: Lower limb inflow (mL/min) was 64 [48/86] vs 63 [57/81] (P >.05) before stimulation, 123 [75/156] vs 57 [44/92] (P <.01) at 60 bpm, 127 [91/207] vs 49 [43/68] (P <.01) at 75 bpm, 140 [84/200] vs 57 [45/71] (P <.01) at 86 bpm, and 154 [86/185] vs 55 [46/94] (P <.01) at 100 bpm on the stimulated vs nonstimulated limb, respectively. No apparent decrease or significant leg difference was observed in DROP index or O2Hb values. None of the patients reported contraction-induced pain in the leg. Conclusions: Electrical stimulation of calf muscle with the Veinoplus device results in a significant increase of arterial inflow without measurable muscle ischemia or pain. Potential use of this device as an adjuvant treatment to improve walking capacity in PAD patients remains to be evaluated. {\textcopyright} 2013 Society for Vascular Surgery.},

Several inbed rehabilitation methods exist, but we hypothesise that techniques that provoke muscle contractions are more effective than passive techniques. Methods: A randomised, controlled cross-over study will be carried out to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of early rehabilitation techniques on cardiac output (CO) in sedated patients in intensive care. 20 intubated and sedated patients will undergo 4 10 min rehabilitation sessions. 2 sessions will involve ‘passive' techniques based on mobilisations and inbed cycle ergometry and 2 involving electrostimulation of the quadriceps muscle and Functional Electrical Stimulation-cycling (FES-cycling). The primary outcome is CO measured by Doppler ultrasound. The secondary outcomes are right ventricular function, pulmonary systolic arterial pressure, muscle oxygenation and minute ventilation during exercise. Results and conclusion: Approval has been granted by our Institutional Review Board (Comit{\'{e}} de Protection des Personnes Nord-Ouest 3). The results of the trial will be presented at national and international meetings and published in peer-reviewed journals.},

abstract = {Inverse-dynamic models often use cost functions to solve the load-sharing problem. Although it is often assumed that energy is minimised, most cost functions are based on mechanically related measures like muscle force or stress. The aim of this study was to analyse the relationships of two cost functions with experimentally determined data on muscle energy consumption. Four subjects performed isometric contractions generating combinations of elbow flexion/extension and pro/supination moments. Muscle oxygen consumption (V̇O2) of the m. biceps breve, m. biceps longum, m. brachioradialis and m. triceps laterale was measured with near infrared spectroscopy. Both cost functions were implemented into an existing inverse-dynamic shoulder and elbow model and the individual cost values per muscle were calculated, normalised and subsequently compared to experimental V̇O2 values. The minimum stress cost function led to a good correspondence between V̇O2 and cost for the m. triceps laterale but for the flexor muscles cost was significantly lower. A newly proposed energy-related cost function showed, however, a far better correspondence. The inclusion of a linear term and muscle mass in the new criterion led model results to correspond better to experimental results. The energy-related cost function appeared to be a better measure for muscle energy consumption than the stress cost function and led to more realistic predictions of muscle activation. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Introduction: Oxygen consumption during prolonged cycling exercise has been extensively studied at different work rates and durations, but with the focus primarily on pulmonary oxygen consumption (pVO2). The purpose of this study was to use near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to investigate the relationship between pVO2 and local oxygenation responses in six active leg muscles during prolonged constant-load cycling at different intensities. Methods: 26 recreational male cyclists performed a constant-load high-intensity cycling test at 75% maximal aerobic power (MAP) for 30 min duration or until exhaustion. Of the 26 subjects, 14 performed a constant-load low-intensity cycling test for the same duration as well, at 50% of the work rate found to elicit blood lactate levels of 4 mmol∙l-1during incremental exercise. Pulmonary gas exchange (pVO2, RER, VE), heart rate, and NIRS measurements of the muscles vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), biceps femoris (BF), gluteus maximus (GMax), gastrocnemius lateralis (GL), and tibialis anterior (TA) were obtained continuously through both tests, while blood lactate and RPE was measured at specific time intervals. Results: Local oxygenation measurement for all the muscles collectively behaved in a similar manner as pVO2 at both intensities with an increase in O2 utilization only found in the initial phase, and additionally showed a surprisingly homogenous response. However, differences were found between the muscle groups with heterogeneity in regard to the amount of desaturation at low- and high-intensity. Discussion: Although the local responses were similar to each other and that of pVO2, differences were found between the muscles with heterogeneity in regard to the amount of saturation. The distal muscles TA and GL showed less difference in saturation between low-intensity and high-intensity than the more proximal muscles (VL, VM, BF, and GMax). Also the BF and GMax muscles were found to behave different with a lack of TSI steady-state during high-intensity. Conclusion: The use of NIRS might provide a noninvasive and direct way of measuring local oxygenation responses in muscles and provide an indication of the work contribution of various muscles during cycling exercise. Although local oxygenation responses across the muscles were in agreement with pVO2, difference in amount of saturation was found between muscle groups in the present study. Also peripheral differences were found between the subjects able to complete 30-min constant-load high-intensity cycling and those who did not.},

abstract = {Aims/hypothesis: Early compromised endothelial function challenges the ability of individuals with type 1 diabetes to perform normal physical exercise. The exact mechanisms underlying this vascular limitation remain unknown, but may involve either formation or metabolism of nitric oxide (NO), a major vasodilator, whose activity is known to be compromised by oxidative stress. Methods: Muscle microvascular reactivity (near-infrared spectroscopy) to an incremental exhaustive bout of exercise was assessed in 22 adults with uncomplicated type 1 diabetes (HbA1c 64.5 ± 15.7 mmol/mol; 8.0 ± 1.4%) and in 21 healthy individuals (18–40 years of age). NO-related substrates/metabolites were also measured in the blood along with other vasoactive compounds and oxidative stress markers; measurements were taken at rest, at peak exercise and after 15 min of recovery. Demographic characteristics, body composition, smoking status and diet were comparable in both groups. Results: Maximal oxygen uptake was impaired in individuals with type 1 diabetes compared with in healthy participants (35.6 ± 7.7 vs 39.6 ± 6.8 ml min−1 kg−1, p < 0.01) despite comparable levels of habitual physical activity (moderate to vigorous physical activity by accelerometery, 234.9 ± 160.0 vs 280.1 ± 114.9 min/week). Compared with non-diabetic participants, individuals with type 1 diabetes also displayed a blunted exercise-induced vasoreactivity (muscle blood volume at peak exercise as reflected by ∆ total haemoglobin, 2.03 ± 5.82 vs 5.33 ± 5.54 $\mu$mol/l; interaction ‘exercise' × ‘group', p < 0.05); this was accompanied by lower K+ concentration (p < 0.05), reduced plasma l-arginine (p < 0.05)—in particular when HbA1c was high (mean estimation: −4.0, p < 0.05)—and lower plasma urate levels (p < 0.01). Nonetheless, exhaustive exercise did not worsen lipid peroxidation or other oxidative stress biomarkers, and erythrocytic enzymatic antioxidant resources were mobilised to a comparable extent in both groups. Nitrite and total nitrosation products, which are potential alternative NO sources, were similarly unaltered. [Figure not available: see fulltext.] Conclusions/interpretation: Participants with uncomplicated type 1 diabetes displayed reduced availability of l-arginine, the essential substrate for enzymatic nitric oxide synthesis, as well as lower levels of the major plasma antioxidant, urate. Lower urate levels may reflect a defect in the activity of xanthine oxidase, an enzyme capable of producing NO from nitrite under hypoxic conditions. Thus, both canonical and non-canonical NO production may be reduced. However, neither of these changes exacerbated exercise-induced oxidative stress.

abstract = {Previous studies in children and older adults demonstrated faster oxygen uptake (VO2) kinetics in males compared with females, but young healthy adults have not been studied. We hypothesized that young men would have faster aerobic system dynamics in response to the onset of exercise than women. Interactions between oxygen supply and utilization were characterized by the dynamics of VO2, deoxyhemoglobin (HHb), tissue saturation index (TSI), cardiac output (Q{\textperiodcentered}), and calculated arteriovenous O2 difference (a-vO2diff) in women and men. Eighteen healthy active young women and men (9 of each sex) with similar aerobic fitness levels volunteered for this study. Participants performed an incremental cardiopulmonary treadmill exercise test and 3 moderate-intensity treadmill exercise tests (at 80% VO2 of gas exchange threshold). Data related to the moderate exercise were submitted to exponential data modelling to obtain parameters related to the aerobic system dynamics. The time constants of VO2, a-vO2diff, HHb, and TSI (30 ± 6, 29 ± 1, 16 ± 1, and 15 ± 2 s, respectively) in women were statistically (p < 0.05) faster than the time constants in men (42 ± 10, 49 ± 21, 19 ± 3, and 20 ± 4 s, respectively). Although Q{\textperiodcentered} dynamics were not statistically different (p = 0.06) between groups, there was a trend to slower Q{\textperiodcentered} dynamics in men corresponding with the slower VO2 kinetics. These results indicated that the peripheral and pulmonary oxygen extraction dynamics were remarkably faster in women. Thus, contrary to the hypothesis, VO2 dynamics measured at the mouth at the onset of submaximal treadmill walking were faster in women compared with men.},

abstract = {We analysed mean arterial blood pressure, cerebral blood flow velocity, oxygenated haemoglobin and deoxygenated haemoglobin signals to estimate dynamic cerebral autoregulation. We compared macrovascular (mean arterial blood pressure-cerebral blood flow velocity) and microvascular (oxygenated haemoglobin-deoxygenated haemoglobin) dynamic cerebral autoregulation estimates during three different conditions: rest, mild hypocapnia and hypercapnia. Microvascular dynamic cerebral autoregulation estimates were created by introducing the constant time lag plus constant phase shift model, which enables correction for transit time, blood flow and blood volume oscillations (TT-BF/BV correction). After TT-BF/BV correction, a significant agreement between mean arterial blood pressure-cerebral blood flow velocity and oxygenated haemoglobin-deoxygenated haemoglobin phase differences in the low frequency band was found during rest (left: intraclass correlation=0.6, median phase difference 29.5° vs. 30.7°, right: intraclass correlation=0.56, median phase difference 32.6° vs. 39.8°) and mild hypocapnia (left: intraclass correlation=0.73, median phase difference 48.6° vs. 43.3°, right: intraclass correlation=0.70, median phase difference 52.1° vs. 61.8°). During hypercapnia, the mean transit time decreased and blood volume oscillations became much more prominent, except for very low frequencies. The transit time related to blood flow oscillations was remarkably stable during all conditions. We conclude that non-invasive microvascular dynamic cerebral autoregulation estimates are similar to macrovascular dynamic cerebral autoregulation estimates, after TT-BF/BV correction is applied. These findings may increase the feasibility of non-invasive continuous autoregulation monitoring and guided therapy in clinical situations.},

abstract = {Older adults typically perform more poorly than younger adults in free recall memory tests. This age-related deficit has been linked to decline of brain activation and brain prefrontal lateralization, which may be the result of compensatory mechanisms. In the present pilot study, we investigated the effect of age on prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation during performance of a task that requires memory associations (temporal vs. spatial clustering), using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Ten younger adults, ten cognitively high-performing older individuals, and ten low-performing older individuals completed a free recall task, where either a temporal or spatial strategy (but not both simultaneously) could be employed to retrieve groups of same-category stimuli, whilst changes in PFC hemodynamics were recorded by means of a 12-channel fNIRS system. The results suggest PFC activation, and right lateralization specific to younger adults. Moreover, age did not affect use of memory organization, given that temporal clustering was preferred over spatial clustering in all groups. These findings are in line with previous literature on the aging brain and on temporal organization of memory. Our results also suggest that the PFC may be specifically involved in memory for temporal associations. Future research may consider whether age-related deficits in temporal organization may be an early sign of PFC pathology and possible neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {Cerebrovascular function and structure of the cortical cerebral microvessels are profoundly altered in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The functional hemodynamic consequences of such changes, however, remain essentially unknown. Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) potentially affect brain perfusion through either augmentation or inhibiti n of cerebral vasodilatation. This study investigated the cerebrovascular regulation during postural changes in AD before and after treatment with the ChEI galantamine. In 21 AD patients and 20 controls, blood pressure (BP - Finapres), frontal cortical oxygenation (near-infrared-spectroscopy), and cerebral blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (transcranial Doppler ultrasonography) were measured following a hypotensive challenge induced by postural change. In AD, measurements were repeated after 10 (SD 4) weeks of galantamine. Baseline cerebrovascular resistance was higher in AD (AD 2.83 (0.87) mmHg/cm/s, control 2.24 (1.3) mmHg/cm/s, p=0.010). 13 AD patients and 17 controls had a sufficiently large postural drop in BP (> 10 mmHg). AD patients had a larger postural decline in the frontal cortical concentration of total hemoglobin ($\Delta$ [tHb] AD=1.03 (0.70) $\mu$mol/l, control =0.30 (0.90) $\mu$mol/l, p=0.015). Moreover, the reduction in oxygenated hemoglobin was 57% larger in AD (p=0.085). Unexpectedly, the postural changes in BP were smaller in AD. Galantamine treatment affected neither orthostatic BP nor the decrease in [tHb]. In conclusion, even for moderate orthostatic hypotension during commonly occurring postural changes, cerebral cortical tissue perfusion declined more in AD, suggesting increased ischemic vulnerability of the brain. Galantamine neither improved nor impaired cerebrovascular regulation. {\textcopyright} 2010 - IOS Press and the authors.},

In the present study, a mathematical model is developed allowing calculation, together with steady-state levels of Ȯ2, of the kinetics of Ȯ2 readjustment in the muscle from the onset of ischemic but aerobic constant-load isotonic exercises. The model, which is based on the known sequence of exoergonic metabolic pathways involved in muscle energetics, allows simultaneous fitting of batched data obtained during exercises performed at different workloads. A Monte Carlo simulation has been carried out to test the quality of the model and to define the most appropriate experimental approach to obtain the best results. The use of a series of experimental protocols obtained at different levels of mechanical power, rather than repetitions of the same load, appears to be the most suitable procedure.},

abstract = {When interacting with technical systems, users experience mental workload. Particularly in multitasking scenarios (e.g., interacting with the car navigation system while driving) it is desired to not distract the users from their primary task. For such purposes, human-machine interfaces (HCIs) are desirable which continuously monitor the users' workload and dynamically adapt the behavior of the interface to the measured workload. While memory tasks have been shown to elicit hemodynamic responses in the brain when averaging over multiple trials, a robust single trial classification is a crucial prerequisite for the purpose of dynamically adapting HCIs to the workload of its user. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays an important role in the processing of memory and the associated workload. In this study of 10 subjects, we used functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), a non-invasive imaging modality, to sample workload activity in the PFC. The results show up to 78% accuracy for single-trial discrimination of three levels of workload from each other. We use an n-back task (n ∈ {1, 2, 3}) to induce different levels of workload, forcing subjects to continuously remember the last one, two, or three of rapidly changing items. Our experimental results show that measuring hemodynamic responses in the PFC with fNIRS, can be used to robustly quantify and classify mental workload. Single trial analysis is still a young field that suffers from a general lack of standards. To increase comparability of fNIRS methods and results, the data corpus for this study is made available online. {\textcopyright} 2014 Herff, Heger, Fortmann, Hennrich, Putze and Schultz.},

We hypothesized that, following 5 days of consecutive, resting, long-duration WIs, neuromuscular endurance performance would decrease. Methods: Fifteen well-trained, male subjects completed five consecutive 6-h resting WIs with 18-h surface intervals during the dive week while breathing compressed air at 1.35 ATA. Skeletal muscle endurance performance was assessed before and after each WI, and 24 and 72 h after the final WI. Muscular endurance assessments included 40% maximum handgrip endurance (MHE) and 50-repetition maximal isokinetic knee extensions. Near infrared spectroscopy was used to measure muscle oxidative capacity of the vastus lateralis and localized muscle tissue oxygenation of the vastus lateralis and flexor carpi radialis. Simultaneously, brachioradialis neuromuscular activation was measured by surface electromyography. Results: A 24.9% increase (p = 0.04) in the muscle oxidative capacity rate constant (k) occurred on WI 4 compared to baseline. No changes occurred in 40% MHE time to exhaustion or rate of fatigue or total work performed for the 50-repetition maximal isokinetic knee extension. The first quartile of deoxygenated hemoglobin concentration showed a 6 and 35% increase on WIs 3 and 5 (p = 0.026) with second quartile increases of 9 and 32% on WIs 3 and 5 (p = 0.049) during the 40% MHE testing when compared to WI 1.

abstract = {Background: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients exhibit a reduced exercise capacity that impacts quality of life. Dietary nitrate supplementation has been shown to have favorable effects on exercise capacity in disease populations by reducing the oxygen cost of exercise. This study investigated whether dietary nitrates would acutely improve exercise capacity in CKD patients. Methods and results: In this randomized, double-blinded crossover study, 12 Stage 3–4 CKD patients (Mean ± SEM: Age, 60 ± 5yrs; eGFR, 50.3 ± 4.6 ml/min/1.73 m2) received an acute dose of 12.6 mmol of dietary nitrate in the form of concentrated beetroot juice (BRJ) and a nitrate depleted placebo (PLA). Skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative function was assessed using near-infrared spectroscopy. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing was performed on a cycle ergometer, with intensity increased by 25 W every 3 min until volitional fatigue. Plasma nitric oxide (NO) metabolites (NOm; nitrate, nitrite, low molecular weight S-nitrosothiols, and metal bound NO) were determined by gas-phase chemiluminescence. Plasma NOm values were significantly increased following BRJ (BRJ vs. PLA: 1074.4 ± 120.4 $\mu$M vs. 28.4 ± 6.6 $\mu$M, p < 0.001). Total work performed (44.4 ± 10.6 vs 39.6 ± 9.9 kJ, p = 0.03) and total exercise time (674 ± 85 vs 627 ± 86s, p = 0.04) were significantly greater following BRJ. Oxygen consumption at the ventilatory threshold was also improved by BRJ (0.90 ± 0.08 vs. 0.74 ± 0.06 L/min, p = 0.04). These changes occurred in the absence of improved skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity (p = 0.52) and VO2peak (p = 0.35). Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that inorganic nitrate can acutely improve exercise capacity in CKD patients. The effects of chronic nitrate supplementation on CKD related exercise intolerance should be investigated in future studies.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate local muscle oxygen consumption (mVO2) during various protocols of isometric handgrip exercise. mVO2was measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during sustained, rhythmic, and intermittent isometric handgrip exercise. Whereas rhythmic handgrip exercise has the advantage that local muscle metabolism can be measured over the full range from low- to high-intensity work, the advantage of sustained handgrip exercise is that it is less prone to movement artifacts. Intermittent isometric handgrip exercise enables calculation of mVO2 at short time intervals providing information about the time response of local oxygen consumption in relation to the onset of exercise. Ten healthy subjects participated in this study. The different protocols were performed on separate days and in random order. mVO2 during rhythmic exercise was significantly higher than that during sustained exercise at all work intensities tested (P ≤ 0.05). However, the highest oxygen consumption value for the three exercise protocols was measured during the steady state of intermittent exercise (P ≤ 0.05). These results show that the measurement of task-specific muscle metabolism during exercise can be measured noninvasively and with relative ease by near-infrared spectroscopy. {\textcopyright} (2003) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

abstract = {Motor-cognitive dual tasks have been intensely studied and it has been demonstrated that even well practiced movements like walking show signs of interference when performed concurrently with a challenging cognitive task. Typically walking speed is reduced, at least in elderly persons. In contrast to these findings, some authors report an increased movement frequency under dual-task conditions, which they call hastening. A tentative explanation has been proposed, assuming that the respective movements are governed by an automatic control regime. Though, under single-task conditions, these automatic processes are supervised by "higher-order" cognitive control processes. However, when a concurrent cognitive task binds all cognitive resources, the automatic process is freed from the detrimental effect of cognitive surveillance, allowing higher movement frequencies. Fast rhythmic movements (> 1 Hz) should more likely be governed by such an automatic process than low frequency discrete repetitive movements. Fifteen subjects performed two repetitive movements under single and dual-task condition, that is, in combination with a mental calculation task. According to the expectations derived from the explanatory concept, we found an increased movement frequency under dual-task conditions only for the fast rhythmic movement (paddleball task) but not for the slower discrete repetitive task (pegboard task). fNIRS measurements of prefrontal cortical load confirmed the idea of an automatic processing in the paddleball task, whereas the pegboard task seems to be more controlled by processes interfering with the calculation related processing.},

abstract = {Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) results in a failure to adequately supply blood and oxygen (O2) to working tissues and presents as claudication pain during walking. Nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability is essential for vascular health and function. Plasma nitrite (NO2-) is a marker of vascular NO production but may also be a protected circulating "source" that can be converted to NO during hypoxic conditions, possibly aiding perfusion. We hypothesized that dietary supplementation of inorganic nitrate in the form of beetroot (BR) juice would increase plasma NO2- concentration, increase exercise tolerance, and decrease gastrocnemius fractional O2 extraction, compared with placebo (PL). This was a randomized, open-label, crossover study. At each visit, subjects (n = 8) underwent resting blood draws, followed by consumption of 500 ml BR or PL and subsequent blood draws prior to, during, and following a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise (CPX) test. Gastrocnemius oxygenation during the CPX was measured by near-infrared spectroscopy. There were no changes from rest for [NO2-] (152 ± 72 nM) following PL. BR increased plasma [NO2-] after 3 h (943 ± 826 nM; P ≤ 0.01). Subjects walked 18% longer before the onset of claudication pain (183 ± 84 s vs. 215 ± 99 s; P ≤ 0.01) and had a 17% longer peak walking time (467 ± 223 s vs. 533 ± 233 s; P ≤ 0.05) following BR vs. PL. Gastrocnemius tissue fractional O2 extraction was lower during exercise following BR (7.3 ± 6.2 vs. 10.4 ±6.1 arbitrary units; P ≤ 0.01). Diastolic blood pressure was lower in the BR group at rest and during CPX testing (P ≤ 0.05). These findings support the hypothesis that NO2--related NO signaling increases peripheral tissue oxygenation in areas of hypoxia and increases exercise tolerance in PAD.

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to assess if chronic low back pain patients have impaired paraspinal muscle O2 turnover and endurance capacity as compared to healthy control subjects during dynamic exercise. Middle-aged healthy male subjects (n = 12, control) and male patients with chronic low back pain (n = 17, CLBP) participated in the study. L4-L5 level paraspinal muscle fatigue was objectively assessed during earlier validated 90 s dynamic back endurance test (spectral EMG, MPFslope). Also EMG amplitude (EMG amplitude) and initial MPF (MPFinitial) were assessed from the initial 5 s of the endurance contraction. Simultaneously near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used for quantitative measurement of local L4-L5 paraspinal muscle O2 consumption. Subcutaneous tissue thickness (ATT) was measured from the EMG and NIRS recording sites. The results indicated that control and CLBP groups were compatible as regarding anthropometric variables, paraspinal muscle activation levels (EMGamplitude), initial MPF (MPFinitial) and ATT. When the ATT was used as a covariate in the ANOVA analysis, CLBP group did not show significantly greater paraspinal muscle fatigability (right MPFslope - 12.2 ± 10.7%/min, left right MPFslope - 12.6 ± 13.3%/min) or O2 consumption (right NIRSslope - 52.8 ± 79.6 $\mu$M/l/s) as compared to healthy controls (right MPFslope - 11.9 ± 7.6%/min, left MPFslope - 12.7 ± 8.6%/min, right NIRSslope - 53.7 ± 95.2 $\mu$M/l/s). As a conclusion, these CLBP male patients did not show any impaired rate of paraspinal muscle oxygen consumption or excessive paraspinal muscle fatigability during dynamic exercise as compared with healthy controls. Subcutaneous tissue thickness has a strong influence on the NIRS and EMG amplitude measurements and, if unchecked, it could result in the false interpretation of the results. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Walking, although a largely automatic process, is controlled by the cortex and the spinal cord with corrective reflexes modulated through integration of neural signals from central and peripheral inputs at supraspinal level throughout the gait cycle. In this study we used an additional cognitive task to interfere with the automatic processing during walking in order to explore the neural mechanisms involved in healthy young adults. Participants were asked to walk on a treadmill at two speeds, both with and without additional cognitive load. We evaluated the impact of speed and cognitive load by analyzing activity of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) alongside spinal cord reflex activity measured by soleus H-reflex amplitude and gait changes obtained by using an inertial measuring unit. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed that fNIRS Oxy-Hb concentrations signiflcantly increased in the PFC with dual task (walking while performing a cognitive task) compared to a single task (walking only; p < 0.05). PFC activity was unaffected by increases of walking speed. H-reflex amplitude and gait variables did not change in response to either dual task or increases in walking speed. When walking under additional cognitive load participants adapted by using greater activity in the PFC, but this adaptation did not detrimentally affect H-reflex amplitude or gait variables. Our findings suggest that in a healthy young population central mechanisms (PFC) are activated in response to cognitive loads but that H-reflex activity and gait performance can successfully be maintained.This study provides insights into the mechanisms behind healthy individuals safely performing dual task walking. {\textcopyright} 2014 Meester, Al-Yahya, Dawes, Martin-Fagg and Pi{\~{n}}on.},

We analysed recorded signals using analysis methods based on wavelet transform (WT) for the wide frequency range from 0.0095 to 2 Hz. Despite the fact that both devices use a similar radiation source both signals are distinct from each other. We found statistically significant differences for WT amplitude spectra between both signals. Additionally, we showed different relationships of both signals to blood pressure. Collectively, based on the present findings and those of previous studies, we can conclude that the combination of NIR-T/BSS or NIRS signals and time–frequency analysis opens new frontiers in science, and give possibility to understand and diagnosis of various neurodegenerative and ageing related diseases to improve diagnostic procedures and patient prognosis.},

Using a randomized, counterbalanced, double-blind Latin-square design, 14 competitive female cyclists (age: 31 6 7 years; height: 1.69 ± 0.07 m; body mass: 61.6 ± 6.0 kg) completed four 20-km time trials on a racing bicycle fitted to a turbo trainer. Approximately 2.5 hours before each trial, subjects consumed a 70-ml dose of concentrated beetroot juice containing either 0.45 g of dietary nitrate or with the nitrate content removed (placebo). One hour before each trial, subjects consumed a capsule containing either 5 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg-1 of caffeine or maltodextrin (placebo). There was a significant effect of supplementation on power output (p = 0.001), with post hoc tests revealing higher power outputs in caffeine (205 ± 21 W) vs. nitrate (194 ± 22 W) and placebo (194 ± 25 W) trials only. Caffeine-induced improvements in power output corresponded with significantly higher measures of heart rate (caffeine: 166 ±12 b{\textperiodcentered}min-1 vs. placebo: 159 ± 15 b{\textperiodcentered}min21; p = 0.02), blood lactate (caffeine: 6.54 ± 2.40 mmol{\textperiodcentered};L-1 vs. placebo: 4.50 6 2.11 mmol{\textperiodcentered}L-1; p , 0.001), and respiratory exchange ratio (caffeine: 0.95 ± 0.04 vs. placebo: 0.91 ± 0.05; p = 0.03). There were no effects (p ≥ 0.05) of supplementation on cycling cadence, rating of perceived exertion, VO2, or integrated electromyographic activity. The results of this study support the well-established beneficial effects of caffeine supplementation on endurance performance. In contrast, acute supplementation with dietary nitrate seems to have no effect on endurance performance and adds nothing to the benefits afforded by caffeine supplementation.},

abstract = {Background: Walking abnormalities in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) are characterized by a shift in locomotor control from healthy automaticity to compensatory prefrontal executive control. Indirect measures of automaticity of walking (eg, step-to-step variability and dual-task cost) suggest that freezing of gait (FoG) may be associated with reduced automaticity of walking. However, the influence of FoG status on actual prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity during walking remains unclear. Objective: To investigate the influence of FoG status on automaticity of walking in people with PD. Methods: Forty-seven people with PD were distributed into 2 groups based on FoG status, which was assessed by the New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire: PD−FoG (n = 23; UPDRS-III = 35) and PD+FoG (n = 24; UPDRS-III = 43.1). Participants walked over a 9-m straight path (with a 180° turn at each end) for 80 seconds. Two conditions were tested off medication: single- and dual-task walking (ie, with a concomitant cognitive task). A portable functional near-infrared spectroscopy system recorded PFC activity while walking (including turns). Wearable inertial sensors were used to calculate spatiotemporal gait parameters. Results: PD+FoG had greater PFC activation during both single and dual-task walking than PD−FoG (P =.031). There were no differences in gait between PD−FoG and PD+FoG. Both groups decreased gait speed (P =.029) and stride length (P <.001) during dual-task walking compared with single-task walking. Conclusions: These findings suggest that PD+FoG have reduced automaticity of walking, even in absence of FoG episodes. PFC activity while walking seems to be more sensitive than gait measures in identifying reduction in automaticity of walking in PD+FoG.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The long-term clinical and physiological consequences of COVID-19 infection remain unclear. While fatigue has emerged as a common symptom following infection, little is known about its links with autonomic dysfunction. SARS-CoV-2 is known to infect endothelial cells in acute infection, resulting in autonomic dysfunction. Here we set out to test the hypothesis that this results in persistent autonomic dysfunction and is associated with post-COVID fatigue in convalescent patients. METHODS We recruited 20 fatigued and 20 non-fatigued post-COVID patients (median age 44.5 years, 36/40 (90%) female, median time to follow up 166.5 days). Fatigue was assessed using the Chalder Fatigue Scale. These underwent the Ewing's autonomic function test battery, including deep breathing, active standing, Valsalva manoeuvre and cold-pressor testing, with continuous electrocardiogram and blood pressure monitoring, as well as near-infrared spectroscopy-based cerebral oxygenation. 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was also conducted, and patients completed the generalised anxiety disorder-7 questionnaire. We assessed between-group differences in autonomic function test results and used unadjusted and adjusted linear regression to investigate the relationship between fatigue, anxiety, and autonomic test results. RESULTS We found no pathological differences between fatigued and non-fatigued patients on autonomic testing or on 24-hour blood pressure monitoring. Symptoms of orthostatic intolerance were reported by 70% of the fatigued cohort at the time of active standing, with no associated physiological abnormality detected. Fatigue was strongly associated with increased anxiety (p <0.001), with no patients having a pre-existing diagnosis of anxiety. CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate the significant burden of fatigue, symptoms of autonomic dysfunction and anxiety in the aftermath of COVID-19 infection, but reassuringly do not demonstrate pathological findings on autonomic testing.},

abstract = {Purpose It is still equivocal whether oxygen uptake recovery kinetics are limited by oxygen delivery and can be improved by supplementary oxygen. The present study aimed to investigate whether measurements of muscle and pulmonary oxygen uptake kinetics can be used to assess oxygen delivery limitations in healthy subjects. Methods Sixteen healthy young adults performed three sub-maximal exercise tests (6 min at 40% Wmax) under hypoxic (14%O2), normoxic (21%O2) and hyperoxic (35%O2) conditions on separate days in randomized order. Both Pulmonary VO2 and near infra red spectroscopy (NIRS) based Tissue Saturation Index (TSI) offset kinetics were calculated using mono-exponential curve fitting models. Results Time constant $\tau$ of VO2 offset kinetics under hypoxic (44.9 ± 7.3s) conditions were significantly larger than $\tau$ of the offset kinetics under normoxia (37.9 ± 8.2s, p = 0.02) and hyperoxia (37±6s, p = 0.04). TSI mean response time (MRT) of the offset kinetics under hypoxic conditions (25.5 ± 13s) was significantly slower than under normoxic (15 ± 7.7, p = 0.007) and hyperoxic (13 ± 7.3, p = 0.008) conditions. Conclusion The present study shows that there was no improvement in the oxygen uptake and muscle oxygenation recovery kinetics in healthy subjects under hyperoxic conditions. Slower TSI and VO2 recovery kinetics under hypoxic conditions indicate that both NIRS and spiro-ergometry are appropriate non-invasive measurement tools to assess the physiological response of a healthy individual to hypoxic exercise.},

Here we reported the association analysis between psychophysical phenotypes and genome-wide gene expression changes in human adaptation to one of the most extreme climates on Earth, the Antarctic Dome Argus. Dome A is the highest ice feature in Antarctica, and may be the coldest, driest and windiest location on earth. It is considered unapproachable due to its hostile environment. In 2007, a Chinese team of 17 male explorers made the expedition to Dome A for scientific investigation. Overall, 133 psychophysical phenotypes were recorded, and genome-wide gene expression profiles from the blood samples of the explorers were measured before their departure and upon their arrival at Dome A. We found that mood disturbances, including tension (anxiety), depression, anger and fatigue, had a strong, positive, linear relationship with the level of a male sex hormone, testosterone, using the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) analysis. We also demonstrated that significantly lowest-level Gene Ontology groups in changes of gene expression in blood cells with erythrocyte removal were consistent with the adaptation of the psychophysical characteristics. Interestingly, we discovered a list of genes that were strongly related to significant phenotypes using phenotype and gene expression PCC analysis. Importantly, among the 70 genes that were identified, most were significantly related to mood disturbances, where 42 genes have been reported in the literature mining, suggesting that the other 28 genes were likely novel genes involved in the mood disturbance mechanism. Taken together, our association analysis provides a reliable method to uncover novel genes and mechanisms related to phenotypes, although further studies are needed.},

Developed for cortical brain mapping, fNIRS technology has relevance in other organs where pathology affects the microcirculation. We describe fNIRS of the human bladder for evaluation of hemodynamic change during voiding. A 5×5-cm grid with two source-detector pairs is placed on the abdomen suprapubically in an asymptomatic male. In four separate trials, after natural bladder filling NIRS-derived changes in oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb), deoxyhemoglobin (HHb), and total hemoglobin (tHb) concentration are recorded during voiding (measured via uroflow), using four channels of a four wavelength continuous wave instrument. Graphic and video images (topographic mapping software) are generated. Changes in tHb occur following permission to void that predominantly reflected variation in O2Hb; tHb peaks at maximum urine flow then falls to a nadir lasting to uroflow end. Change in fNIRS video color intensity correlates with graphic change in chromophore concentration. Color variations across the mapped area suggest regional hemodynamic variation. fNIRS bladder studies generate reproducible chromophore data consistent with single channel studies, but the dynamic color video and larger tissue area monitored potentially offer new methodology for investigating regional variations in bladder oxygenation and hemodynamics. {\textcopyright} 2009 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.},

In accordance with recent evidence supporting the role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in exercise maintenance, this double-blind sham-controlled crossover study (N = 22) compared the effect of high definition (HD)-tDCS of the PMC or the PFC on endurance time of a sustained contraction task of the elbow flexor. Brain activity was monitored using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to measure the neurovascular response elicited by HD-tDCS. Electromyography (EMG) and force obtained during maximal voluntary and evoked contractions were assessed before and after the contraction task to explore the effect of brain stimulation on peripheral and central fatigue. While the stimulation affected the brain response in the PFC during the contraction task, no effects of the stimulation were observed on endurance time or fatigue indices. These results are discussed in relation to the neurocognitive models of physical effort.},

abstract = {Background: Clinicians typically rely on neuropsychological and balance tests to track concussion recovery. The aforementioned tests imply impairments that are based on performance, but these tests do not directly measure brain physiology throughout concussion recovery. Because of these issues, an objective biomarker that can index severity and the recovery timeline is needed. Moreover, the number of concussions occurring at a recreational level requires the biomarker to be easily administered in a cost effective manner, and the results easily interpreted. Methods: To address these issues, near-infrared spectroscopy was used to assess the relative changes in oxy (HbO2)- and deoxyhaemoglobin and the associated standard deviations (SD) in the prefrontal cortex. Resting haemoglobin, and haemoglobin changes in response to hypercapnia (five repeated 20s breath holds), was measured in all participants. Data were aggregated into healthy baselines (n = 115), and concussed participants on days 1–3 (n = 14), 4–6 (n = 8), and 7–14 (n = 11). The data were statistically compared using a 1 × 4 ANOVA. Results: Resting HbO2 values progressively lowered from days 1–3 to 7–14 (with no differences compared to controls). The second major finding showed that hypercapnic HbO2 SD was significantly lower than resting values on days 1–3 and 4–6, but reversed back towards the healthy control group on day 7–14. Conclusion: Monitoring cerebral oxygenation changes is a viable biomarker to assess the physiological state of the brain following concussion.},

abstract = {New Findings: What is the central question of this study? What is the effect of acute NO precursor intake on vascular function, muscle and cerebral oxygenation and peripheral and central neuromuscular fatigue during knee-extension exercise? What is the main finding and its importance? Acute NO precursor ingestion increases the plasma concentrations of NO precursors (nitrate, arginine and citrulline) and enhances post-ischaemic vasodilatation, but has no significant effect on muscle and cerebral oxygenation, peripheral and central mechanisms of neuromuscular fatigue and, consequently, does not improve exercise performance. Abstract: Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in matching blood flow to oxygen demand in the brain and contracting muscles during exercise. Previous studies have shown that increasing NO bioavailability can improve muscle function. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of acute NO precursor intake on muscle and cerebral oxygenation and on peripheral and central neuromuscular fatigue during exercise. In four experimental sessions, 15 healthy men performed a thigh ischaemia–reperfusion test followed by submaximal isometric knee extensions (5 s on–4 s off; 45% of maximal voluntary contraction) until task failure. In each session, subjects drank a nitrate-rich beetroot juice containing 520 mg nitrate (N), N and citrulline (6 g; N+C), N and arginine (6 g; N+A) or a placebo (PLA). Prefrontal cortex and quadriceps near-infrared spectroscopy parameters were monitored continuously. Transcranial magnetic stimulation and femoral nerve electrical stimulation were used to assess central and peripheral determinants of fatigue. The post-ischaemic increase in thigh blood total haemoglobin concentration was larger in N (10.1 ± 3.7 mmol) and N+C (10.9 ± 3.3 mmol) compared with PLA (8.2 ± 2.7 mmol; P < 0.05). Nitric oxide precursors had no significant effect on muscle and cerebral oxygenation or on peripheral and central mechanisms of neuromuscular fatigue during exercise. The total number of knee extensions did not differ between sessions (N, 71.9 ± 33.2; N+A, 73.3 ± 39.4; N+C, 74.6 ± 34.0; PLA, 71.8 ± 39.9; P > 0.05). In contrast to the post-ischaemic hyperaemic response, NO bioavailability in healthy subjects might not be the limiting factor for tissue perfusion and oxygenation during submaximal knee extensions to task failure.},

abstract = {Purpose: Orthostatic hypotension, leading to cerebral hypoperfusion, can result in postural instability and falls in older adults. We determined the efficacy of a novel, intermittent pneumatic compression system, applying pressure around the lower legs, as a countermeasure against orthostatic stress in older adults. Methods: Data were collected from 13 adults (4 male) over 65 years of age. Non-invasive ultrasound measured middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv) and finger photoplethysmography measured mean arterial blood pressure (MAP). Intermittent lower leg compression was applied in a peristaltic manner in the local diastolic phase of each cardiac cycle to optimize venous return during 1-min of seated rest and during a sit-to-stand transition to 1-min of quiet standing with compression initiated 15 s before transition. Results: During seated rest, compression resulted in a 4.5 ± 6.5 mmHg increase in MAP, and 2.3 ± 2.1 cm/s increase in MCAv (p < 0.05). MAP and MCAv increased during the 15 s of applied compression before the posture transition (2.3 ± 7.2 mmHg and 2.1 ± 4.0 cm/s, respectively, p < 0.05) with main effects for both variables confirming continued benefit during the transition and quiet stand periods. Conclusions: Application of carefully timed, intermittent compression to the lower legs of older adults increased MAP and MCAv during seated rest and maintained an elevated MAP and MCAv during a transition to standing posture. Future research could assess the benefits of this technology for persons at risk for orthostatic hypotension on standing and while walking in an effort to reduce injurious, unexplained falls in older adults.},

abstract = {Background Takayasu arteritis (TAK) is a rare chronic inflammatory vasculitis predominantly affecting the aorta and its main branches. Takayasu arteritis has been shown to increase cardiovascular risk. Supervised exercise training (SET) is a well-recognized and effective therapeutic tool improving walking performances in patients with chronic atherosclerotic disease; however, the effects of SET, and the underlying mechanisms, remain poorly documented in TAK patients. Case summary We reviewed the literature and investigated the effects of a 12-week SET programme on walking performances, physical function, and calf muscle oxygen saturation (StO2; assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy) during exercise in a 28-year-old man with TAK and symptoms of arterial lower limb claudication. The literature review evidences only two recent publications suggesting that exercise training is effective and well-tolerated in patients with arteritis. The treadmill pain-free (þ22%) and maximal (þ273%) walking distance, 6-min walking distance (þ66%), and physical function of lower extremities (þ20%) following SET were significantly improved in our patient. Moreover, we observed a greater muscle oxygen desaturation (increased oxygen extraction) during exercise. Discussion Following SET, the increased oxygen extraction may be related to improved microvascular milieu leading to a better match between muscle oxygen supply and demand during exercise. These new results may contribute to mechanistic insights in peripheral adaptations following exercise training in TAK patients and may help to explain, at least partly, the increased walking performances. Although more studies are needed to better explore the impact of exercise training, these results suggest that exercise should be recommended in TAK patients.},

abstract = {Aims: Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive, easy to apply, optical technology for measuring cerebral blood oxygenation, but there is lack of comprehensive population data to aid interpretation and clinical use. Given the importance of cerebral perfusion in the context of evolving guideline recommendations for more aggressive lowering of blood pressure (BP) in hypertension, even in the oldest old, understanding of normative NIRS values is timely. We estimated normative values of cerebral oxygenation measured by NIRS in a large community-dwelling population sample of adults aged > = 50 years (n = 3110). We hypothesized that measurements would be attenuated by cardiovascular risk factors. Methods: Data from Wave 3 of The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) was utilized. Frontal lobe cerebral oxygenation was continuously measured via a Portalite, while participants rested in the supine position. Beat-to-beat BP was measured simultaneously. Normative data was modelled using generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS). Multivariate linear regressions were used to examine associations with cardiovascular risk factors. Results: All three measures of NIRS (TSI, O2Hb and HHb) declined with increasing age. O2Hb and HHb were significantly lower in males than females. Increased smoking, excess alcohol intake, a higher waist-hip ratio, diabetes, angina, congestive heart failure, transient ischemic attack and total cardiovascular disease burden were all associated with decreased cerebral oxygenation. Conclusion: We present for the first time, normative resting-state NIRS reference data from a large population, which contributes to clinical interpretation of NIRS and advances the use of NIRS as a standard clinical tool.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) uses light to monitor changes in the concentration of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin in living tissue non-invasively and in real time. Applications of NIRS in urology research and the strengths and limitations of this technology are reviewed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A Medline and Pub-Med search using "spectroscopy" with heading terms: near infrared (NIR), near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), urology, kidney, renal, urinary tract, bladder, prostate, testis and penis. RESULTS: Research incorporating NIRS has investigated a range of urologic conditions where a hemodynamic or vascular etiology is thought to be the underlying pathophysiology: as an aid to diagnosis in cryptorchidism, testicular torsion and vasculogenic erectile dysfunction; to evaluate renal metabolism and bladder dysfunction, and to study skeletal muscle metabolism in end stage renal disease. Strengths and limitations of NIRS relate primarily to the basic physics of how light in the NIR spectrum penetrates tissue and is scattered and absorbed. CONCLUSIONS: NIRS is a non-invasive, portable, real time measure of changes in tissue perfusion and oxygenation. In urology NIRS appears particularly applicable in ischemic conditions, and the evaluation of disorders associated with alterations in regional tissue hemodynamics (local changes in pressure, muscle contraction and urinary tract obstruction). Because the bladder detrusor can be interrogated transcutaneously NIRS may also provide a non-invasive means of evaluating patients with voiding dysfunction. Studies to date warrant further research and specific refinement of instrumentation and algorithm software for urologic applications, as NIRS could provide urologists with new methods of non-invasive physiologic diagnostic evaluation.},

abstract = {Introduction Feelings of fatigue are reduced after a session of continuous exercise of low-to-moderate intensity lasting 20 min or more, but only when feelings of energy are increased. Feelings of fatigue and energy have not been described after fatiguing, high-intensity interval exercise. Cerebral oxygenation has been implicated as a central correlate of fatigability, but it has not been studied concurrent with perceived fatigue during or after exercise. Methods Fifteen recreationally active participants (8 women, 7 men) completed bouts of sprint interval cycling (four, 30-s all-out sprints each followed by 4 min of active recovery) and a time- and work-matched bout of constant resistance cycling. Oxygenation (oxygenated hemoglobin [HbO2]) and deoxygenation (deoxygenated hemoglobin [HHb]) in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were measured using near-infrared spectroscopy. Fatigue ratings during each sprint and feelings of fatigue and energy during recovery were assessed. Results Increases in HbO2 and HHb in frontal cortex were greater during sprint cycling than during constant resistance cycling (P = 0.001). Fatigability (decreased power output) increased over successive sprints (P = 0.001). About 95% of the increase in fatigue ratings across sprints (P < 0.001) was accounted for by fatigability and cortical HbO2. Feelings of fatigue were decreased (P < 0.001) and feelings of energy were increased (P < 0.05) across sprint recovery periods but were unchanged during constant resistance cycling. About 85% of the changes in feelings of fatigue or energy during recovery were explained by fatigue ratings across sprints and maximum HbO2 in the cortex during recovery. Conclusion Repeated, high-intensity sprints were fatiguing, but paradoxical reductions in feelings of fatigue and increases in feelings of energy occurred during recovery that were accounted for by ratings of fatigue during exercise and oxygenation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during recovery.},

abstract = {Estimation of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO 2) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) is important to investigate the neurovascular coupling and physiological components in blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals quantitatively. Although there are methods that can determine CMRO 2 changes using functional MRI (fMRI) or near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), current approaches require a separate hypercapnia calibration process and have the potential to incur bias in many assumed model parameters. In this paper, a novel method to estimate CMRO 2 without hypercapnia is described using simultaneous measurements of NIRS and fMRI. Specifically, an optimization framework is proposed that minimizes the differences between the two forms of the relative CMRO 2-CBF coupling ratio from BOLD and NIRS biophysical models, from which hypercapnia calibration and model parameters are readily estimated. Based on the new methods, we found that group average CBF, CMRO 2, cerebral blood volume (CBV), and BOLD changes within activation of the primary motor cortex during a finger tapping task increased by 39.5 ± 21.4%, 18.4 ± 8.7%, 12.9 ± 6.7%, and 0.5 ± 0.2%, respectively. The group average estimated flow-metabolism coupling ratio was 2.38 ± 0.65 and the hypercapnia parameter was 7.7 ± 1.7%. These values are within the range of values reported from other literatures. Furthermore, the activation maps from CBF and CMRO 2 were well localized on the primary motor cortex, which is the main target region of the finger tapping task. {\textcopyright} 2010 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

Methods: This was a monocentric, randomized, controlled crossover study. Patients with severe to very severe COPD carried out two high-intensity constant work-rate exercise tests (CWRET) with and without NHF on two consecutive days. The primary outcome was the mean difference in endurance time between both conditions. The secondary aims included vastus lateralis oxygenation (StO2), dyspnoea, leg discomfort, maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), transcutaneous CO2 pressure (PtcCO2), respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR) and pulsed O2 saturation (SpO2), as well as the patients' opinions of the device. Results: A total of 19 patients were included (mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s = 28.7 ± 10.8%, age = 62.1 ± 9.1 years). No significant differences in endurance time during the CWRET were found between the two test conditions (−66.58 (95% CI: −155.9 to 22.7) s, P = 0.12).

abstract = {PURPOSE: We investigated the knee-extensor torque at which reoxygenation (inflow of arterial blood) during an isometric contraction stopped, whether this torque depended on maximal torque capacity (MTC), and whether there were differences among the synergists. METHODS: Isometric knee-extension torque was measured using a dynamometer with 90°angles in the hip and knee. Maximal voluntary activation (established with superimposed nerve stimulation) was > 90% in the 15 healthy male subjects (20-30 yr). Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to measure changes in muscle oxygenation of the vastus medialis (VM), vastus lateralis (VL), and rectus femoris (RF) muscle during submaximal isometric contractions at intensities of 20-45% MTC with 5% increments, applied in randomized order and divided over 2 d. At each torque, a contraction with an inflated pressure cuff (450 mm Hg), inducing full arterial occlusion, was followed (10 min of rest) by a second contraction without the cuff. RESULTS: MTC ranged from 178 to 348 N{\textperiodcentered}m. The torque at which maximal deoxygenation (all oxygen consumed) during contraction without the cuff became similar (P < 0.05) to the maximal deoxygenation reached with the cuff (indicative for complete occlusion of blood flow during the contraction without the cuff) was significantly higher for the RF (35% MTC) than for both vasti (25% MTC). There was no significant relation between MTC and relative (% MTC) torque at which muscle reoxygenation stopped. CONCLUSION: Knee-extensor reoxygenation stopped at lower torques than previously reported for blood flow in this muscle, and this occurred at the same % MTC in subjects of different strength but at different % MTC for the different synergists. {\textcopyright}2007The American College of Sports Medicine.},

abstract = {Purpose: To examine physiological responses to submaximal field running with changes of direction (COD), and to compare two approaches to assess running economy (RE) with COD, ie, during square-wave (SW) and incremental (INC) exercises. Methods: Ten male team-sport athletes performed, in straight-line or over 20 m shuttles, one maximal INC and four submaximal SW (45, 60, 75 and 90% of the velocity associated with maximal pulmonary O2 uptake [vVO 2pmax]). Pulmonary (VO2p) and gastrocnemius (VO 2m) O2 uptake were computed for all tests. For both running mode, RE was estimated as the O2 cost per kilogram of bodyweight, per meter of running during all SW and INC. Results: Compared with straight-line runs, shuttle runs were associated with higher VO2p (eg, 33 ± 6 vs 37 ± 5 mL O2{\textperiodcentered}min -1{\textperiodcentered}kg-1 at 60%, P <.01) and VO2m (eg, 1.1 ± 0.5 vs 1.3 ± 0.8 mL O2{\textperiodcentered}min -1{\textperiodcentered}100 g-1 at 60%, P = .18, Cohen's d = 0.32). With COD, RE was impaired during SW (0.26 ± 0.02 vs 0.24 ± 0.03 mL O2{\textperiodcentered}kg-1{\textperiodcentered}m-1, P <.01) and INC (0.23 ± 0.04 vs 0.16 ± 0.03 mL O2{\textperiodcentered}kg -1{\textperiodcentered}m-1, P < .001). For both SW and INC tests, the changes in RE with COD were related to height (eg, r = .56 [90%CL, 0.01;0.85] for SW) and weekly training/competitive volume (eg, r = -0.58 [-0.86;-0.04] for SW). For both running modes, RE calculated from INC was better than that from SW (both P <.001). Conclusion: Although RE is impaired during field running with COD, team-sport players of shorter stature and/or presenting greater training/competitive volumes may present a lower RE deterioration with COD. Present results do not support the use of INC to assess RE in the field, irrespective of running mode. {\textcopyright} 2011 Human Kinetics, Inc.},

The CLET were performed with HFNC and with nasal cannula (NC) in random order. The hemodynamics parameters of subjects during exercises were measured by a bioelectrical impedance device. The tissue oxygenation status (oxygenated hemoglobin, deoxygenated hemoglobin (hHb), total hemoglobin) was measured by a near infrared spectrophotometer. Results: The exercise duration was longer for HFNC test than NC test (962.9 ± 281.7 s, vs 823.9 ± 184.9 s, p < 0.05). At the end of CLET, the PetCO2 was lower for HFNC than NC (29.3 ± 5.1 mmHg vs 32.1 ± 5.5 mmHg, p < 0.05). There was no difference in cardiac output (NC: 7.5 ± 1.8 vs HFNC: 7.4 ± 3.0 L,p > 0.05), stroke volume (NC:73.5 ± 21.0 vs HFNC 67.5 ± 16.3 ml, p > 0.05). The changes of hHb in muscle tissues was significantly lower in HFNC test than that in NC test (p < 0.05). Conclusion: HFNC resulted in a significant decrease in CO2 production and increase in exercise duration. The application of HFNC may improve the efficiency of exercise training by allowing patients to sustain exercise for longer time.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 SPIE.Background: Acute scrotum is a urologic condition defined by scrotal pain, swelling, and redness of acute onset. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are necessary to preserve testicular viability. The history and clinical symptoms reported are key to diagnosis and proper treatment, but are not always readily obtained in children, in whom common causes of acute scrotum include testicular torsion, torsion of the appendix testis, and epididymitis. These acute conditions have different causal pathology that mandate specific treatment, hence the importance of early and accurate diagnosis. Methods: A novel optical method was developed for rapid evaluation of acute scrotum by measuring and comparing an absolute measure of tissue oxygen saturation index (TSI %) obtained non-invasively from the affected testis and a control site (skin surface of quadriceps muscle), using a wireless continuous wave near infrared spectroscopy device with spatially resolved configuration (SR-NIRS). Results: Five male children with symptoms of acute scrotum were studied using SR-NIRS in addition to standard practices for diagnosis (history, physical examination, lab tests, color Doppler ultrasonography of the testis and surgical exploration when necessary). SR-NIRS successfully differentiated between three conditions by showing a higher TSI% in 2 cases of epididymitis, lower TSI% in 2 cases of testicular torsion and normal TSI% in 1 case of torsion of the appendix testis. Conclusion: This pilot study indicates that SR-NIRS monitoring of (TSI%) in the testes is feasible as a non-invasive, bedside and quick optical method to identify differences in an absolute measure of tissue oxygenation, and that such measurement offers a new adjunct for differential diagnosis of the causal pathology of acute scrotum in children.},

abstract = {Repetitive electrically-evoked muscle contraction leads to accelerated muscle fatigue. This study assessed electrically-evoked fatiguing muscle with changes to mechanomyography root mean square percentage (%RMS-MMG) and tissue saturation index (%TSI) in extensor carpi radialis. Forty healthy volunteers (n=40) performed repetitive electrical-evoked wrist extension to fatigue and results were analyzed pre- and post-fatigue, i.e. 50% power output (%PO) drop. Responses of %PO, %TSI and %RMS-MMG were correlated while the relationships between %RMS-MMG and %TSI were investigated using linear regression. The %TSI for both groups were negatively correlated with declining %PO as the ability of the muscle to take up oxygen became limited due to fatigued muscle. The %RMS-MMG behaved in two different patterns post-fatigue against declining %PO whereby; (i) group A showed positive correlation (%RMS-MMG decreased) throughout the session and (ii) group B demonstrated negative correlation (%RMS-MMG increased) with declining %PO until the end of the session. Regression analysis showed %TSI was inversely proportional to %RMS-MMG during post-fatigue in group A. Small gradients in both groups suggested that %TSI was not sensitive to the changes in %RMS-MMG and they were mutually exclusive. Most correlation and regression changed significantly post-fatigue indicating that after fatigue, the condition of muscle had changed mechanically and physiologically.},

abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the effects of sustained hypoxic exposure on cerebral and muscle oxygenation and cardiorespiratory function at rest. Eleven healthy subjects inhaled a normobaric hypoxic (FiO2=0.12) or normoxic (FiO2=0.21) gas mixture for 4 h at rest, on two separated blinded sessions. Arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate variability (HRV), end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2), and oxygenation of quadriceps muscle, prefrontal and motor cortices assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) were measured continuously during each session. Acute mountain sickness symptoms were evaluated at the end of each session. During a hypoxic session, SpO2 reduction (∼13%) plateaued after 20 min, while deoxygenation pattern took 30 to 40 min at the cerebral sites to plateau (+5.3±1.6  $\mu$Mol of deoxygenated-hemoglobin). Deoxygenation was more pronounced in the cerebral cortex compared to the muscle (+2.1±2.3  $\mu$Mol of deoxygenated-hemoglobin), and NIRS-derived tissue perfusion index showed distinct profiles between the muscle (hypoperfusion) and the brain (hyperperfusion) with prolonged hypoxia. Changes in tissue oxygenation were not associated with cardiorespiratory responses (e.g., HRV, EtCO2) and altitude sickness symptom appearance during hypoxic sessions. These data demonstrate that sustained hypoxia elicits time delay in changes between arterial and tissue (especially cerebral) oxygenation, as well as a tissue-specific sensitivity.},

abstract = {Background: Speech understanding may rely not only on auditory, but also on visual information. Non-invasive functional neuroimaging techniques can expose the neural processes underlying the integration of multisensory processes required for speech understanding in humans. Nevertheless, noise (from functional MRI, fMRI) limits the usefulness in auditory experiments, and electromagnetic artifacts caused by electronic implants worn by subjects can severely distort the scans (EEG, fMRI). Therefore, we assessed audio-visual activation of temporal cortex with a silent, optical neuroimaging technique: functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Methods: We studied temporal cortical activation as represented by concentration changes of oxy-and deoxy-hemoglobin in four, easy-to-apply fNIRS optical channels of 33 normal-hearing adult subjects and five post-lingually deaf cochlear implant (CI) users in response to supra-threshold unisensory auditory and visual, as well as to congruent auditory-visual speech stimuli. Results: Activation effects were not visible from single fNIRS channels. However, by discounting physiological noise through reference channel subtraction (RCS), auditory, visual and audiovisual (AV) speech stimuli evoked concentration changes for all sensory modalities in both cohorts (p < 0.001). Auditory stimulation evoked larger concentration changes than visual stimuli (p < 0.001). A saturation effect was observed for the AV condition. Conclusions: Physiological, systemic noise can be removed from fNIRS signals by RCS. The observed multisensory enhancement of an auditory cortical channel can be plausibly described by a simple addition of the auditory and visual signals with saturation.},

abstract = {Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can be employed to investigate brain activities associated with regional changes of the oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin concentration by measuring the absorption of near-infrared light through the intact skull. NIRS is regarded as a promising neuroimaging modality thanks to its excellent temporal resolution and flexibility for routine monitoring. Recently, the general linear model (GLM), which is a standard method for functional MRI (fMRI) analysis, has been employed for quantitative analysis of NIRS data. However, the GLM often fails in NIRS when there exists an unknown global trend due to breathing, cardiac, vasomotion, or other experimental errors. We propose a wavelet minimum description length (Wavelet-MDL) detrending algorithm to overcome this problem. Specifically, the wavelet transform is applied to decompose NIRS measurements into global trends, hemodynamic signals, and uncorrelated noise components at distinct scales. The minimum description length (MDL) principle plays an important role in preventing over- or underfitting and facilitates optimal model order selection for the global trend estimate. Experimental results demonstrate that the new detrending algorithm outperforms the conventional approaches.},

@article{minati_variability_2011,
abstract = {Brain near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is emerging as a potential alternative to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). To date, no study has explicitly compared the two techniques in terms of measurement variability, a key parameter dictating attainable statistical power. Here, NIRS and fMRI were simultaneously recorded during event-related visual stimulation. Inter-subject coefficients of variation (CVs) for peak response amplitude were considerably larger for NIRS than fMRI, but inter-subject CVs for response latency and intra-subject CVs for response amplitude were overall comparable. Our results may represent an optimistic estimate of the CVs of NIRS measurements, as optode positioning was guided by structural MRI, which is normally unavailable. We concluded that fMRI may be preferable to NIRS for group comparisons, but NIRS is equally powerful when comparing conditions within participants. The discrepancy between inter- and intra-subject CVs is likely related to variability in head anatomy and tissue properties, which may be better accounted for by emerging NIRS technology. {\textcopyright} 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) is a major problem in nowadays health care and creates high financial costs and personal distress. Average prevalence rates in the Netherlands vary from 20-40% of the working population. Insight into the patho-physiological mechanism of RSI is important in order to establish adequate treatment and prevention programs. Objective: The aim of this study was to gain insight in muscle oxygen consumption (mVO(2)), blood flow (BF), and reoxygenation (ReOx) in the forearm of computer workers with stage III Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI). Method: We have used continuous wave infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to measure these variables. Measurements were conducted on the extensor and flexor muscle in both arms as well in RSI-patients (n=10) as in control subjects (n=21). A protocol of increased isometric repetitive contraction in a handgrip ergonometer was used with increasing levels of strength. Results: mVO(2) in the extensor muscle in RSI-subjects (dominant side) was increased compared to control subjects and compared to the non-dominant side (p<0.05). ReOx was not increased in RSI (dominant side-extensor muscle). However, there was a tendency towards statistical significance (p=0.065). BF in rest was equal in both groups, however after exercise it tended to be increased. Half-time recovery (T-1/2) was measured during only one part of the protocol and it was significantly increased (p<0.05). Conclusion: mVO(2) in RSI is impaired. BF and ReOx did not show difference between both groups. Future research should aim at a microvascular dysfunction in RSI.},

abstract = {Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive vascular-based functional neuroimaging technology that can assess, simultaneously from multiple cortical areas, concentration changes in oxygenated-deoxygenated hemoglobin at the level of the cortical microcirculation blood vessels. fNIRS, with its high degree of ecological validity and its very limited requirement of physical constraints to subjects, could represent a valid tool for monitoring cortical responses in the research field of neuroergonomics. In virtual reality (VR) real situations can be replicated with greater control than those obtainable in the real world. Therefore, VR is the ideal setting where studies about neuroergonomics applications can be performed. The aim of the present study was to investigate, by a 20-channel fNIRS system, the dorsolateral/ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC/VLPFC) in subjects while performing a demanding VR hand-controlled task (HCT). Considering the complexity of the HCT, its execution should require the attentional resources allocation and the integration of different executive functions. The HCT simulates the interaction with a real, remotely-driven, system operating in a critical environment. The hand movements were captured by a high spatial and temporal resolution 3-dimensional (3D) hand- sensing device, the LEAP motion controller, a gesture-based control interface that could be used in VR for tele-operated applications. Fifteen University students were asked to guide, with their right hand/forearm, a virtual ball (VB) over a virtual route (VROU) reproducing a 42 m narrow road including some critical points. The subjects tried to travel as long as possible without making VB fall. The distance traveled by the guided VB was 70.2 ± 37.2 m. The less skilled subjects failed several times in guiding the VB over the VROU. Nevertheless, a bilateral VLPFC activation, in response to the HCT execution, was observed in all the subjects. No correlation was found between the distance traveled by the guided VB and the corresponding cortical activation. These results confirm the suitability of fNIRS technology to objectively evaluate cortical hemodynamic changes occurring in VR environments. Future studies could give a contribution to a better understanding of the cognitive mechanisms underlying human performance either in expert or non-expert operators during the simulation of different demanding/fatiguing activities.},

Exercise in cold environments is also known to enhance lipid oxidation, however the immediate and long-term effects of HIIE exercise in cold are unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects cold stress during HIIE on acute exercise metabolism and postprandial metabolism. Eleven recreationally active individuals (age: 23±3 years, weight: 80±9.7 kg, V̇O 2peak : 39.2±5.73 mL{\textperiodcentered}kg -1 {\textperiodcentered}min -1 ) performed evening HIIE sessions (10x60s cycling, 90% V̇O 2peak interspersed with 90s active recovery, 30% V̇O 2peak ) in thermoneutral (HIIE-TN, control; 21°C) and cold environments (HIIE-CO; 0°C), following a balanced crossover design. The following morning, participants consumed a high-fat meal. Indirect calorimetry was used to assess substrate oxidation, and venous blood samples were obtained to assess changes in noncellular metabolites. During acute exercise, lipid oxidation was 113% higher in HIIE-CO (p=0.002) without differences in V̇O 2 and EE (p≥0.162) between conditions. Postprandial V̇O 2 , lipid and CHO oxidation, plasma insulin and triglyceride concentrations were not different between conditions (p>0.05). Postprandial blood LDL-C levels were higher in HIIE-CO two hours after the meal (p=0.003). Postprandial glucose AUC was 49% higher in HIIE-CO vs HIIE-TN (p=0.034). Under matched energy expenditure conditions, HIIE demonstrated higher lipid oxidation rates during exercise in the cold; but only marginally influenced postprandial lipid metabolism the following morning. In conclusion, HIIE in the cold seemed to be less favorable for postprandial lipid and glycemic responses. },

abstract = {Already in an early disease stage, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are confronted with impaired skeletal muscle function and physical performance due to a loss of oxidative type I muscle fibers and oxidative capacity (i.e. oxidative phenotype; Oxphen). Physical activity is a well-known stimulus of muscle Oxphen and crucial for its maintenance. We hypothesized that a blunted response of Oxphen genes to an acute bout of exercise could contribute to decreased Oxphen in COPD. For this28 patients with less advanced COPD (age 6567 yrs, FEV1 59616% predicted) and 15 age- and gender-matched healthy controls performed an incremental cycle ergometry test. The Oxphen response to exercise was determined by the measurement of gene expression levels of Oxphen markers in pre and 4h-post exercise quadriceps biopsies. Because exercise-induced hypoxia and oxidative stress may interfere with Oxphen response, oxygen saturation and oxidative stress markers were assessed as well. Regardless of oxygen desaturation and absolute exercise intensities, the Oxphen regulatory response to exercise was comparable between COPD patients and controls with no evidence of increased oxidative stress. In conclusion, the muscle Oxphen regulatory response to acute exercise is not blunted in less advanced COPD, regardless of exercise-induced hypoxia. Hence, this study provides further rationale for incorporation of exercise training as integrated part of disease management to prevent or slow down loss of muscle Oxphen and related functional impairment in COPD. {\textcopyright} 2014 Slot et al.},

A recent study has investigated the effectiveness of BR on exercise performance during supramaximal intensity intermittent exercise (SIE) in Olympic-level track cyclists, but studies conducted in elite endurance athletes are scarce. The present study aimed to determine whether BR supplementation enhances the tolerance to SIE in elite endurance athletes. Methods: Eleven elite endurance athletes (age: 21.7 ± 3.7 years, maximal oxygen uptake (Formula presented.) 71.1 ± 5.2 mL{\textperiodcentered}kg−1{\textperiodcentered}min−1) performed an SIE test until exhaustion following either a 3-day BR supplementation (340 mg/d) or a placebo (PL) supplementation (<2.5 mg/d) in a randomized, single blind, placebo-controlled, and crossover study. The exercise test consisted of 15-second cycling exercise bouts at 170% of the maximal aerobic power interspersed with 30-second passive recovery periods. Gas exchange was measured during SIE tests as local muscle O2 delivery and extraction were assessed by near infrared spectroscopy. Results: The number of repetitions completed was not significantly different between BR (13.9 ± 4.0 reps) and PL conditions (14.2 ± 4.5 reps). BR supplementation did not affect oxygen uptake ((Formula presented.)) during SIE tests (BR: 3378.5 ± 681.8 mL{\textperiodcentered}min−1, PL: 3466.1 ± 505.3 mL{\textperiodcentered}min−1). No significant change in the areas under curves was found for local muscle total hemoglobin (BR: 6816.9 ± 1463.1 arbitrary units (a.u.), PL: 6771.5 ± 3004.5 a.u.) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (BR: 6619.7 ± 875.8 a.u., PL: 6332.7 ± 1336.8 a.u.) during time-matched work + recovery periods from SIE tests following BR supplementation. Conclusions: BR supplementation does not enhance the tolerance to SIE in elite endurance athletes and affects neither (Formula presented.) nor local muscle O2 delivery and extraction.},

abstract = {Prevalence of masticatory parafunctions, such as tooth clenching and grinding, is higher among migraineurs than non-migraineurs, and masticatory dysfunctions may aggravate migraine. Migraine predisposes to cerebrovascular disturbances, possibly due to impaired autonomic vasoregulation, and sensitization of the trigeminovascular system. The relationships between clenching, migraine, and cerebral circulation are poorly understood. We used Near-Infrared Spectroscopy to investigate bilateral relative oxy-(%∆[O2 Hb]), deoxy-(%∆[HHb]), and total (%∆[tHb]) hemoglobin concentration changes in prefrontal cortex induced by maximal tooth clenching in twelve headache-free migraineurs and fourteen control subjects. From the start of the test, migraineurs showed a greater relative increase in right-side %∆[HHb] than controls, who showed varying reactions, and right-side increase in %∆[tHb] was also greater in migraineurs (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively, time-group interactions, Linear mixed models). With multivariate regression model, migraine predicted the magnitude of maximal blood pressure increases, associated in migraineurs with mood scores and an intensity of both headache and painful signs of temporomandibular disorders (pTMD). Although changes in circulatory parameters predicted maximal NIRS responses, the between-group differences in the right-side NIRS findings remained significant after adjusting them for systolic blood pressure and heart rate. A family history of migraine, reported by all migraineurs and four controls, also predicted maximal increases in both %∆[HHb] and %∆[tHb]. Presence of pTMD, revealed in clinical oral examination in eight migraineurs and eight controls, was related to maximal %∆[HHb] increase only in controls. To conclude, the greater prefrontal right-side increases in cerebral %∆[HHb] and %∆[tHb] may reflect disturbance of the tooth clenching-related cerebral (de)oxygenation based on impaired reactivity and abnormal microcirculation processes in migraineurs. This finding may have an impact in migraine pathophysiology and help to explain the deleterious effect of masticatory dysfunctions in migraine patients. However, the role of tooth clenching as a migraine trigger calls for further studies.},

abstract = {Low muscle oxidative capacity contributes to exercise intolerance in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) allows non-invasive determination of the muscle oxygen consumption (mV̇O2) recovery rate constant (k), which is proportional to oxidative capacity assuming two conditions are met: 1) exercise intensity is sufficient to fully-activate mitochondrial oxidative enzymes; 2) sufficient O2 availability. We aimed to determine reproducibility (coefficient of variation, CV; intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC) of NIRS k assessment in the gastrocnemius of 64 participants with (FEV1 64 ± 23%predicted) or without COPD (FEV1 98 ± 14%predicted). 10–15 s dynamic contractions preceded 6 min of intermittent arterial occlusions (5–10 s each, ∼250 mmHg) for k measurement. k was lower (P < 0.05) in COPD (1.43 ± 0.4 min−1; CV = 9.8 ± 5.9%, ICC = 0.88) than controls (1.74 ± 0.69 min−1; CV = 9.9 ± 8.4%; ICC = 0.93). Poor k reproducibility was more common when post-contraction mV̇O2 and deoxygenation were low, suggesting insufficient exercise intensity for mitochondrial activation and/or the NIRS signal contained little light reflected from active muscle. The NIRS assessment was well tolerated and reproducible for muscle dysfunction evaluation in COPD.},

abstract = {Purpose: Nitrate (NO3-), through its conversion to nitrite (NO2-) and nitric oxide, has been shown to increase exercise tolerance in healthy younger adults and older diseased patients. Nitrate's effect in well-trained middle to older-aged adults has not been studied. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to examine the effects of a NO3- rich beverage on submaximal constant work rate exercise time in well-trained middle to older-aged adults. Methods: This was a randomized controlled cross-over trial with 15 well-trained middle to older-aged adults, 41-64 year-old, who received one of two treatments (NO3- rich beverage then placebo or placebo then NO3- rich beverage), after which an exercise test at 75 percent of the subject's maximal work rate was completed. Results: The NO3- rich beverage increased plasma NO3- and NO2- levels by 260 $\mu$M and 0.47 $\mu$M, respectively (p<0.001). Exercise time was not significantly different (p = 0.31) between the NO3- rich versus placebo conditions (1130±151 vs 1060±132 sec, respectively). Changes in exercise time between the two conditions ranged from a 55% improvement to a 40% decrease with the NO3- rich beverage. Oxygen consumption and rating of perceived exertion were not significantly different between the two conditions. Conclusion: In middle to older-aged well-trained adults, NO3- supplementation has non-significant, albeit highly variable, effects on exercise tolerance.},

abstract = {Purpose: This study aimed to determine the neuro-mechanical and metabolic adjustments in the lower limbs induced by the running anaerobic sprint test (the so-called RAST). Methods: Eight professional football players performed 6 × 35 m sprints interspersed with 10 s of active recovery on artificial turf with their football shoes. Sprinting mechanics (plantar pressure insoles), root mean square activity of the vastus lateralis (VL), rectus femoris (RF), and biceps femoris (BF) muscles (surface electromyography, EMG) and VL muscle oxygenation (near-infrared spectroscopy) were monitored continuously. Results: Sprint time, contact time and total stride duration increased from the first to the last repetition (+17.4, +20.0 and +16.6 %; all P < 0.05), while flight time and stride length remained constant. Stride frequency (−13.9 %; P < 0.001) and vertical stiffness decreased (−27.2 %; P < 0.001) across trials. Root mean square EMG activities of RF and BF (−18.7 and −18.1 %; P < 0.01 and 0.001, respectively), but not VL (−1.2 %; P > 0.05), decreased over sprint repetitions and were correlated with the increase in running time (r = −0.82 and −0.90; both P < 0.05). Together with a better maintenance of RF and BF muscles activation levels over sprint repetitions, players with a better repeated-sprint performance (lower cumulated times) also displayed faster muscle de- (during sprints) and re-oxygenation (during recovery) rates (r = −0.74 and −0.84; P < 0.05 and 0.01, respectively). Conclusion: The repeated anaerobic sprint test leads to substantial alterations in stride mechanics and leg-spring behaviour. Our results also strengthen the link between repeated-sprint ability and the change in neuromuscular activation as well as in muscle de- and re-oxygenation rates.},

We performed general linear modeling (GLM) that putatively associated the lobular electric field strength with the changes in the fNIRS-EEG measures at the ipsilesional and contra-lesional PFC and SMC. Here, fNIRS-EEG measures were found in the latent space from canonical correlation analysis (CCA) between the changes in total hemoglobin (tHb) concentrations (0.01–0.07Hz and 0.07–0.13Hz bands) and log10-transformed EEG bandpower within 1–45 Hz where significant (Wilks' lambda>0.95) canonical correlations were found only for the 0.07–0.13-Hz band. Also, the first principal component (97.5% variance accounted for) of the mean lobular electric field strength was a good predictor of the latent variables of oxy-hemoglobin (O2Hb) concentrations and log10-transformed EEG bandpower. GLM also provided insights into non-responders to ctDCS who also performed poorly in the VBaT due to ideomotor apraxia. Future studies should investigate fNIRS-EEG joint-imaging in a larger cohort to identify non-responders based on GLM fitting to the fNIRS-EEG data.},

abstract = {Frailty in older adults is characterised by dysregulation in multiple physiological systems. The frailty phenotype is defined on the basis of exhaustion, unexplained weight loss, weakness, slowness and low physical activity (one or two: pre-frail; 3 or more: frail). Our aim was to explore if increasing frailty is associated with the complexity of resting state physiological signals in a large cohort of community-dwelling older adults, enrolled as part of The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA). Systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and heart rate (HR) were measured in 3154 participants (66.2% non-frail; 31.3% pre-frail; 2.5% frail) using a Finometer{\textregistered}device at 200 Hz; and frontal lobe oxygenation (tissue saturation index (TSI)) in 2749 individuals (66.3% non-frail; 31.3% pre-frail; 2.4% frail) at 50Hz using an Artinis Portalite{\textregistered}near infrared spectroscopy system. Data were acquired continuously during five minutes of supine rest and the last minute (downsampled to 5 Hz) was utilised in these analyses. The complexity of signals was quantified using approximate entropy (ApEn) with m = 2 and an optimal r derived via multiple iterations, implemented in Matlab (R2019a). Statistical analysis was performed using multivariate linear regression models in STATA (v14.1), controlling for age, sex, education, antihypertensive medication, diabetes, number of cardiovascular conditions, smoking, alcohol, and depression. Mean age for both groups was 64.3 ± 8.1 years and 53% were female. The pre-frail group was associated with significantly increased ApEn for all measures investigated (sBP: $\beta$ = 0.014, p ≤ 0.001; dBP: $\beta$ = 0.009, p = 0.002; MAP: $\beta$ = 0.012, p ≤ 0.001; HR: $\beta$ = 0.011, p = 0.003; TSI: $\beta$ = 0.009, p = 0.002). Likewise, the frail group was associated with further increased ApEn for all measures investigated (sBP: $\beta$ = 0.031, p = 0.002; dBP: $\beta$ = 0.028, p = 0.003; MAP: $\beta$ = 0.038, p ≤ 0.001; HR: $\beta$ = 0.034, p = 0.001; TSI: $\beta$ = 0.018, p = 0.029). Approximate entropy seems to be a sensitive method to capture increasing signal complexity in multiple physiological systems associated with the frailty phenotype during resting state.},

abstract = {Listening to music engages the whole brain, thus stimulating cognitive performance in a range of non-purely musical activities such as language and memory tasks. This article addresses an ongoing debate on the link between music and memory for words. While evidence on healthy and clinical populations suggests that music listening can improve verbal memory in a variety of situations, it is still unclear what specific memory process is affected and how. This study was designed to explore the hypothesis that music specifically benefits the encoding part of verbal memory tasks, by providing a richer context for encoding and therefore less demand on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Twenty-two healthy young adults were subjected to functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) imaging of their bilateral DLPFC while encoding words in the presence of either a music or a silent background. Behavioral data confirmed the facilitating effect of music background during encoding on subsequent item recognition. fNIRS results revealed significantly greater activation of the left hemisphere during encoding (in line with the HERA model of memory lateralization) and a sustained, bilateral decrease of activity in the DLPFC in the music condition compared to silence. These findings suggest that music modulates the role played by the DLPFC during verbal encoding, and open perspectives for applications to clinical populations with prefrontal impairments, such as elderly adults or Alzheimer's patients. {\textcopyright} 2013 Ferreri, Aucouturier, Muthalib, Bigand and Bugaiska.},

Infants with PHVD were studied during CSF drainage from a SVCR on the day of SVCR placement, half a week and one week after SVCR placement. Changes in cHbD and CBV were assessed using near infrared spectrophotometry. Time averaged peak flow velocity (TAPFV), end diastolic flow velocity (EDFV), peak systolic flow velocity (PSFV) and pulsatility index (PI) were measured before (baseline) and after CSF drainage using Doppler ultrasound. Longitudinal data analysis was performed using linear mixed models. Seven patients (GA 26.7-40.4 weeks, BW 800-4575 g) were studied. CSF drainage resulted in a statistically significant increase in CBV during each measurement. The change in CBV was maximal on the day of SVCR placement. A significant increase in cHbD and EDFV, and decrease in PI was observed after CSF drainage only on the day of SVCR placement. Baseline values of all Doppler variables improved consecutively after serial CSF removal in the first week after SVCR placement. Frequent CSF drainage results in consecutive improvement of cerebral perfusion and oxygenation in infants with PHVD. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Hemispheric asymmetries have long been seen as characterizing the human brain; yet, an increasing number of reports suggest the presence of such brain asymmetries in our closest primate relatives. However, most available data in non-human primates have so far been acquired as part of neurostructural approaches such as MRI, while comparative data in humans are often dynamically acquired as part of neurofunctional studies. In the present exploratory study in baboons (Papio anubis), we tested whether brain lateralization could be recorded non-invasively using a functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) device in two contexts: motor and auditory passive stimulations. Under light propofol anaesthesia monitoring, three adult female baboons were exposed to a series of (1) left- versus right-arm passive movement stimulations; and (2) left- versus right-ear versus stereo auditory stimulations while recording fNIRS signals in the related brain areas (i.e., motor central sulcus and superior temporal cortices respectively). For the sensorimotor condition our results show that left-arm versus right-arm stimulations induced typical contralateral difference in hemispheric activation asymmetries in the three subjects. For the auditory condition, we also revealed typical human-like patterns of hemispheric asymmetries in one subject, namely a leftward lateralization for right ear stimulations for all three channels. Overall, our findings support the use of fNIRS to investigate brain processing in non-human primates from a functional perspective, opening the way for the development of non-invasive procedures in non-human primate brain research.},

abstract = {In most daily activities related to work or leisure, the energy for muscle work substantially comes from oxidative metabolism. Functional limitations or impairments of this metabolism can significantly affect exercise tolerance and performance. As a method for the functional evaluation of skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has important strengths but also several limitations, some of which have been overcome by recent technological developments. Skeletal muscle fractional O2 extraction, the main variable which can be noninvasively evaluated by NIRS, is the result of the dynamic balance between O2 utilization and O2 delivery; it can yield relevant information on key physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms, relevant in the evaluation of exercise performance and exercise tolerance in healthy subjects (in normal and in altered environmental conditions) and in patients. In the right hands, NIRS can offer insights into the physiological and pathophysiological adaptations to conditions of increased O2 needs that involve, in an integrated manner, different organs and systems of the body. In terms of patient evaluation, NIRS allows determination of the evolution of the functional impairments, to identify their correlations with clinical symptoms, to evaluate the effects of therapeutic or rehabilitative interventions, and to gain pathophysiological and diagnostic insights.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the effects of the intensity of short recoveries on performance by a Wingate test and on the deoxyhemoglobin variations. METHODS: Twelve male subjects performed a graded test and three sessions of repeated all-out tests with different recovery natures. The repeated all-out tests included two sprints: a 15-s Wingate test followed by a 30-s Wingate test. The recovery between the two was 15 s in duration and was either passive, active at 20% of maximal aerobic power, or active at 40% of maximal aerobic power. Changes in deoxyhemoglobin were measured using by the near-infrared spectroscopy technique. RESULTS: Mean power (517 ± 26 W) and peak power (1085 ± 153 W) of the 30-s Wingate test performed after passive recovery were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than mean power and peak power performed after active recovery at 20% (484 ± 30 and 973 ± 112 W, respectively) and 40% of maximal aerobic power (492 ± 35 and 928 ± 116 W, respectively). Deoxyhemoglobin variations were significantly higher (P < 0.05) during the passive recovery (12.8 ± 5.3 $\mu$M) than during the active recovery conditions at 20% (4.3 ± 2.6 $\mu$M) and 40% of maximal aerobic power (3.9 ± 2.6 $\mu$M). CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that when two Wingate tests are performed almost successively but with a short recovery between the two, passive recovery is more appropriate than active recovery to restore the performance level. {\textcopyright}2007The American College of Sports Medicine.},

abstract = {Background Deficits in cognitive domains, in particular, those related to the prefrontal cortex, contribute to diminished walking performance in complex conditions in older age. Studies using functional near infra-red spectroscopy (fNIRS) reported inconsistent findings of brain activation age-related changes in response to increased task demands. We aimed to study the effects of aging on gait and prefrontal activation in complex walking tasks with internal and external task demands. Methods Twenty-three healthy young adults (30.9 ± 3.7 yrs) and 20 healthy older adults (69.7 ± 5.8 yrs) participated in this study. Gait and prefrontal activation were assessed during three walking conditions: (1) usual walking, (2) dual tasking (internal task demands) and, (3) obstacle negotiation (external task demands). fNIRS measured changes in oxygenated hemoglobin concentrations in the prefrontal cortex. Results Several gait measures were worse in older compared to younger adults under all walking conditions (p < 0.005). Even at the lowest level of challenge, older adults had significant increases in HbO2 levels during usual walking, relative to standing (p = 0.006). Both groups showed increased activation during dual-task (p < 0.002) and during obstacle negotiation (p < 0.003). Conclusions Prefrontal activation during walking is dependent on age and task properties and that older adults apparently rely more on cognitive resources even during usual walking task.},

abstract = {Background: Complex walking conditions (e.g. dual tasking) have been associated with increased prefrontal (PFC) activity. However, most paradigms include a predictable environment, specifically, a predictable walking terrain. In the present study we investigate PFC activity under an unusual walking condition where each foot placement was on unexpected terrain, thus causing a mismatch between visuospatial perception and lower-extremity proprioception. Research objective: To assess whether PFC activity increases under unstable unpredictable conditions compared to unstable but predictable conditions. Methods: This was a prospective study involving twenty healthy adults. Participants walked in two conditions: unstable but predictable, and unstable and unpredictable. To assess walking stability, both stride-time (ST) and stride-time variability (CV) were measured. To assess PFC activity, two wireless near-infrared spectroscopy devices were used. The group hemodynamic response (GHR) was calculated for each condition. For statistical analysis, a linear-mixed-effects model was used. Results: Walking with unpredictable perturbations did not change the ST (t = 0.51, p = 0.61) but significantly increased the parameter CV (t = 11.74, p < 0.001). The GHR of both conditions indicated brief per-initiation PFC activity that was similar across conditions. However, when GHRs were calculated relative to normal walking (i.e., the participants' own shoes), continuous activity was evident. Compared to the predictable condition, the unpredictable condition significantly increased this activity during steady-state walking (t = 2.13, p = 0.033). Significance: Observations from the present study suggest that at least two neural components are present in the measured signal—a brief one, occurring per-initiation, and a continuous one, sensitive to the predictability of the terrain. The second component was accompanied by a decrease in walking stability. These results may contribute to our understanding of the control mechanism underlying gait and future planning of rehabilitation protocols.},

abstract = {Endothelial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury importantly contributes to the poor prognosis during ischemic (myocardial) events. Preconditioning, i.e., repeated exposure to short periods of ischemia, effectively reduces endothelial I/R injury. In the present study, we examined the hypothesis that exercise has preconditioning effects on endothelial I/R injury. Therefore, we studied whether an acute bout of endurance or interval exercise is able to protect against endothelial I/R injury. In 17 healthy young subjects, we examined changes in brachial artery endothelial function using flow-mediated dilation (FMD) before and after a bout of high-intensity interval exercise, moderate-intensity endurance exercise, or a control intervention. Subsequently, I/R injury was induced by inflation of a blood pressure cuff around the upper arm to 220 mmHg for 20 min and 20 min of reperfusion followed by another FMD measurement. Near-infrared spectrometry was used to examine local tissue oxygenation during exercise. No differences in brachial artery FMD were found at baseline for the three conditions. I/R induced a significant decline in FMD (7.1 ± 2.3 to 4.3 ± 2.3, P < 0.001). When preceded by the interval exercise bout, no change in FMD was present after I/R (7.7 ± 3.1 to 7.2 ± 3.1, P = 0.56), whereas the decrease in FMD after I/R could not be prevented by the endurance exercise bout (7.8 ± 3.1 to 3.8 ± 1.7, P < 0.001). In conclusion, a single bout of lower limb interval exercise, but not moderate-intensity endurance exercise, effectively prevents brachial artery endothelial I/R injury. This indicates the presence of a remote preconditioning effect of exercise, which is selectively present after short-term interval but not continuous exercise in healthy young subjects.},

abstract = {Objective. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements of tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) are useful for the assessment of skeletal muscle perfusion and function during exercise, however, they are influenced by overlying skin and adipose tissue. This study explored the extent and nature of the influence of adipose tissue thickness (ATT) on StO2. Approach. NIR spatially resolved spectroscopy (SRS) derived oxygenation was measured on vastus lateralis in 56 patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) and 20 healthy control (HC) subjects during rest and moderate intensity exercise with simultaneous assessment of oxygen uptake kinetics ($\tau$ ). In vitro measurements were performed on a flow cell with a blood mixture with full oxygen saturation (100%), which was gradually decreased to 0% by adding sodium metabisulfite. Experiments were repeated with 2 mm increments of porcine fat layer between the NIRS device and flow cell up to 14 mm. Main results. Lower ATT, higher $\tau$ , and CHF were independently associated with lower in vivo StO2 in multiple regression analysis, whereas age and gender showed no independent relationship. With greater ATT, in vitro StO2 was reduced from 100% to 74% for fully oxygenated blood and increased from 0% to 68% for deoxygenated blood. Significance. This study shows that ATT independently confounds NIR-SRS derived StO2 by overestimating actual skeletal muscle oxygenation and by decreasing its sensitivity for deoxygenation. Because physiological properties (e.g. presence of disease and slowing of $\tau$ ) also influence NIR-SRS, a correction based on optical properties is needed to interpret calculated values as absolute StO2.},

abstract = {Background and Purpose: Gait and turning impairments are common in people with Parkinson disease (PwPD). Tactile cues delivered in open- or closed-loop modalities may improve gait and turning in PwPD, but underlying mechanisms are unclear. Attention stemming from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) may play a role in cue response, but PFC contributions to specific cue modalities are unclear. Examining how open- and closed-loop cueing influences PFC activity during walking and turning in PwPD may elucidate mechanisms involved in cue response, which could advance development of effective therapeutics. We examined PFC activity during walking and turning in response to open- and closed-loop cueing in PwPD, and explored relationships between PFC activity and behavioral measures. Methods: A mobile functional near-infrared spectroscopy device measured PFC activity during walking and turning in 25 PwPD (n = 13 freezers, n = 12 nonfreezers). Participants performed 180° and 360° turns while walking, and a 2-minute walk under single- and dual-task (AX-CPT) conditions with and without an open- (metronome-like vibration) or closed-loop (biofeedback vibration) tactile cue. Results: PFC activity did not change when walking or turning in PwPD; freezing status or task demands did not influence PFC activity. With both open- and closed-loop cueing dual-task cost of gait significantly improved, whereas turning slowed. Discussion and Conclusions: Our preliminary results indicate that both open- and closed-loop cueing can improve gait without additional burden to the PFC beyond usual walking. However, turning while walking slowed with cueing with no PFC activity change. Further investigations are necessary to establish these findings in a larger cohort.

abstract = {Introduction and Objectives: Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) present respiratory derangements at rest and during exercise, accompanied by exercise intolerance. Some patients may develop profound exertional desaturation even without resting hypoxemia. Evidence suggests the involvement of reduced cerebral-oxygenation in exercise intolerance. We aimed to examine (i) differences in cerebral-oxygenation during exercise between IPF patients with and without isolated exertional desaturation, (ii) whether the impairments in cerebral-oxygenation are detected at similar exercise intensity, and (iii) correlations between cerebral-oxygenation indices, disease severity, and 6-min walk test (6MWT). Materials and Methods: Patients with IPF (n = 24; 62.1 ± 9.3 years) without resting hypoxemia underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) with cerebral-oxygenation monitoring via near-infrared-spectroscopy (NIRS). Βased on their pulse-oxymetry saturation (SpO2) during CPET, patients were divided into the “exertional-desaturators” group (SpO2nadir≤89% and ≥6% drop in SpO2) and the “non-exertional-desaturators” group (SpO2nadir≥90% and ≤5% drop). Results: During CPET, the “exertional-desaturators” group exhibited lower oxygenated-hemoglobin (-0.67 ± 1.48 vs. 0.69 ± 1.75 $\mu$mol/l; p < 0.05) and higher deoxygenated-hemoglobin (1.67 ± 1.13 vs. 0.17 ± 0.62 $\mu$mol/l; p < 0.001) than the “non-exertional-desaturators” group. A different pattern (p < 0.01) in cerebral-oxygenation responses was observed in the two groups. In exertional-desaturators oxygenated-hemoglobin declined below baseline even at low/moderate-intensity exercise (p < 0.05), whereas, in non-exertional-desaturators cerebral-oxygenation declined (p < 0.05) at high-intensity exercise. Cerebral-NIRS indices correlated (p < 0.05) with CPET-duration, dyspnea, diffusion capacity, and 6MWT. Conclusions: During incremental exercise, patients with IPF and exertional desaturation present a significant decline in cerebral-oxygenation even during low-intensity exercise. Our findings support the implementation of longer-duration rehabilitation programs in IPF so that lower intensity exercise can be applied at the initial stages. (NCT 03683082)},

abstract = {Purpose:To investigate the interaction between the development of peripheral locomotor muscle fatigue, muscle recruitment and performance during repeated-sprint exercise (RSE).Method:In a single-blind, randomised and cross-over design, ten male team-sport athletes performed two RSE (fifteen 5-s cycling sprints interspersed with 25 s of rest; power self-selected) in normoxia and in acute moderate hypoxia (FIO2 0.138). Mechanical work, total electromyographic intensity (summed quadriceps electromyograms, RMSsum) and muscle (vastus lateralis) and pre-fontal cortex near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) parameters were calculated for every sprint. Blood lactate concentration ([Lac-]) was measured throughout the protocol. Peripheral quadriceps fatigue was assessed via changes in potentiated quadriceps twitch force ($\Delta$Qtw,pot) pre- versus post-exercise in response to supra-maximal magnetic femoral nerve stimulation. The central activation ratio (QCAR) was used to quantify completeness of quadriceps activation.Results:Compared with normoxia, hypoxia reduced arterial oxygen saturation (-13.7%, P=0.001), quadriceps RMSsum (-13.7%, P=0.022), QCAR (-3.3%, P=0.041) and total mechanical work (-8.3%, P=0.019). However, the magnitude of quadriceps fatigue induced by RSE was similar in the two conditions ($\Delta$Qtw,pot: -53.5% and -55.1%, P=0.71). The lower cycling performance in hypoxia occurred despite similar metabolic (muscle NIRS parameters and blood [Lac-]) and functional (twitch and M-wave) muscle states.Conclusion:Results suggest that the central nervous system regulates quadriceps muscle recruitment and, thereby, performance to limit the development of muscle fatigue during intermittent, short sprints. This finding highlights the complex interaction between muscular perturbations and neural adjustments during sprint exercise, and further supports the presence of pacing during intermittent sprint exercise. {\textcopyright} 2013 Billaut et al.},

We simultaneously recorded from eight EEG and three NIRS channels during different workload conditions of the N-back task (N = 0, 1, 2).

abstract = {Simple lifestyle changes such as improving one's diet and getting sufficient exercise could significantly reduce the risk of developing obesity and related diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. However, changing eating behavior is challenging because eating is a part of the human behavior system. This paper introduces a pilot study that examined the multifactorial neurophysiological correlates of food decision-making behavior, with potential implications for the development of effective treatments for individuals with dysfunctional eating. The experimental protocol was designed in a virtual reality (VR) and real-life (RL) buffet setting. Eleven participants (aged 18-25 years; Mean = 20.45, SD = 2.30) were recruited and equipped with various body sensors (e.g., prefrontal cortex functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), electrocardiography (ECG), galvanic skin response (GSR), eye movement and body motion) to capture their neurological and physiological data as they were making food selections. In this exploratory study, we aimed to identify patterns of neural and physiological activity during food selection and associations with the nutritional content of individuals' final food selection in VR and RL buffets. Findings revealed that the left inferior frontal gyrus demonstrated significant differential activation when subjects chose high compared to low density food in both settings. These findings suggest that VR simulations may provide similar neural response to real world environments, particularly in control regions of the brain.},

abstract = {Purpose: Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has recently been proposed as an indirect technique to assess brown adipose tissue (BAT) in young men. NIRS arises as a novel technique to avoid the limitations of the “gold-standard” 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]DG) positron emission tomography combined with X-ray computed tomography (PET/CT). The aim of this study was to examine the association between near-infrared spatially resolved spectroscopy (NIRSRS) parameters and BAT volume and activity estimated by [18F]DG-PET/CT in 18 young healthy women. Procedures: NIRSRS parameters [tissue saturation index and concentrations of total haemoglobin, oxy-haemoglobin, and deoxy-haemoglobin] were continuously measured in the supraclavicular and forearm regions, in both warm and cold (2 h of personalised cold exposure) conditions. Then, the NIRSRS data were analysed as an average of 5 min in 4 different periods: (i) warm period as the baseline record, (ii) cold period I, (iii) cold period II, and (iv) cold period III. The data were then correlated with BAT volume and activity (SUVmean and SUVpeak) estimated by [18F]DG-PET/CT. Results: There was no association between the NIRSRS parameters in the supraclavicular region in warm conditions (no previous cold exposure) and BAT volume and activity (P > 0.05). Similarly, the cold-induced changes of the NIRSRS parameters in the supraclavicular region were not associated with BAT volume and activity (P > 0.05). Conclusions: NIRSRS does not seem to be a valid technique to indirectly assess BAT in young healthy women. Further research is needed to validate this technique against other methods such as PET/CT using different radiotracers or magnetic resonance imaging.},

abstract = {Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is characterized by the accumulation of atherosclerotic plaques in the lower extremity conduit arteries, which impairs blood flow and walking capacity. Dietary nitrate has been used to reduce blood pressure (BP) and improve walking capacity in PAD. However, a standardized dose for PAD has not been determined. Therefore, we sought to determine the effects of a body mass-normalized moderate dose of nitrate (0.11 mmol nitrate/kg) as beetroot juice on serum nitrate/nitrite, vascular function, walking capacity, and tissue oxygen utilization capacity in patients with PAD. 11 patients with PAD received either nitrate supplement or placebo in a randomized crossover design. Total serum nitrate/nitrite, resting BP, brachial and popliteal artery endothelial function (flow-mediated dilation, FMD), arterial stiffness (pulse-wave velocity, PWV), augmentation index (AIx), maximal walking distance and time, claudication onset time, and skeletal muscle oxygen utilization were measured pre-and-post-nitrate and placebo intake. There were significant group x time interactions (p<0.05) for serum nitrate/nitrite, FMD, BP, walking distance and time, and skeletal muscle oxygen utilization. The nitrate group showed significantly increased serum nitrate/nitrite ($\Delta$1.32$\mu$M), increased brachial and popliteal FMD ($\Delta$1.3% and $\Delta$1.7%, respectively), reduced peripheral and central systolic BP ($\Delta$-4.7mmHg and $\Delta$-8.2mmHg, respectively), increased maximal walking distance ($\Delta$92.7m) and time ($\Delta$56.3s), and reduced deoxygenated hemoglobin during walking. There were no changes in PWV, AIx, or claudication (p>0.05). These results indicate that a body-mass normalized moderate dose of nitratemay be effective and safe for reducing BP, improving endothelial function, and improving walking capacity in patients with PAD.},

abstract = {Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive optical imaging technique, which is increasingly used to measure hemodynamic responses in the motor cortex. The location at which the NIRS optodes are placed on the skull is a major factor in measuring the hemodynamic responses optimally. In this study, the validity of using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in combination with a 3D motion analysis system to relocate the TMS derived position was tested. In addition, the main goal was to quantify the advantage of using TMS to locate the optimal position in relation to the most commonly used EEG C3 position. Markers were placed on the TMS coil and on the head of the subject. In eleven subjects, a TMS measurement was performed to determine the individual motor-evoked potential center-of-gravity (MEP-CoG). This procedure was repeated in nine subjects to test the validity. Subsequently, hemodynamic responses were measured at the MEP-CoG position and at the C3 position during a thumb abduction and adduction task. On average, the MEP-CoG location was located 19.2. mm away from the C3 position. The reproducibility study on the MEP-CoG relocation procedure revealed no systematic relocations. No differences in early and delayed hemodynamic responses were found between the C3 and MEP-CoG position. These results indicate that using TMS for NIRS optodes positioning on the motor cortex does not result in higher hemodynamic response amplitudes. This could be explained if NIRS and TMS assess slightly different functions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Background Behavioral and cognitive control are vital for healthy eating behavior. Patients with binge eating disorder (BED) suffer under recurrent binge eating episodes accompanied by subjective loss of control that results, among other factors, from increased impulsivity. Methods In the current study, we investigated the frontal network using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during a food specific go/nogo task to assess response inhibition in 24 patients with BED (BMI range 22.6-59.7 kg/m2) compared to 12 healthy controls (HC) (BMI range 20.9-27 kg/m2). Patients with BED were invited to undergo fNIRS measurements before an impulsivity-focused cognitive behavioral group treatment, directly after this treatment and 3 months afterwards. As this was a planned subgroup analysis of the randomized controlled IMPULS trial, patients with BED were randomized either to the treatment group (n=14) or to a control group (n=10). The treatment group received 8 weekly sessions of the IMPULS treatment. Results We found a significant response inhibition effect (nogo minus go), in terms of an increased oxygenated hemoglobin response in the bilateral prefrontal cortex in both groups. The greatest response was observed when participants were instructed to go for healthy and withhold their response to unhealthy high caloric food cues. The healthy nogo condition failed to show a significant prefrontal inhibitory response, which was probably related to the task design, as the condition was considered more demanding. BED patients, especially those with higher trait impulsivity, showed a weaker activation of the prefrontal cortex during response inhibition, predominantly in the right hemisphere. Interestingly, three months after the treatment, patients of the treatment group increased their right prefrontal cortex activity during response inhibition. Likewise, increased prefrontal cortex activation correlated with decreased trait impulsivity after treatment. Conclusions Our results suggest that patients with BED have limited resources to activate the prefrontal cortex when asked to inhibit a reaction onto food-specific stimuli. However, this effect could be partly driven by differences in BMI between the HC and BED group.

abstract = {A lot of research has been done on the detection of mental workload (MWL) using various bio-signals. Recently, deep learning has allowed for novel methods and results. A plethora of measurement modalities have proven to be valuable in this task, yet studies currently often only use a single modality to classify MWL. The goal of this research was to classify perceived mental workload (PMWL) using a deep neural network (DNN) that flexibly makes use of multiple modalities, in order to allow for feature sharing between modalities. To achieve this goal, an experiment was conducted in which MWL was simulated with the help of verbal logic puzzles. The puzzles came in five levels of difficulty and were presented in a random order. Participants had 1 h to solve as many puzzles as they could. Between puzzles, they gave a difficulty rating between 1 and 7, seven being the highest difficulty. Galvanic skin response, photoplethysmograms, functional near-infrared spectrograms and eye movements were collected simultaneously using LabStreamingLayer (LSL). Marker information from the puzzles was also streamed on LSL. We designed and evaluated a novel intermediate fusion multimodal DNN for the classification of PMWL using the aforementioned four modalities. Two main criteria that guided the design and implementation of our DNN are modularity and generalisability. We were able to classify PMWL within-level accurate (0.985 levels) on a seven-level workload scale using the aforementioned modalities. The model architecture allows for easy addition and removal of modalities without major structural implications because of the modular nature of the design. Furthermore, we showed that our neural network performed better when using multiple modalities, as opposed to a single modality. The dataset and code used in this paper are openly available.},

abstract = {Purpose. The physiological mechanisms for alterations in oxygen utilization (V˙O2) and the energy cost of running (Cr) during prolonged running are not completely understood, and could be linked with alterations in muscle and cerebral tissue oxygenation. Methods. Eight trained ultramarathon runners (three women; mean ± SD; age 37 ± 7 yr; maximum V˙O2 60 ± 15 mL min-1 kg-1) completed a 6 hr treadmill run (6TR), which consisted of four modules, including periods of moderate (3 min at 10 km h-1, 10-CR) and heavy exercise intensities (6 min at 70% of maximum VO2, HILL), separated by three, 100 min periods of self-paced running (SP). We measured V˙O2, minute ventilation (V˙E), ventilatory efficiency (V˙E:VO2), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), Cr, muscle and cerebral tissue saturation index (TSI) during the modules, and heart rate (HR) and perceived exertion (RPE) during the modules and SP. Results. Participants ran 58.3 ± 10.5 km during 6TR. Speed decreased and HR and RPE increased during SP. Across the modules, HR and V˙O2 increased (10-CR), and RER decreased (10-CR and HILL). There were no significant changes in V˙E, V˙E:V˙O2, Cr, TSI and RPE across the modules. Conclusions. In the context of positive pacing (decreasing speed), increased cardiac drift and perceived exertion over the 6TR, we observed increased RER and increased HR at moderate and heavy exercise intensity, increased V˙O2 at moderate intensity, and no effect of exercise duration on ventilatory efficiency, energy cost of running and tissue oxygenation.},

We investigated whether 7-day Montmorency cherry powder supplementation improved cycling time-trial (TT) performance. Methods: 8 trained male cyclists (V˙ O 2 peak : 62.3 ± 10.1 ml kg −1  min −1 ) completed 10-min steady-state (SS) cycling at $\sim$ 65% V˙ O 2 peak followed by a 15-km TT on two occasions. Participants consumed 6 pills per day (Montmorency cherry powder, MC; anthocyanin 257 mg day −1 or dextrose powder, PL) for a 7-day period, 3 pills in the morning and evening. Capillary blood [lactate] was measured at baseline, post SS and post TT. Pulmonary gas exchange and tissue oxygenation index (TOI) of m. vastus lateralis via near-infrared spectroscopy, were measured throughout. Results: TT completion time was 4.6 ± 2.9% faster following MC (1506 ± 86 s) supplementation compared to PL (1580 ± 102 s; P = 0.004). Blood [lactate] was significantly higher in MC after SS (PL: 4.4 ± 2.1 vs. MC: 6.7 ± 3.3 mM, P = 0.017) alongside an elevated baseline TOI (PL: 68.7 ± 2.1 vs. MC: 70.4 ± 2.3%, P = 0.018). Discussion: Montmorency cherry supplementation improved 15-km cycling TT performance. This improvement in exercise performance was accompanied by enhanced muscle oxygenation suggesting that the vasoactive properties of the Montmorency cherry polyphenols may underpin the ergogenic effects.},

This study aims to assess the posture-related changes in brain functional connectivity by wavelet phase coherence (WPCO) of oxyhemoglobin concentration change ($\Delta$[HbO2]) signals measured through near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in elderly subjects. The NIRS signals were continuously recorded from the prefrontal cortex and sensorimotor cortical areas in 39 healthy elderly subjects and 22 young healthy subjects during 20 min resting and 10 min standing states. Eight connection types were obtained from the recorded brain areas. The WPCO were calculated in five frequency intervals in each channel pair as follows: I, 0.6–2 Hz; II, 0.145–0.6 Hz; III, 0.052–0.145 Hz; IV, 0.021–0.052 Hz; and V, 0.0095–0.021 Hz. Results show that posture change and age significantly interacts with the right prefrontal cortex (PFC) and left sensorimotor cortex (SMC) connectivity in interval V (F = 5.010, p = 0.028). The left and right PFC connectivity in interval I, the left and right SMC connectivity in interval IV, and the connectivity in interval V, including right PFC and right SMC connectivity, left PFC and left SMC connectivity, and right PFC and left SMC connectivity, showed a significant difference between the Group Elderly and Group Young in response to posture change (p < 0.05). This study provides new insight into the mechanism of posture control, and results may be useful in assessing the risk of postural instability in aged persons.},

abstract = {Context: Musculoskeletal neck and shoulder pain is a prevalent condition with nearly two-thirds of the population experiencing it sometime in their lifespan; factors may include activity level, sex, stress, and postural deficits. The treatment varies, but recent focus is on complementary and alternative medicine. Cupping therapy is a type of alternative medicine that involves a cup placed on the skin secured by suction for an unspecified amount of time. This therapy has been around for thousands of years, but there is much speculation around its true mechanisms on the human body; theories indicate that cupping therapy has an effect on blood flow, inflammation, and pain. Additionally, there has not been pre-defined parameters for the treatment of musculoskeletal pain conditions. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine if different dry cupping treatment times altered changes in superficial and deep subcutaneous tissue hemodynamics. Design: Single-blinded, randomized crossover study Setting: Athletic Training Laboratory Participants: Thirty-two participants volunteered for this study. Participants were included if they were healthy individuals with non-specific neck pain. Participants were excluded if they had cupping therapy or any treatment performed within the past three months to the neck or shoulder area; history of head, neck, or shoulder injury within the past six months resulting in medical care; known blood clotting disorder; allergy to lubricant; or the following medical conditions: hypertension, diabetes, cancer, pregnancy, cardiac failure, renal failure, allergic purpura, hernia, psoriasis, eczema, rosacea, varicose veins, phlebitis, hepatocirrhosis, allergic dermatitis, sunburn, open wound, fever, or were taking anticoagulants. Interventions: Dry cupping therapy for 5, 7.5, and 10 minutes. Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group using block randomization. Outcome Measures: Subcutaneous hemodynamics (superficial and deep oxygenated, deoxygenated, and total hemoglobin) were collected and exported using the Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) Portamon. Change scores were calculated between baseline and immediate post-intervention, immediate and 10 minutes post-intervention, and baseline and 10 minutes post-intervention measurements. Statistical analyses were completed using repeated measures ANOVAs to compare changes in subcutaneous hemodynamics following different treatment times (5, 7.5, and 10 minutes). Results: There was a main effect for superficial and deep oxygenated, deoxygenated, and total hemoglobin (p ≤ 0.001). Post hoc analyses revealed that all treatment times increased hemoglobin levels immediately after intervention and maintained this increase over the 10- minute period for oxygenated and total hemoglobin levels. Conclusions: Dry cupping therapy increases deep and superficial oxygenated, deoxygenated, and total hemoglobin levels at treatment times of 5, 7.5, and 10 minutes. This indicates that clinicians may be able to apply cupping therapy for a shorter period of time and maintain a significant increase in blood flow at the upper trapezius.},

Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is used as a neuroimaging tool for the study of different areas of the brain involved in motor control through the measurement of changes in brain hemodynamics. Its wireless usage and portability has made it suitable for investigating the cortical control of postural balance under static and dynamic testing conditions. Aim of Study. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate studies on cortical activation while performing static and dynamic balance tasks using fNIRS as a tool and emphasizing the location of brain areas activated. Material and Methods. The search was performed following the PRISMA guidelines. Relevant keywords were used for the search through Google Scholar, PubMed, Science Direct, Taylor and Francis, and Scopus. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria. Results. The included studies were found to be of good methodological quality. The results in this review showed that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, sensory motor area and superior temporal gyrus are activated predominantly during static and dynamic balance tasks. Conclusions. The recent findings reflect a whole new scope of analysis involving multitasking during complex motor activities. The fNIRS technique is an adjunct to assess static and dynamic postural imbalances in persons with balance related issues with availability of a greater number of channels and more regions of interest to be covered at one given instance.},

abstract = {Objective: This pilot, prospective, observational, cohort study aimed to examine, for the first time, the in vivo alterations in the oxygenation of the forearm skeletal muscles and the prefrontal lobes during intermittent exercise in women diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), during and after pregnancy. Study Design: Nine pregnant women, diagnosed with GDM, performed a 3-min intermittent handgrip exercise protocol (at 35% of Maximal Voluntary Contraction) during pregnancy (mean 27th gestational week) and following labor (mean 71 weeks). During the protocol, muscle and cerebral oxygenation were assessed with near-infrared spectroscopy. Resting vascular parameters [carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and hemodynamic parameters (using rheocardiography)], and hematological/biochemical parameters during pregnancy and after delivery have been compared. Results: Although changes were observed in certain hematological parameters (p< 0.05), cIMT and hemodynamic parameters were not altered post-partum. In addition, both muscle and cerebral oxygenation parameters during handgrip were not significantly altered post-partum. Conclusions: Despite significant changes in specific hematological parameters in women with GDM, impairments in muscle and cerebral oxygenation during exercise remained at one year after labor. These results indicate that alterations in vascular parameters and muscle/cerebral oxygenation associated with GDM do not entirely reverse post-partum. Future studies are needed to examine which interventions will lead to improvements in microvascular parameters and prevent type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {Turning has been implicated as a complex task that requires both motor and cognitive resources. Accumulating evidence shows that patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) require more steps and more time to complete a turn, however, the role of the prefrontal cortex during turning is not clear. Forty nine patients with PD without freezing of gait (mean age 71.7 ± 1.0 years; 67% men, disease duration 9.7 ± 1.3 years) performed motor and cognitive tests. Prefrontal activation, specifically in Brodmann area 10 (BA10), during turning and usual walking was measured using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The patients with PD were further divided into two subgroups with high and low functional status based on limitations in community ambulation. General Linear Model analysis adjusted for age, gender, disease duration and turn duration was used to assess differences between tasks and subgroups of patients with PD. In addition, Pearson's correlation was performed to assess association between BA10 activation and motor and cognitive scores. Activation in BA10 increased during walking (p < 0.001), while it decreased during turning (p = 0.006). A comparison between the two subgroups of patients with PD revealed that patients with relatively better ambulation decreased prefrontal activation during turning, as compared to patients with relatively worse ambulation (p < 0.001). These findings are the first to show that BA10 plays a different role during turning and walking and that ambulation status may alter BA10 activation during turning. Higher prefrontal activation during turning in the subgroup of patients with relatively worse ambulation may reflect a compensatory attempt at improving performance.},

abstract = {To find a suitable method for measuring regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) rapidly at the bedside is still a matter of investigation. The purpose here was to develop a noninvasive method for bedside rCBF measurement and to validate it with a standard method such as perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In 11 healthy volunteers 44 measurements with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and perfusion-weighted MRI without and with a mean continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) of 10 mbar were carried out. Four (NIRS) optodes were placed bilaterally on the forehead and 25 mg indocyanine green (ICG) was injected. New algorithms were developed to calculate rCBFNIRS and rCBVNIRS. In 6 volunteers data analysis was successful. No complications associated with the method were observed. During CPAP breathing rCBFNIRS decreased from 18.5 + 6.9 16.1 + 6.2 ml/100 g/min (P = 0.034). Mean values for rCBFMRI decreased from 256 ± 90 to 216 ± 62 ml/100 g/min (P = 0.012). Bland and Altman plots showed that the differences did not vary in any systematic way over the range of rCBF or rCBV values assessed and 100% of differences were within the interval mean ± 2 SD of differences. Limits of agreement (mean ± 2 SD) were ± 76.4 ml/100 g/min for rCBF and ± 15.6 ml/100 g for rCBV. The NIRS ICG dye dilution technique is a promising method for serial noninvasive bedside CBF measurements. The preliminary data indicate that measurements are in agreement with values obtained by perfusion-weighted MRI. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

J Strength Cond Res 33(8): 2128-2137, 2019-This study aimed to determine if systemic O2 utilization (VO2) and tissue oxygen extraction (deoxyhemoglobin [HHb]) in the vastus lateralis (VL), gastrocnemius (GAST), and prefrontal cortex were different during exercise between short-term trained (STT, 6-24 months) and long-term trained (LTT, >5 years) young women while controlling for current training load. Thirteen STT and 13 LTT participants completed ramp incremental (RI) and square-wave constant load (SWCL) tests on a cycle ergometer. In LTT compared with STT: (a) VO2 was higher during the RI (p = 0.024) and SWCL (p = 0.001) tests; (b) HHb in the VL (p = 0.044) and GAST (p = 0.027) was higher in the RI test; and (c) there were significant group × intensity interactions for VO2 in the SWCL test. The additional years of aerobic training in LTT compared with STT (LTT 7.1 ± 1.9 vs. STT 1.5 ± 0.4 years) resulted in higher VO2 and HHb in the VL and GAST. These results indicate that in young women, independent of current training load, systemic VO2 and peripheral muscle O2 extraction during exercise continues to increase beyond 24 months of aerobic training.},

Alternative third-line treatments for MDD in adolescents are scarce. Here we aimed to assess the effects of acute tVNS on emotion recognition in adolescents with MDD.MethodsAdolescents (14-17 years) with MDD (n = 33) and non-depressed controls (n = 30) received tVNS or sham-stimulation in a cross-sectional, case-control, within-subject cross-randomized controlled trial, while performing different tasks assessing emotion recognition. Correct responses, response times, and errors of omission and commission on three different computerized emotion recognition tasks were assessed as main outcomes. Simultaneous recordings of electrocardiography and electro dermal activity, as well as sampling of saliva for the determination of $\alpha$-Amylase, were used to quantify the effects on autonomic nervous system function.ResultstVNS had no effect on the recognition of gradually or static expressed emotions but altered response inhibition on the emotional Go/NoGo-Task. Specifically, tVNS increased the likelihood of omitting a response toward sad target-stimuli in adolescents with MDD, while decreasing errors (independent of the target emotion) in controls. Effects of acute tVNS on autonomic nervous system function were found in non-depressed controls only.ConclusionsAcute tVNS alters the recognition of briefly presented facial expressions of negative valence in adolescents with MDD while generally increasing emotion recognition in controls.TVNS seems to specifically alter early visual processing of stimuli of negative emotional valence in MDD. These findings suggest a potential therapeutic benefit of tVNS in adolescent MDD that requires further evaluation within clinical trials.},

They also performed 6×30-m sprints, departing every 30 s, where mean (RSmean) sprint time was calculated. Muscle oxygenation (Near-infrared spectroscopy, NIRS, [Hbdiff]) was measured for $\sim$ 4 min post test. The mean response time of [Hbdiff]-mV̇ O 2 recovery (monoexponential curve fitting, MRT[Hbdiff]-mV̇ O 2) was calculated. Compared with MDTR, STR presented faster MSS (+11.4±6.7%, with 99% chances to observe a substantially greater value) and RSmean (-3.7±5.4%, 78%), but slower MAS (-15.8±8.0%, 100%) and MRT[Hbdiff]-mV̇ O 2 (+46.2±31.7%, 96%). RS mean was largely correlated with MSS [r=-0.83 (90%CL, -0.92;-0.67)], but neither with MAS [r=-0.12 (-0.47;0.25)] nor MRT[Hbdiff]-mV̇ O 2 [r=-0.27(-0.58;0.11)]. RSmean adjusted for MSS (which indirectly reflects RSA) was largely correlated with both MAS [r=0.51(0.18;0.74)] and MRT[Hbdiff]-mV̇ O 2 [r=0.53(0.20;0.75)]. While a fast mV̇ O 2 recovery is associated with an improved RSA, MSS remains of primary importance for overall repeated-sprint performance (i.e., RSmean). {\textcopyright} Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

abstract = {The relationship between alterations in cerebral blood volume (CBV) and central chemosensitivity regulation was studied under neutral metabolic conditions and during metabolic acidosis. Fifteen healthy subjects (56±10 years) were investigated. To induce metabolic acidosis, ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) was given orally. CBV was measured using Near Infrared Spectroscopy during normo- and hypercapnia and related to inspired ventilation (V̇i). A mean acute metabolic acidosis of $\Delta$pH -0.04 was realized with a mean decreased arterialized capillary PCO2 (PcCO2) of 0.20 kPa (1.5 mmHg) (both P<0.001). During normocapnia, CBV was 3.51±0.71 and 3.65±0.56 ml 100 g-1 (mean±S.D.), measured under neutral metabolic conditions and during acute metabolic acidosis, respectively (ns). Corresponding values of V̇i were 7.6±1.4 and 10.0±2.4 l min-1 (P<0.01), respectively. The slopes of the CO2-responsiveness ($\Delta$CBV/$\Delta$PcCO2 and $\Delta$V̇i/$\Delta$PcCO2), were not significantly different during both metabolic conditions. A significant correlation between $\Delta$CBV/$\Delta$PcCO2 and $\Delta$V̇i/$\Delta$PcCO2 was found during metabolic acidosis (P<0.01), but not under neutral metabolic conditions. CBV does not contribute in a predictable way to the regulation of central chemoreceptors. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

VVS was included if they fainted during testing within 5–15 min of upright tilt. We combined TCD and NIRS to obtain estimates of percent change in the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2), cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv), and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF). Over the course of 10 min of upright tilt, CBFv decreased from a baseline of 70 ± 5 to 63 ± 5 cm/sec in controls and 74 ± 3 to 64 ± 3 cm/sec in POTS while decreasing from 74 ± 4 to 44 ± 3 cm/sec in VVS. CMRO2 was unchanged in POTS and controls during tilt while OEF increased by 19 ± 3% and 15 ± 3%, respectively. CMRO2 decreased by 31 ± 3% in VVS during tilt while OEF only increased by 7 ± 3%. Oxyhemoglobin decreased by 1.1 ± 1.3 $\mu$mol/kg brain tissue in controls, by 1.1 ± 1.3 $\mu$mol/kg in POTS, and 11.1 ± 1.3 $\mu$mol/kg in VVS. CBFv and CMRO2 fell steadily in VVS during upright tilt. The deficit in CMRO2 in VVS results from inadequate OEF in the face of greatly reduced CBF.},

abstract = {We assessed respiratory muscles oxygenation responses during a ramp exercise to exhaustion and further explored their relationship with the non-linear increase of VO2 (VO2 excess) observed above the gas-exchange threshold. Ten male cyclists completed a ramp exercise to exhaustion on an electromagnetically braked cycle-ergometer with a rate of increment of 30 W min-1 with continuous monitoring of expired gases (breath-by-breath) and oxygenation status of intercostal muscles. Maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure measurements were taken at rest and at exhaustion. The VO2 excess represents the difference between VO2max observed and VO2max expected using linear equation between the VO2 and the intensity before gas-exchange threshold. The deoxyhemoglobin remained unchanged until 60% of maximal aerobic power (MAP) and thereafter increased significantly by 37 ± 18% and 40 ± 22% at 80% and 100% of MAP, respectively. Additionally, the amplitude of deoxyhemoglobin increase between 60 and 100% of MAP positively correlated with the VO2 excess (r = 0.69, p < 0.05). Compared to exercise start, the oxygen tissue saturation index decreased from 80% of MAP (-4.8 ± 3.2%, p < 0.05) onwards. At exhaustion, maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures declined by 7.8 ± 16% and 12.6 ± 10% (both p < 0.05), respectively. In summary, our results suggest a significant contribution of respiratory muscles to the VO2 excess phenomenon.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine if muscle blood flow during walking exercise and postexercise recovery can be augmented through the application of intermittent compression of the lower legs applied during the diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle. Results from four conditions were assessed: no compression (NoComp), compression during walking (ExComp), compression during postexercise recovery (RecComp), and compression applied throughout (AllComp). Superficial femoral artery (SFA) blood flow was measured (Doppler ultrasound) during rest and postexercise recovery. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP, finger photoplethysmography) was used to calculate vascular conductance as VC SFA flow/MAP. Near infrared spectroscopy measured changes in oxygenated (O2Hb) and deoxygenated hemoglobin concentration throughout the test. Compression during exercise increased SFA blood flow measured over the first 15 s of postexercise recovery (AllComp: 532.2 123.1 mL/min; ExComp: 529.8 99.2 mL/min) compared with NoComp (462.3 87.3 mL/min P 0.05) and corresponded to increased VC (NoComp: 4.7 0.9 mL{\textperiodcentered}min1{\textperiodcentered} mmHg1 versus ExComp: 5.5 1.0 mL{\textperiodcentered}min1{\textperiodcentered}mmHg1, P 0.05). Similarly, compression throughout postexercise recovery also resulted in increased SFA flow (AllComp: 190.5 57.1 mL/min; RecComp: 158.7 49.1 mL/min versus NoComp: 108.8 28.5 mL/min, P 0.05) and vascular conductance. Muscle contractions during exercise reduced total hemoglobin with O2Hb comprising $\sim$57% of the observed reduction. Compression during exercise augmented this reduction (P 0.05) with O2HB again comprising $\sim$55% of the reduction. Total hemoglobin was reduced with compression during postexercise recovery (P 0.05) with O2Hb accounting for $\sim$40% of this reduction. Results from this study indicate that intermittent compression applied during walking and during postexercise recovery enhanced vascular conductance during exercise and elevated postexercise SFA blood flow and tissue oxygenation during recovery.},

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, sham-controlled monocentric study in Grenoble Alpes University Hospital, France. Gait parameters were recorded under single and dual-task conditions using a visuo-verbal cognitive task (Stroop test), before and after the 8-week intervention period. Stride-time variability, a marker of gait control, was the primary study endpoint. Changes in the determinants of gait control were the main secondary outcomes.

A complete case analysis was performed, using a mixed linear regression model. CPAP elicited no significant improvement in stride-time variability compared to sham-CPAP. No difference was found regarding the determinants of gait control. This study is the first RCT to investigate the effects of CPAP on gait control. Eight weeks of CPAP treatment did not improve gait control in severe non-obese OSAS patients. These results substantiate the complex OSAS-neurocognitive function relationship.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of adding strength training with or without vibration to cross-country (XC) skiers' endurance training on double-poling (DP) performance, physiological, and kinematic adaptations. Twenty-one well-trained male XC-skiers combined endurance- and upper-body strength training three times per week, either with (n = 11) or without (n = 10) superimposed vibrations for 8 weeks, whereas eight skiers performed endurance training only (CON). Testing included 1RM in upper-body exercises, work economy, neural activation, oxygen saturation in muscle, and DP kinematics during a prolonged submaximal DP roller ski test which was directly followed by a time to exhaustion (TTE) test. TTE was also performed in rested state, and the difference between the two TTE tests (TTEdiff) determined the ability to maintain DP performance after prolonged exercise. Vibration induced no additional effect on strength or endurance gains. Therefore, the two strength training groups were pooled (STR, n = 21). 1RM in STR increased more than in CON (P <.05), and there were no differences in changes between STR and CON in any measurements during prolonged submaximal DP. STR improved TTE following prolonged DP (20 ± 16%, P <.001) and revealed a moderate effect size compared to CON (ES = 0.80; P =.07). Furthermore, STR improved TTEdiff more than CON (P =.049). In conclusion, STR superiorly improved 1RM strength, DP performance following prolonged submaximal DP and TTEdiff, indicating a specific effect of improved strength on the ability to maintain performance after long-lasting exercise.},

abstract = {Brain activity can be measured using different modalities. Since most of the modalities tend to complement each other, it seems promising to measure them simultaneously. In to be presented research, the data recorded from Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS), simultaneously, are subjected to causality analysis using time-resolved partial directed coherence (tPDC). Time-resolved partial directed coherence uses the principle of state space modelling to estimate Multivariate Autoregressive (MVAR) coefficients. This method is useful to visualize both frequency and time dynamics of causality between the time series. Afterwards, causality results from different modalities are compared by estimating the Spearman correlation. In to be presented study, we used directionality vectors to analyze correlation, rather than actual signal vectors. Results show that causality analysis of the fMRI correlates more closely to causality results of oxy-NIRS as compared to deoxy-NIRS in case of a finger sequencing task. However, in case of simple finger tapping, no clear difference between oxy-fMRI and deoxy-fMRI correlation is identified. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of external work rate on joint specific power and the relationship between knee extension power and vastus lateralis muscle oxygen consumption (mVO2). We measured kinematics and pedal forces and used inverse dynamics to calculate joint power for the hip, knee and ankle joints during an incremental cycling protocol performed by 21 recreational cyclists. Vastus lateralis mVO2 was estimated using near-infrared spectroscopy with an arterial occlusion. The main finding was a non-linear relationship between vastus lateralis mVO2 and external work rate that was characterised by an increase followed by a tendency for a levelling off (R2=0.99 and 0.94 for the quadratic and linear models respectively, p<0.05). When comparing 100 W and 225 W, there was a $\sim$43 W increase in knee extension but still a $\sim$9% decrease in relative contribution of knee extension to external work rate resulting from a $\sim$47 W increase in hip extension. When vastus lateralis mVO2 was related to knee extension power, the relationship was still non-linear (R2=0.99 and 0.97 for the quadratic and linear models respectively, p<0.05). These results demonstrate a non-linear response in mVO2 relative to a change in external work rate. Relating vastus lateralis mVO2 to knee extension power showed a better fit to a linear equation compared to external work rate, but it is not a straight line.},

abstract = {Purpose: We aimed to identify a blood flow restriction (BFR) endurance exercise protocol that would both maximize cardiopulmonary and metabolic strain, and minimize the perception of effort. Methods: Twelve healthy males (23 ± 2 years, 75 ± 7 kg) performed five different exercise protocols in randomized order: HI, high-intensity exercise starting at 105% of the incremental peak power (Ppeak); I-BFR30, intermittent BFR at 30% Ppeak; C-BFR30, continuous BFR at 30% Ppeak; CON30, control exercise without BFR at 30% Ppeak; I-BFR0, intermittent BFR during unloaded exercise. Cardiopulmonary, gastrocnemius oxygenation (StO2), capillary lactate ([La]), and perceived exertion (RPE) were measured. Results: V̇O2, ventilation (V̇E), heart rate (HR), [La] and RPE were greater in HI than all other protocols. However, muscle StO2 was not different between HI (set1—57.8 ± 5.8; set2—58.1 ± 7.2%) and I-BRF30 (set1—59.4 ± 4.1; set2—60.5 ± 6.6%, p < 0.05). While physiologic responses were mostly similar between I-BFR30 and C-BFR30, [La] was greater in I-BFR30 (4.2 ± 1.1 vs. 2.6 ± 1.1 mmol L−1, p = 0.014) and RPE was less (5.6 ± 2.1 and 7.4 ± 2.6; p = 0.014). I-BFR30 showed similar reduced muscle StO2 compared with HI, and increased blood lactate compared to C-BFR30 exercise. Conclusion: Therefore, this study demonstrate that endurance cycling with intermittent BFR promotes muscle deoxygenation and metabolic strain, which may translate into increased endurance training adaptations while minimizing power output and RPE.},

We propose a directed effective connectivity method (TPDC) allowing the capture of both time and frequency evolution of the brain's networks using fNIRS data acquired from healthy subjects performing a continuous finger-tapping task. Using this method we show the directed connectivity patterns among cortical motor regions involved in the task and their significant variations in the strength of information flow exchanges. Intra and inter-hemispheric connections during the motor task with their temporal evolution are also provided.

abstract = {Objective. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an emerging non-invasive brain imaging technique that measures brain activities by using near-infrared light of 650-950 nm wavelength. The major advantages of fNIRS are its low cost, portability, and good temporal resolution as a plausible solution to real-time imaging. Recent research has shown the great potential of fNIRS as a tool for brain-computer interfaces. Approach. This paper presents the first novel technique for fNIRS-based modelling of brain activities using the linear parameter-varying (LPV) method and adaptive signal processing. The output signal of each channel is assumed to be an output of an LPV system with unknown coefficients that are optimally estimated by the affine projection algorithm. The parameter vector is assumed to be Gaussian. Main results. The general linear model (GLM) is very popular and is a commonly used method for the analysis of functional MRI data, but it has certain limitations in the case of optical signals. The proposed model is more efficient in the sense that it allows the user to define more states. Moreover, unlike most previous models, it is online. The present results, showing improvement, were verified by random finger-tapping tasks in extensive experiments. We used 24 states, which can be reduced or increased depending on the cost of computation and requirements. Significance. The t-statistics were employed to determine the activation maps and to verify the significance of the results. Comparison of the proposed technique and two existing GLM-based algorithms shows an improvement in the estimation of haemodynamic response. Additionally, the convergence of the proposed algorithm is shown by error reduction in consecutive iterations. {\textcopyright} 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {This study aimed to examine if the faster pulmonary oxygen uptake (VO2p) phase 2 in children could be explained by increased O 2 availability or extraction at the muscle level. For that purpose, O 2 availability and extraction were assessed using deoxyhemoglobin (HHb) estimated by near-infrared spectroscopy during moderate-intensity constant load cycling exercise in children and young adults. Eleven prepubertal boys and 12 men volunteered to participate in the study. They performed one maximal graded exercise to determine the power associated with the gas exchange threshold (GET) and four constant load exercises at 90% of GET. VO2p and HHb were continuously monitored. VO2p, HHb, and estimated capillary blood flow ( Q ̇ cap ) kinetics were modelled after a time delay and characterized by the time to achieve 63% of the amplitude ($\tau$) and by mean response time (MRT: time delay+$\tau$), respectively. Mean values of $\tau$ for VO2p (P<0.001), of MRT for HHb (P<0.01) and of MRT for Q ̇ cap (P<0.001) were significantly shorter in children. Faster VO2p kinetics have been shown in children; these appear due to both faster O 2 extraction and delivery kinetics as indicated by faster HHb and Q ̇ cap kinetics, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of 90°-changes of direction (COD) during HIE on metabolic and neuromuscular responses. Methods: Eleven male, team sport players (30.5 ± 3.6 y) performed randomly HIE without (straight-line, 2×[10× 22 m]) or with (2×[10× $\sim$16.5 m]) two 90°-COD. To account for the time lost while changing direction, the distance for COD runs during HIE was individually adjusted using the ratio between straight-line and COD sprints. Players also performed 2 countermovement (CMJ) and 2 drop (DJ) jumps, during and post HIE. Pulmonary oxygen uptake (VO2), quadriceps and hamstring oxygenation, blood lactate concentration ($\Delta$[La]<inf>b</inf>), electromyography amplitude (RMS) of eight lower limb muscles and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were measured for each condition. Results: During HIE, CODs had no substantial effects on changes in VO<inf>2</inf>, oxygenation, CMJ and DJ performance and RPE (all differences in the changes rated as unclear). Conversely, compared with straight-line runs, COD-runs were associated with a possibly higher $\Delta$[La]<inf>b</inf> (+9.7 ± 10.4%, with chances for greater/similar/lower values of 57/42/0%) and either a lower (i.e., -11.9 ± 14.6%, 2/13/85 for semitendinosus and -8.5 ± 9.3%, 1/21/78 for lateral gastrocnemius) or equivalent decrease in electromyography amplitude. Conclusion: Adding two 90°-CODs on adjusted distance during two sets of HIE is likely to elicit equivalent decreases in CMJ and DJ height, and similar cardiorespiratory and perceptual responses, despite a lower average running speed. A fatigue-induced modification in lower limb control observed with CODs may have elicited a selective reduction of electromyography activity in hamstring muscles and may induce, in turn, a potential mechanical loss of knee stability. Therefore, changing direction during HIE, with adjusted COD running distances, might be an effective training practice 1) to manipulate some components of the acute physiological load of HIE, 2) to promote long-term COD-specific neuromuscular adaptations aimed at improving performance and knee joint stability.},

abstract = {New Findings: What is the central question of this study? This study aimed to determine the effect of ageing on cardiorespiratory and tissue oxygenation responses to hypoxia during maximal incremental exercise. What is the main finding and its importance? Older healthy subjects had preserved hypoxic cardiorespiratory and tissue oxygenation responses at rest and during moderate exercise. At maximal exercise, they had a reduced hypoxic ventilatory response but similar maximal power output reduction compared with young individuals. This study suggests that until moderate exercise, hypoxic responses are preserved until the age of 70 years and therefore that ageing is not a contraindication for high-altitude sojourn. This study assessed the effects of ageing on cardiorespiratory and tissue oxygenation responses to hypoxia both at rest and during incremental maximal exercise. Sixteen young (20–30 years old) and 15 older healthy subjects (60–70 years old) performed two maximal incremental cycling tests in normoxia and hypoxia (inspiratory oxygen fraction 12%). Cardiorespiratory responses, prefrontal cortex and quadriceps tissue oxygenation (near-infrared spectroscopy) were measured during exercise as well as during hypercapnia at rest. The hypoxic ventilatory response was similar in young compared with older individuals at rest and during moderate-intensity exercise (50% maximal power output: young 0.9 ± 0.2 versus older 1.1 ± 0.8 l min−1 %−1; P > 0.05) but larger in young subjects during high-intensity exercise (maximal power output: 2.2 ± 0.8 versus 1.8 ± 1.1 l min−1 %−1; P < 0.05). The hypoxic cardiac response did not differ between groups both at rest and during exercise. During exercise in hypoxia, young subjects showed greater deoxygenation than older subjects, at both the prefrontal cortex and quadriceps levels. The hypoxia-induced reduction in maximal power output (young −32 ± 5% versus older −30 ± 6%; P > 0.05) and the hypercapnic responses did not differ between groups. Older healthy and active individuals below the age of 70 years have cardiorespiratory and tissue oxygenation responses to hypoxia similar to young individuals both at rest and during moderate-intensity exercise. Despite a lower hypoxic ventilatory response at maximal exercise, older individuals have similar oxygen desaturation and maximal power output reduction compared with young subjects.},

abstract = {Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a well-known method used to measure muscle oxygenation and hemodynamics in vivo. The application of arterial occlusions allows for the assessment of muscle oxygen consumption (mVO 2) using NIRS. The aim of this study was to measure skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity using blood volume-corrected NIRS signals that represent oxygenated hemoglobin/myoglobin (O2Hb) and deoxygenated hemoglobin/myoglobin (HHb). We also assessed the reliability and reproducibility of NIRS measurements of resting oxygen consumption and mitochondrial capacity. Twenty-four subjects, including four with chronic spinal cord injury, were tested using either the vastus lateralis or gastrocnemius muscles. Ten healthy, ablebodied subjects were tested on two occasions within a period of 7 days to assess the reliability and reproducibility. NIRS signals were corrected for blood volume changes using three different methods. Resting oxygen consumption had a mean coefficient of variation (CV) of 2.4% (range 1-32%). The recovery of oxygen consumption (mVO2) after electrical stimulation at 4 Hz was fit to an exponential curve, which represents mitochondrial capacity. The time constant for the recovery of mVO2 was reproducible with a mean CV of 10% (range 1-22%) only when correcting for blood volume changes. We also examined the effects of adipose tissue thickness on measurements of mVO 2. We found the mVO2 measurements using absolute units to be influenced by adipose tissue thickness (ATT), and this relationship was removed when an ischemic calibration was performed, supporting its use to compare mVO2 between individuals of varying ATT. In conclusion, in vivo oxidative capacity can be assessed using blood volume-corrected NIRS signals with a high degree of reliability and reproducibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of acute hypoxia on cerebrovascular hemodynamics, markers of neuro-steroidal modulation and brain-blood barrier (BBB) integrity, and cognition during exercise. Thirty healthy participants (21 ± 4 yrs., BMI 24.0 ± 2.6 kg ∙ m− 2; 15 men) were randomized to both a ≈ 2.5 h normoxic (FiO2 20.0%) and hypoxic (FiO2 12.5%) condition on two separate days. After 1.25 h, participants underwent 10 min of exercise-alone (cycling at 55% HRmax) and 15 min of exercise + cognitive testing. Prefrontal cortex (PFC) tissue oxygenation and middle cerebral artery (MCA) mean blood velocity (MnV) were measured using near-infrared spectroscopy and transcranial Doppler respectively at rest, during exercise-alone, and during exercise + cognitive testing. Salivary levels of dehydroepiandosterone [DHEA], DHEA-sulfate [DHEAS]) and neuron specific enolase (NSE) were measured pre and post exercise. Cognition was assessed using standard metrics of accuracy and reaction time (RT), and advanced metrics from drift-diffusion modeling across memory recognition, N-Back and Flanker tasks. MCA MnV increased from rest to exercise (p < 0.01) and was unchanged with addition of cognitive testing during exercise in both normoxia and hypoxia. PFC oxygenation increased during exercise (p < 0.05) and was further increased with addition of cognitive challenge in normoxia but decreased during exercise in hypoxia (p < 0.05) with further reductions occurring with addition of cognitive tasks (p < 0.05). DHEA and NSE increased and decreased post-exercise, respectively, in both normoxia and hypoxia (p < 0.01). Accuracy on cognitive tasks was similar in normoxia compared to hypoxia, while RT was slower in hypoxia vs normoxia across memory recognition (p < 0.01) and Flanker tasks (p = 0.04). Drift-diffusion modeling suggested changes in memory RT were due to increases in caution (p < 0.01). Overall cognitive performance is maintained during exercise in hypoxia concomitant with slower RT in select cognitive tasks and reduced oxygenation in the PFC. These changes were accompanied by slight increases in neuro-steroidal modulation but appear independent of changes in NSE, a biomarker of BBB integrity. Maintained accuracy and select increases in RT during hypoxic exercise may be related behavioral changes in caution.},

abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate whether application of a transducer on the anterior fontanelle during cranial ultrasound (US) examination effects cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation in preterm infants. Study design*: During cranial US examination, changes in cerebral blood oxygenation (cHbD) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) were assessed using near infrared spectrophotometry (NIRS) in 76 infants (GA 30.7 (4.1) wk, BW 1423 (717) g) within two days after birth. Ten of these infants (GA 29.1 (1.6) wk, BW 1092 (455) g) were studied again at a postnatal age of one week. Results*: We obtained stable and consistent NIRS registrations in 54 infants within the first two days after birth. Twenty-eight of these infants showed a decrease in cHbD (0.59 (0.54) $\mu$mol/100 g) during the scanning procedure while CBV did not change. Twenty-four infants showed no changes in NIRS and 2 infants showed an atypical NIRS response during cranial US examination. At the postnatal age of one week, stable and consistent NIRS registrations were obtained in 7 infants. None of these infants showed changes in NIRS variables during cranial US examination. Conclusions: Application of an US transducer on the anterior fontanelle causes changes in cerebral oxygenation and hemodynamics in a substantial number of preterm infants.

abstract = {Regular exposure to uninterrupted prolonged sitting and the consumption of high glycemic meals (HGI) is independently associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. Sitting for as little as 1-hour can impair the health of both peripheral and central arteries. However, it is currently unknown whether combined acute exposure to uninterrupted prolonged sitting and a HGI meal is more detrimental to global (peripheral and central) vascular health. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of prolonged sitting (3 hours), following the consumption of a HGI or low glycemic index (LGI) meal, on global pulse wave velocity (G-PWV). METHODS: Eighteen healthy participants (70% female, mean standard deviation [SD] age: 22.6 [3.1] years old, BMI: 25.5 [6.1] kg/m 2 ) sat for 3 hours after consuming a HGI or LGI meal. G-PWV was assessed by incorporating three PWV measures (carotid-femoral, brachial-femoral, femoral-ankle). The effects of time (PRE vs. POST) and condition (LGI vs. HGI) were analyzed using linear mixed models. RESULTS: Following prolonged sitting, G-PWV increased by 0.29 m/s (i.e., PRE vs. POST). However, the condition (P=0.987) and time x condition (P=0.954) effects were non-significant. DISCUSSION: The current findings support previous research showing an increase in arterial stiffness with prolonged sitting. However, in young and healthy adults, the arterial stiffness response was not worsened through HGI consumption.},

abstract = {Purpose: Resting-state functional connectivity in subjects with cerebral infarction (CI) was assessed using wavelet-based coherence analysis of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) signals. Methods: Continuous recordings of NIRS signals were measured from the prefrontal cortex and sensorimotor cortical areas of 12 subjects with CI (CI group) and 16 healthy subjects (healthy group) during the resting state. The channels in these areas were divided into four connection types: homologous connectivity, frontoposterior connectivity, contralateral connectivity, and homolateral connectivity. Wavelet coherence (WCO) and wavelet phase coherence (WPCO) were calculated in six frequency intervals in each channel pair: I, 0.62 Hz; II, 0.1450.6 Hz; III, 0.0520.145 Hz; IV, 0.0210.052 Hz; V, 0.00950.021 Hz; and VI, 0.0050.0095 Hz. Results: WCO in the six frequency intervals was significant for all channels in the healthy group. By contrast, WCO in frequency intervals IIVI showed weakened connectivity in the CI group, especially in terms of frontoposterior connectivity. WCO was significantly lower in the CI group than in the healthy group in the following connectivities and frequency intervals: front-posterior, IVVI (p < 0.05); homologous, IIIV (p < 0.01); motor-contralateral, IIIV (p < 0.05); and motorhomolateral, IIIV (p < 0.05). WPCO in frequency intervals III (F = 5.032, p = 0.033) and IV (F = 11.95, p = 0.002) in frontoposterior connectivity, as well as in intervals IIIV in homologous, motor-contralateral and motor-homolateral connectivities were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the CI group than in the healthy group. However, WPCO in interval I showed significantly higher levels in motor-homolateral connectivity in the CI group than in the healthy group (F = 4.241, p = 0.049). Conclusions: The authors results suggest that CI causes a frequency-specific disruption in restingstate connectivity. This may be useful for assessing the effectiveness of functional recovery after CI.},

abstract = {Objective: The objective of the present study is to investigate if changes in the oxygen saturation of masseter muscle during a chewing task can differentiate patients with myogenic temporomandibular disorders (TMD) from healthy subjects and if these differences are related to the gravity of the disorder and to the orofacial myofunctional status. Materials and methods: Twelve women with moderate TMD (TMD group; 37 ± 16 years) and ten healthy control women (CTRL group 24 ± 5 years) participated. Validated protocols were used to evaluate the severity of TMD and the orofacial myofunctional status. Oxygen saturation in the masseter muscle was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during unilateral chewing of a silicon device. Data were compared using Student's t test, Mann-Whitney test, and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Results: The women of the TMD group showed higher total score of severity of symptoms of TMD, lower total score of the orofacial myofunctional status, and lower oxygen extraction capacity during mastication than healthy control subjects (p < 0.01). Moreover, percentage O2 extraction was significantly related to the severity of signs/symptoms of TMD and of orofacial myofunctional disorders (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Women with TMD had a lower muscle oxygen extraction capacity than healthy subjects: the higher the signs and symptoms' severity, the lower the O2 extraction. NIRS proposes as an important instrumental method to assess the metabolic alterations in the muscles of patients with TMD. Clinical relevance: The findings could be useful to complement clinical assessments, favoring the diagnosis and providing extra data for planning the rehabilitation of TMD patients, especially those with associated myofunctional orofacial disorders.},

Resting energy expenditure, substrate metabolism, skin temperature, thermal comfort perception, superficial muscle activity, hemodynamics of the forearm and abdominal regions, and heart rate variability were measured under warm conditions (22.7 ± 0.2C) and during an individualized cooling protocol (air-conditioning and water cooling vest) in a cold room (19.4 ± 0.1C). The temperature of the cooling vest started at 16.6C and decreased $\sim$ 1.4C every 10 minutes until participants shivered (93.5 ± 26.3 min). All measurements were analysed across 4 periods: warm period, at 31% and at 64% of individual´s cold exposure time until shivering occurred, and at the shivering threshold. Energy expenditure increased from warm period to 31% of cold exposure by 16.7% (P = 0.078) and to the shivering threshold by 31.7% (P = 0.023). Fat oxidation increased by 72.6% from warm period to 31% of cold exposure (P = 0.004), whereas no changes occurred in carbohydrates oxidation. As shivering came closer, the skin temperature and thermal comfort perception decreased (all P<0.05), except in the supraclavicular skin temperature, which did not change (P>0.05). Furthermore, the superficial muscle activation increased at the shivering threshold. It is noteworthy that the largest physiological changes occurred during the first 30 minutes of cold exposure, when the participants felt less discomfort.},

abstract = {Background: Continuous wave near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can monitor chromophore change in the bladder detrusor muscle during voiding; oxygenation and hemodynamic data derived differ in health and disease. Application of wireless NIRS for evaluation of voiding dysfunction would benefit children. Methods: Subjects: 20 children (4-17 yrs) [5 normal, 15 with urinary tract pathology]. Instrumentation: self-contained device weight 84 gm; 3 paired light emitting diodes (760/850 nm) in a spatially resolved configuration; source-detector separation distances (30, 35 and 40 mm); silicon photodiode detector; and Bluetooth{\textregistered}. Procedure: Transcutaneous monitoring (midline abdominal skin 2 cm above pubis) during spontaneous voiding (bladder contraction) of oxygenated (O2Hb), deoxygenated (HHb) and total hemoglobin (tHb) and tissue oxygen saturation index (TSI %) at 10 Hz. Results: All 20 trials produced clear graphic data with no movement effect evident. Comparison of patterns of chromophore change between normal and symptomatic subjects revealed trend differences in O2Hb and tHb. (Normal positive; Symptomatic negative, and TSI% fell in symptomatic group). Conclusions: Wireless NIRS is technically feasible in ambulant children. Negative trends in chromophore concentration and falls in TSI% suggest a hemodynamic impairment may underlie some forms of voiding dysfunction, with abnormal physiology involving the microcirculation possibly resulting in muscle fatigue during voiding. {\textcopyright} 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.},

abstract = {Objectives Repetitive strain injury [RSI] is a multi-factorial overuse syndrome that has been associated with local vascular and muscular impairments. Recently, we found vascular changes also in the non-affected site, which is suggestive for systemic changes in RSI. Whether RSI is associated with systemic changes in muscle function is unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine muscular function in the lower limb of patient with upper limb RSI.Methods Ten patients with RSI [including complaints in the forearm] and 10 healthy normal control subjects participated in the study. Local oxygen consumption of the forearm muscles was examined at baseline and after exercise using near-infrared spectroscopy. Quadriceps muscle contractile properties were examined using isometric contractions and electrical stimulations.Results Patients with RSI demonstrated a lower oxygen consumption in the forearm muscles after exercise [P0.05], indicative for localized muscular changes, and a leftward shifted force frequency relationship [analysis of variance, group-effect: P0.02] in the quadriceps muscle. These contractile properties point in the direction of a larger amount of type II fibers in the quadriceps muscle of patients with RSI.Conclusions These findings suggest that the unaffected quadriceps muscles of patients with upper limb RSI probably demonstrate a predominance for type II fibers. Whether this reflects a systemic predisposition for subjects to be prone to develop RSI has to be elucidated. {\textcopyright} 2012 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.},

Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a promising approach to study the presumed contribution of dysfunction within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to such difficulties. In this pilot study, we examined the feasibility of using a new portable and wireless fNIRS device to measure PFC activity during different dual task walking protocols in PD. Specifically, we tested whether PD patients were able to perform the protocol and whether we were able to measure the typical fNIRS signal of neuronal activity. Methods: We included 14 PD patients (age 71.2 ± 5.4 years, Hoehn and Yahr stage II/III). The protocol consisted of five repetitions of three conditions: walking while (i) counting forwards, (ii) serially subtracting, and (iii) reciting digit spans. Ability to complete this protocol, perceived exertion, burden of the fNIRS devices, and concentrations of oxygenated (O2Hb) and deoxygenated (HHb) hemoglobin from the left and right PFC were measured. Results: Two participants were unable to complete the protocol due to fatigue and mobility safety concerns. The remaining 12 participants experienced no burden from the two fNIRS devices and completed the protocol with ease. Bilateral PFC O2Hb concentrations increased during walking while serially subtracting (left PFC 0.46 $\mu$mol/L, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.12-0.81, right PFC 0.49 $\mu$mol/L, 95 % CI 0.14-0.84) and reciting digit spans (left PFC 0.36 $\mu$mol/L, 95 % CI 0.03-0.70, right PFC 0.44 $\mu$mol/L, 95 % CI 0.09-0.78) when compared to rest. HHb concentrations did not differ between the walking tasks and rest. Conclusions: These findings suggest that a new wireless fNIRS device is a feasible measure of PFC activity in PD during dual task walking. Future studies should reduce the level of noise and inter-individual variability to enable measuring differences in PFC activity between different dual walking conditions and across health states.},

abstract = {Whole-body vibration (WBV) is currently used to enhance performance and treat injuries even though we lack an understanding of how WBV influences physiological processes. An improved understanding of the physiological effects of WBV could lead to protocols to speed healing or treat pathologies. This study examined the acute effects of WBV on peripheral blood perfusion, muscle oxygenation, motoneuron pool excitability, and sensory nerve conduction velocity. Fourteen healthy participants [9 women (21.7±2.4years); 5 men (20.8±1.1years)] completed a 5min bout of WBV (50Hz, 2mm amplitude). Measures were assessed pre-treatment and at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20min post-treatment. WBV significantly increased superficial skin temperature (P<0.0005) and total hemoglobin (P=0.009), had no effect of oxyhemoglobin (P=0.186), increased deoxyhemoglobin (P<0.0005), inhibited the soleus Hoffmann reflex (P=0.007), and had no effect on sural sensory nerve conduction velocity (P=0.695). These results suggest that an acute bout of WBV influences physiological processes in both the circulatory and the nervous systems. {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.},

abstract = {Purpose: Topical application of nonivamide–nicoboxil cream to resting legs has been shown to enhance the level of oxygenated haemoglobin in leg muscles 15 min later. Here, we examined whether such application improves the performance of experienced cyclists in a subsequent 4-km time-trial. Methods: Nine male cyclists [26 ± 8 years; 176 ± 9 cm; 73.5 ± 12.8 kg; peak oxygen uptake: 50.7 ± 4.0 mL min−1 kg−1 (mean ± SD)] performed three 4-km time-trials on an ergometer with either topical application of nonivamide–nicoboxil cream (CREAM) or cream without active components (SHAM) to both their thigh muscles or no application (CONTROL). Results: Only the skin temperature immediately before and after the time-trial was higher with cream than SHAM and CONTROL (best p < 0.001, best d = 1.16). All other parameters evaluated, i.e., the average power output during the time-trial (p > 0.05, best d = 0.08), the tissue saturation index of the m. vastus lateralis (p > 0.05, best d = 0.57), cardiac output, heart rate, oxygen uptake, blood lactate concentration, and perceived exertion (p > 0.05, best d = 1.1) were similar under all three conditions. Conclusions: Our present findings reveal that topical application of cream containing nonivamide and nicoboxil to the thighs of cyclists prior to a 4-km time-trial does not improve their power output, saturation of the m. vastus lateralis with oxygen, oxygen uptake, heart rate, cardiac parameters, or perceived level of exertion.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to compare and evaluate the effectiveness of three protocols of intermittent exposure to simulated altitude (hypobaric hypoxia). This was done in order to determine the shortest protocol in which hematological changes were induced. In addition to having some potential therapeutic applications, these protocols have also been used to pre-acclimation of climbers to altitude, and to improve the performance capacity of athletes. These applications are supported by the available evidence that living in hypoxia while training in normoxia is probably more effective than training and living in hypoxia. Three protocols of different duration (days) and exposure (hours) at a simulated altitude of 4,000-5,500m (462-379 Torr) were compared (Protocol A: 17 days and 60 hours; Protocol B: 9 days and 31 hours; and Protocol C: 21 days and 14 hours). The three experimental procedures showed to effectively elicit a significant increase (p<0.05) in packed cell volume (mean increase = 6.6% to 12.6%), hemoglobin concentration (mean increase = 14.7% to 18.7%), red blood cell counts (mean increase = 7.7% to 13.7%), and reticulocyte count (mean increase = 120% to 180%). We conclude that the three protocols we used for intermittent exposure to hypobaric hypoxia effectively elicited hematological adaptative responses. However, protocol B (9 consecutive days, 3-4 h/d) shows to be the most efficient per day of exposure, in terms of hematological adaptation, followed by protocol C (21 alternate day sessions, 1.5 h/d), most efficient in terms of total time (per hours of exposure). Nevertheless, it may be the time availability of the subjects and/or the facility, which will ultimately determine the model of exposure that is chosen.},

abstract = {Hypoxia and exercise each exhibit opposing effects on executive function, and the mechanisms for this are not entirely clear. This study examined the influence of cerebral oxygenation and perfusion on executive function during exercise and recovery in normobaric hypoxia (NH) and normoxia (N). METHODS: There were 18 subjects who completed cycling trials in NH (12.5% FIo2) and N (20.93% FIo2). Right prefrontal cortex (PFC) oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb) and middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAbv) were collected during executive function challenges [mathematical processing and running memory continuous performance task (RMCPT)] at baseline, following 30 min of acclimation, during 20 min of cycling (60% V˙ o2max), and at 1, 15, 30, and 45 min following exercise. RESULTS: Results indicated effects of time for Math, RMCPT, and O2Hb; but not for MCAbv. Results also indicated effects of condition for O2Hb. Math scores were improved by 8.0% during exercise and remained elevated at 30 min of recovery (12.5%), RMCPT scores significantly improved at all time points (7.5-11.9%), and O2Hb increased by 662.2% and 440.9% during exercise in N and NH, respectively, and remained elevated through 15 min of recovery in both conditions. DISCUSSION: These results support the influence of PFC oxygenation and perfusion on executive function during exercise and recovery in N and NH.},

abstract = {Background: In the ICU, out-of-bed rehabilitation is often delayed and in-bed exercises are generally low-intensity. Since the majority of rehabilitation is carried out in bed, it is essential to carry out the exercises that have the highest intensity. The aim of this study was to compare the physiological effects of four common types of bed exercise in intubated, sedated patients confined to bed in the ICU, in order to determine which was the most intensive. Methods: A randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial was carried out to evaluate the effects of four bed exercises (passive range of movements (PROM), passive cycle-ergometry, quadriceps electrical stimulation and functional electrical stimulation (FES) cycling) on cardiac output. Each exercise was carried out for ten minutes in ventilated, sedated patients. Cardiac output was recorded using cardiac Doppler ultrasound. The secondary aims were to evaluate right heart function and pulmonary and systemic artery pressures during the exercises, and the microcirculation of the vastus lateralis muscle. Results: The results were analysed in 19 patients. FES cycling was the only exercise that increased cardiac output, with a mean increase of 1 L/min (15%). There was a concomitant increase in muscle oxygen uptake, suggesting that muscle work occurred. FES cycling thus constitutes an effective early rehabilitation intervention. No muscle or systemic effects were induced by the passive techniques. Conclusion: Most bed exercises were low-intensity and induced low levels of muscle work. FES cycling was the only exercise that increased cardiac output and produced sufficient intensity of muscle work. Longer-term studies of the effect of FES cycling on functional outcomes should be carried out.},

abstract = {Purpose Sickle cell disease (SCD) patients exhibit a limited exercise tolerance commonly attributed to anaemia, as well as hemorheological and cardio-respiratory abnormalities, but the functional status of skeletal muscle at exercise is unknown. Moreover, the effect of SCD genotype on exercise tolerance and skeletal muscle function has been poorly investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate skeletal muscle function and fatigue during a submaximal exercise in SCD patients. Methods Nineteen healthy individuals (AA), 28 patients with sickle cell anaemia (SS) and 18 with sickle cell-haemoglobin C disease (SC) performed repeated knee extensions exercise (FAT). Maximal isometric torque (Tmax) was measured before and after the FAT to quantify muscle fatigability. Electromyographic activity and oxygenation by near-infrared spectroscopy of the Vastus Lateralis were recorded. Results FAT caused a reduction in Tmax in SS (− 17.0 ± 12.1%, p < 0.001) and SC (− 21.5 ± 14.5%, p < 0.05) but not in AA (+ 0.58 ± 29.9%). Root-mean-squared value of EMG signal (RMS) decreased only in SS after FAT, while the median power frequency (MPF) was unchanged in all groups. Oxygenation kinetics were determined in SS and AA and were not different. Conclusion These results show skeletal muscle dysfunction during exercise in SCD patients, and suggest different fatigue aetiology between SS and SC. The changes in EMG signal and oxygenation kinetics during exercise suggest that the greater skeletal muscle fatigue occurring in SCD patients would be rather due to intramuscular alterations modifications than decreased tissue oxygenation. Moreover, SS patients exhibit greater muscle fatigability than SC.},

abstract = {Wireless wearable functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has attracted growing attention as a candidate for real-life brain monitoring systems. It is important to determine the onsets at which neuronal activation is evoked by cognitive status in real-time analysis. We propose a machine learning approach for the classification of cognitive event onsets (CogEOs) in hemodynamic signals during three cognitive tasks. The approach does not require a threshold to be set or additional measurement for the rest state. A support vector machine is trained by labeled features obtained from the mean amplitude of hemodynamic changes and then predicts the type of onset points. The problems caused by the imbalance between CogEOs and non-event onsets (NonEO) are solved by oversampling the feature samples labeled by cognitive events. By oversampling, the classification accuracy from an average of five classification scores reaches 74%, 77%, and 75% for the simple arithmetic, 1-back, and 2-back tasks. We achieve the best onset classification performance when the NonEOs are randomly distributed and when the subject is performing the 1-back task. Our study extends fNIRS to real-life applications by detecting the time point when brain activation starts among random observations using machine learning without additional triggers or threshold.},

Twelve healthy males received 6 g of L-citrulline or placebo in a double-blind crossover design. Pulmonary function (i.e., forced expired volume in 1 s, forced vital capacity and their ratio), maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), fractional exhaled nitric oxide (NO•), and sternocleidomastoid muscle oxygenation were measured at baseline, one hour post supplementation, and after an incremental resistive breathing protocol to task failure of the respiratory muscles. The resistive breathing task consisted of 30 inspirations at 70% and 80% of MIP followed by continuous inspirations at 90% of MIP until task failure. Sternocleidomastoid muscle oxygenation was assessed using near-infrared spectroscopy. One-hour post-L-citrulline supplementation, exhaled NO• was significantly increased (19.2%; p < 0.05), and this increase was preserved until the end of the resistive breathing (16.4%; p < 0.05). In contrast, no difference was observed in the placebo condition. Pulmonary function and MIP were not affected by the L-citrulline supplementation. During resistive breathing, sternocleidomastoid muscle oxygenation was significantly reduced, with no difference noted between the two supplementation conditions. In conclusion, a single ingestion of 6 g L-citrulline increased NO• bioavailability but not the respiratory performance and inspiratory muscle oxygenation.},

abstract = {Background: While the number of people with hypertension (HBP) continues to increase, the therapeutic target for optimal blood pressure (BP) has been revised to a lower level. Studies have suggested that High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) could be as efficient as BP-lowering drugs, but no study has compared their efficacy in a randomized trial. The aim of this protocol is to determine if HIIT is as efficient as Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in lowering 24 h ambulatory BP in prehypertensive older adults. Moreover, the secondary aim is to determine if HIIT is associated with greater cardiovascular and cognitive benefits than HCTZ. Methods: This study is an interventional, single-center, non-inferiority trial, with two randomized parallel groups of prehypertensive participants aged 60 years or more. One group will be prescribed daily doses of 12.5 mg of HCTZ for 12 weeks, and the other group will follow thrice-weekly HIIT for 12 weeks. Each group will be composed of 30 participants. The primary outcome is 24 h ambulatory BP. Secondary outcomes are scores on neuropsychological assessments, balance and gait performances, maximal oxygen uptake, peripheral endothelial function, and arterial stiffness. Non-inferiority tests will be performed on the primary outcome, and secondary outcomes will be compared using independent t-tests. Conclusion: This study will determine if HIIT is at least as efficient as HCTZ in lowering BP in prehypertensive older adults. This study will also determine if HIIT provides greater benefits in terms of cardiovascular and cognitive status (NCT04103411).},

abstract = {Background Circulating progenitor cells (CPCs) improve cardiovascular function and organ perfusion by enhancing the capacities of endothelial repair and neovasculogenesis. This study investigates whether exercise regimens with/without hypoxia affect cardiac and muscular hemodynamics by modulating CPCs and angiogenic factors. Methods Forty sedentary males were randomly divided into hypoxic (HT, n = 20) and normoxic (NT, n = 20) training groups. The subjects were trained on a bicycle ergometer at 60%VO2max under 15% (HT) or 21% (NT) O2 conditions for 30 min daily, five days weekly for five weeks. Results After the five-week interventions, the HT group exhibited a larger improvement in aerobic capacity than the NT group. Furthermore, the HT regimen (i) enhanced cardiac output (QH) and perfusion (Q M)/oxygenation of vastus lateralis during exercise; (ii) increased levels of CD34+/KDR+/CD117+, CD34 +/KDR+/CD133+, and CD34+/KDR +/CD31+ cells in blood; (iii) promoted the proliferative capacity of these CPC subsets, and (iv) elevated plasma nitrite/nitrate, stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) concentrations. Despite the lack of changes in QH and the number or proliferative capacity of CD34 +/KDR+/CD117+ or CD34+/KDR +/CD31+ cells, the NT regimen elevated both QM and plasma nitrite/nitrate levels and suppressed the shedding of endothelial cells (CD34-/KDR+/phosphatidylserine+ cells). Conclusions The HT regimen improves cardiac and muscular hemodynamic adaptations, possibly by promoting the mobilization/function of CPCs and the production of angiogenic factors. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: In patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) with isolated exertional desaturation, there are limited data regarding the effectiveness of oxygen supplementation during exercise training; the underlying mechanisms that contribute to these responses are unknown. Objectives: To examine in these IPF patients the effects of oxygen supplementation during submaximal exercise (vs. medical air) on cerebral/skeletal muscle oxygenation and systemic hemodynamics. Methods: In this randomized, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial, IPF patients (n = 13; 63.4 ± 9.6 years) without resting hypoxemia but a significant desaturation during maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing underwent 2 steady-state exercise trials (65% peak-work-load), breathing either oxygen-enriched or medical air. Cerebral/skeletal muscle oxygenation (near-infrared spectroscopy) and beat-by-beat hemodynamics (photoplethysmography) were monitored. Results: In the air protocol, from the initial minutes of submaximal exercise, patients exhibited a marked decline in cerebral oxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb) and an abrupt rise in deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb). Oxygen supplementation alleviated desaturation, lessened dyspnea, and prolonged exercise duration (p < 0.01). Oxygen supplementation during exercise (i) attenuated cerebral deoxygenation (cerebral-HHb: 0.7 ± 1.9 vs. 2.5 ± 1.5 $\mu$mol/L, O2 and air protocol; p = 0.009) and prevented cerebral-Hbdifference decline (2.1 ± 2.7 vs. −1.7 ± 2.0 $\mu$mol/L; p = 0.001), (ii) lessened the decline in muscle O2-saturation index, and (iii) at isotime exercise, it resulted in lower muscle-HHb (p = 0.05) and less leg fatigue (p < 0.05). No differences between protocols were observed in exercise cardiac output and vascular resistance. Conclusions: IPF patients with isolated exertional hypoxemia exhibit an inability to increase/maintain cerebral oxygenation during submaximal exercise. Correcting desaturation with O2 supplementation prevented the decline in brain oxygenation, improved muscle oxygenation, and lessened dyspnea, suggesting an efficacy of acute oxygen supplementation during exercise training in protecting brain hypoxia in these IPF patients.},

abstract = {Introduction: The ability to walk safely and independently is a fundamental component of daily living activities. Walking while dual tasking and obstacle negotiation are two tasks that have been used to investigate walking in complex situations. Deficits in cognitive domains and sensory-motor processes associated with aging and neurodegeneration impair the ability to successfully assess the environment and react to it. These changes in the ability to walk are modulated via neural circuits. However, the actual neural circuits of the brain involved in the control of locomotion in different challenging situations are still poorly understood. Methods: Two groups of subjects; 20 healthy older adults (mean age 69.7±1.3 yrs, 50% females) and 47 persons with PD (mean age 71.7±1.1 yrs, 32% females) were studied. The protocol included real and imagined walking while negotiating obstacles and dual tasking. Walking conditions were performed while being monitored with fNIRS and imagined walking were assessed in the MR scanner. A repeated measures design (condition x group) was conducted with two levels; within group and between groups. Results: Significant differences in brain activation were observed in the fMRI and fNIRS. Between groups comparison showed that persons with PD had a significantly higher activation in frontal, parietal, occipital, and cerebellum regions during usual walking compared to healthy older adults (p<0.048). Comparison between the walking tasks within each group revealed (1) increased activation during walking while negotiating obstacles in both groups (p<0.023) and (2) increased activation during walking while dual tasking only in healthy older adults (p<0.035). Correlations between brain activation and performance in motor-cognitive tests were found in both groups however, healthy older adults presented inverse correlation and persons with PD positive correlation. Conclusions: These findings indicate that subjects with PD activate larger brain areas than healthy older adults even during usual walking. Perhaps, this increased activation is a compensatory strategy to enhance performance. The increased activation already during usual walking task may limit the ability to increase activation or recruit additional brain areas during the more complex walking tasks and may contribute to the high prevalence of falls and the dual tasking difficulty in persons with PD.},

abstract = {Purpose: Cerebral oxygenation as measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) might be useful to discriminate between physiological and pathological responses after standing up in individuals with orthostatic hypotension. This study addressed the physiological sensitivity of the cerebral oxygenation responses as measured by NIRS to different types and speeds of postural changes in healthy adults and assessed the reliability of these responses. Methods: Cerebral oxygenated hemoglobin (O 2 Hb), deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb) and tissue saturation index (TSI) were measured bilaterally on the forehead of 15 healthy individuals (12 male, age range 18–27) using NIRS. Participants performed three repeats of sit to stand, and slow and rapid supine to stand movements. Responses were defined as the difference between mean, minimum and maximum O 2 Hb, HHb and TSI values after standing up and baseline. Test–retest, interobserver and intersensor reliabilities were addressed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Results: The minimum O 2 Hb response was most sensitive to postural changes and showed significant differences (− 4.09 µmol/L, p < 0.001) between standing up from sitting and supine position, but not between standing up at different speeds (− 0.31 µmol/L, p = 0.70). The minimum O 2 Hb response was the most reliable parameter (ICC > 0.6). Conclusions: In healthy individuals, NIRS-based cerebral oxygenation parameters are sensitive to postural change and discriminate between standing up from supine and sitting position with minimum O 2 Hb response as the most sensitive and reliable parameter. The results underpin the potential value for future clinical use of NIRS in individuals with orthostatic hypotension.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Previous studies have used near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to measure skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity. This study tested the hypothesis that NIRS-measured mitochondrial capacity would improve with endurance exercise training and decline with detraining. METHODS: Nine young participants performed 4 wk of progressively increasing endurance exercise training of the wrist flexor muscles followed by approximately 5 wk of inactivity. The rate of recovery of muscle oxygen consumption (mV̇O2) was measured with NIRS every 3-7 d, indicating mitochondrial oxidative capacity. RESULTS: A linear increase in mitochondrial capacity (NIRS rate constant) was found with a group average of 64% ± 37% improvement after 4 wk of exercise training (P < 0.05). Mitochondrial capacity declined exponentially upon cessation of exercise training, with a mean half-time of approximately 7.7 d. CONCLUSIONS: Both the magnitude and the time course of mitochondrial adaptations to exercise training and detraining measured with NIRS was consistent with previous studies using both in vitro and in vivo techniques. These findings show that NIRS-based measurements can detect meaningful changes in mitochondrial capacity. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 by the American College of Sports Medicine.},

abstract = {Introduction: In this study we noninvasively evaluated skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity, muscle-specific endurance, and energy/fatigue feelings in persons with Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) and able-bodied controls (AB). Methods: Forearm mitochondrial capacity was measured in FRDA (n = 16) and AB (n = 10) study participants using the rate of recovery of oxygen consumption after electrical stimulation with near-infrared spectroscopy. Mechanomyography (MMG) assessed muscle endurance after electrical stimulation for 3 minutes at 2 Hz, 4 Hz, and 6 Hz. Validated scales assessed disease severity and energy/fatigue feelings. Results: Groups did not differ in mitochondrial capacity (FRDA and AB: 1.8 ± 0.3 L/min). The difference in muscle endurance at 6 Hz was lower by 19.2% in the FRDA group (group effect: P < 0.001). Feelings of physical energy were 34% lower in FRDA group. In FDRA muscle, endurance was positively related to mitochondrial capacity (r = 0.59, P = 0.03), and disease severity was negatively related to mitochondrial capacity (r = –0.55, P = 0.04) and muscle endurance (r = –0.60, P = 0.01). Conclusion: Non-invasive measures of skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity and muscle-specific endurance are useful in monitoring FRDA. Muscle Nerve 56: 773–779, 2017.},

@article{Stocker2018,
abstract = {Blood flow (BF) in exercising muscles is an important factor for exercise capacity. Recently, a non-invasive method to estimate capillary BF (Qcap) was introduced. Using this method, the Fick principle is re-arranged by using relative differences in deoxygenated haemoglobin ($\Delta$HHb) as a surrogate for arteriovenous O2 difference and pulmonary oxygen uptake (VO2) instead of muscular oxygen uptake. The aim of this study was to examine (I) the relationship between Qcap and exercise intensity during and following exercise, and (II) to critically reflect the Qcap approach. Seventeen male subjects completed six bouts of cycling exercise with different exercise intensities (40–90% peak oxygen uptake, VO2peak) in randomized order. VO2 and $\Delta$HHb were monitored continuously during the trail. Qcap was modelled bi-exponentially, and mean response time (MRT) was calculated during recovery as well as the dissociation of modelled VO2 and Qcap recovery kinetics (MRT/$\tau$VO2). End-exercise Qcap increased continuously with exercise intensity. This also applied to MRT. Postexercise MRT/$\tau$VO2 increased from 40 to 60% VO2peak but remained stable thereafter. The results show that Qcap response to exercise is linearly related to exercise intensity. This is presumably due to vasoactive factors like shear-stress or endothelial-mediated vasodilation. MRT/$\tau$VO2 shows that postexercise Qcap is elevated for a longer period than VO2, which is representative for metabolic demand following exercise ≥70% VO2peak. This is a hint for prolonged local vasodilation. According to previous studies, Qcap could not be modelled properly in some cases, which is a limitation to the method and therefore has to be interpreted with caution.},
