	abstract = {Background Individuals with coronary heart disease (CHD) exhibit cognitive deficits and cerebrovascular dysfunctions, and are at higher risk of developing dementia. Cognitive function in individuals with CHD has never been studied during acute aerobic exercise. Given the increasing popularity of training at high peak power output (PPO), its impact on cerebrovascular and cognitive functions in individuals with CHD should be further studied. Method Thirty-eight individuals with CHD and 16 healthy controls completed two exercise bouts at 30\% and 70\% of their individualized PPO on an ergocycle while performing a cognitive task including non-executive and executive conditions. Variations of oxy- deoxy-hemoglobin, and total hemoglobin concentrations were measured on left prefrontal cortex at both PPO using near-infrared spectroscopy. Results Cognitive task performances were equivalent between groups at all intensity levels. Individuals with CHD exhibited larger variation of deoxyhemoglobin in the executive condition and larger variation in total hemoglobin concentration in all task conditions compared to healthy controls at 70\% of PPO. Conclusion Exercising at high intensity seems to have a larger impact on cerebral blood volume in CHD patients compared to healthy age-matched controls. Higher exercise intensity has negative impacts on cerebral blood volume variations during a cognitive task in CHD patients and could potentially lead to other neurocognitive dysfunctions. Other studies are needed to determine if a cognitive task administered during an exercise test could help identify individuals with CHD at higher risk of developing cognitive decline.},

	abstract = {The aim was to investigate the potential differences in muscle (vastus lateralis) and cerebral (prefrontal cortex) oxygenation levels as well as in the number of repetitions and total work output between isokinetic eccentric and concentric exercise at a moderate relative intensity until exhaustion. Ten recreationally active young men underwent two isokinetic exercise sessions either concentric or eccentric, one on each randomly selected leg. The protocols were performed at 60°/s and an intensity corresponding to 60\% of the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of each contraction type. Concentric torque was significantly lower compared to eccentric torque in both peak values and at values corresponding to 60\% of MVC [230 ± 18 Nm vs. 276 ± 19 Nm (P = .014) and 137 ± 12 Nm vs. 168 ± 11 Nm, respectively (P = .010)]. The participants performed 40\% more contractions during eccentric compared to concentric exercise [122 ± 15 vs. 78 ± 7, respectively]. No differences were found in the levels of oxyhaemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, total haemoglobin and tissue saturation index when eccentric and eccentric exercise regimes were compared (all P {\textgreater} .05). Our results demonstrate that eccentric exercise of moderate intensity leads to greater resistance to fatigue and more work output compared to concentric exercise, despite the comparable muscle and cerebral oxygenation levels.},

	abstract = {Patients palliated with Total Cavopulmonary Connection have a lower muscle mass and a lower exercise capacity. We assessed calf muscle oxidative metabolism during and after heel raise exercise to exhaustion in young patients with TCPC compared to healthy peers. Near-infrared spectroscopy was used for measuring oxygen metabolism in the medial portion of the gastrocnemius muscle. Forty-three patients with TCPC, aged 6–18 years, were compared with 43 age and sex-matched healthy control subjects. Subgroups were formed to include children (6–12 years) and adolescents (13–18 years) to determine if these age groups influenced the results. During exercise, for the patients compared to controls there was a lower increase in deoxygenated hemoglobin (oxygen extraction) (5.13 ± 2.99au vs. 7.75 ± 4.15au, p = 0.001) and a slower rate of change in total hemoglobin (blood volume) (0.004 ± 0.015au vs 0.016 ± 0.01au, p = 0.001). Following exercise, patients exhibited a slower initial increase in tissue oxygenation saturation index (0.144 ± 0.11au vs 0.249 ± 0.226au, p = 0.007) and a longer half-time to maximum hyperemia (23.7 ± 11.4 s vs 16.8 ± 7.5 s, p = 0.001). On the subgroup level, the adolescents differed compared to healthy peers, whereas the children did not. Young patients with TCPC had impaired oxidative metabolism during exercise and required a longer time to recover. In that the differences were seen in the adolescent group and not in the children group may indicate a declining function with age.},

	abstract = {Aim: The aim of the current study was to assess whether executive function and prefrontal oxygenation are dependent on fitness level and age in older adults. Methods: Twenty-four healthy males aged between 55 and 69 years old were recruited for this study. They were stratified by age, leading to the creation of two groups: 55–60 years old and 61–69 years old. A median split based on CRF created higher- and lower-fit categories of participants. Cerebral oxygenation was assessed using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during a computerized Stroop task. Accuracy (\% of correct responses) and reaction times (ms) were used as behavioural indicators of cognitive performances. Changes in oxygenated (∆[HbO2]) and deoxygenated (∆[HHb]) hemoglobin were measured to capture neural changes. Repeated measures ANOVAs (CRF × Age × Stroop conditions) were performed to test the null hypothesis of an absence of interaction between CRF, Age and executive performance. Results: We also found an interaction between CRF and age on reaction times (p = .001), in which higher fitness levels were related to faster reaction times in the 61–69 year olds but not in the 55–60 year olds. Regarding ΔHHb, the ANOVA revealed a main effect of CRF in the right PFC (p = .04), in which higher-fit participants had a greater Δ[HHb] than the lower-fit (d = 1.5). We also found fitness by age interaction for Δ[HHb] in the right PFC (p = .04). Conclusion: Our results support the positive association of CRF on cerebral oxygenation and Stroop performance in healthy older males. They indicated that high-fit individuals performed better in the 61–69 year olds group, but not in the 55–60 years old group. We also observed a greater PFC oxygenation change (as measured by Δ[HHb]) in the high-fit individuals.},

	abstract = {Background
Muscle wasting is frequent in chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) and associated with low branched-chain amino acids (BCAA). We hypothesized that BCAA supplementation could potentiate the effect of a pulmonary rehabilitation program (PRP) by inducing muscular change.

Materials and methods
Sixty COPD patients (GOLD 2–3) were involved in an ambulatory 4-week PRP either with BCAA oral daily supplementation or placebo daily supplementation in a randomized double-blind design. Maximal exercise test including quadriceps oxygenation measurements, functional exercise test, muscle strength, lung function tests, body composition, dyspnea and quality of life were assessed before and after PRP.

Results
Fifty-four patients (64.9 ± 8.3 years) completed the protocol. In both groups, maximal exercise capacity, functional and muscle performances, quality of life and dyspnea were improved after 4-week PRP (p ≤ 0.01). Changes in muscle oxygenation during the maximal exercise and recovery period were not modified after 4-week PRP in BCAA group. Contrarily, in the placebo group the muscle oxygenation kinetic of recovery was slowed down after PRP.

Conclusion
This study demonstrated that a 4-week PRP with BCAA supplementation is not more beneficial than PRP alone for patients. A longer duration of supplementation or a more precise targeting of patients would need to be investigated to validate an effect on muscle recovery and to demonstrate other beneficial effects.},

	doi = {10.3357/AMHP.5896.2021},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND:
              Aerobatic pilots must withstand high and sudden acceleration forces (G
              z
              ) up to 10 G
              z
              . The physiological consequences of such a succession of high and abrupt positive and negative G
              z
              on the human body over time remain mostly unknown.
 This case report emphasizes changes in physiological factors such as cerebral oxygenation and heart rate dynamics collected in real aerobatic flights.
              CASE REPORT:
              A 37-yr-old man, experienced in aerobatic flying, voluntarily took part in this study. During two flight runs (1520
 min), the pilot performed aerobatic maneuvers with multiple high (10 G
              z
              ) positive and negative accelerations. During the flights he wore a Polar heart rate sensor while cerebral oxygenation was measured continuously over his prefrontal cortex via near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).
 NIRS allows for measurement of the relative concentration changes of oxygenated hemoglobin (O
              2
              Hb) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb), making it possible to determine cerebral oxygenation and hemodynamic status.
              DISCUSSION:
              The continuous in-flight monitoring of O
              2
              Hb
 and HHb revealed the large effects of successive positive and negative G
              z
              exposures on cerebral hemodynamics alterations. The results showed a significant and positive correlation between changes in G
              z
              exposures and O
              2
              Hb concentration. This case report highlights
 that NIRS provides some valuable and sensitive indicators for the monitoring of cerebral hemodynamics during aerobatic flights exposed to multiple and high acceleration forces. To our knowledge, this first study quantifying cerebral oxygenation changes in aerobatics opens the way for the assessment
 of individual physiological responses and tolerance in pilots to repeated high G
              z
              during real flights.

	title = {Age-related differences in muscle microvascular response and muscle oxygen uptake: a near infrared spectroscopy apporach},
	abstract = {Background: Blood flow to the limbs has shown to be significantly reduced in elderly when 
compared to their younger counterparts. The knowledge on the effect of age on microvascular 
function is still limited. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive method which 
can measure skeletal muscle microvascular responsiveness and muscle oxygen uptake.
Although NIRS is thought to be a reliable method there are certain confounders like adipose 
tissue thickness over the muscle and physical fitness that should be considered. Objective:
The main aim of this study was to further investigate if there is a difference in muscle 
microvascular response and muscle oxygen uptake (mVO2) between elderly and young, 
taking into consideration physical performance parameters and adipose tissue thickness 
(ATT). The secondary aim of this study is to investigate the difference between an arterial 
occlusion fixed for time and an arterial occlusion fixed for the level of desaturation, between 
elderly and young. Methodology: A total of 37 participants completed the testing protocols, 
19 young (25±0,5 years) and 18 elderly (69±1,4 years). To measure the participants 
microvascular response and mVO2 two arterial occlusion tests (AOT) were performed, one 
with a fixed duration (AOT10) and one with a fixed desaturation (AOT20). The performance 
parameters measured were peak-incremental dynamic handgrip test (IHT-peak) and whole body peak oxygen uptake (VO2-peak). Results: No difference in microvascular response and 
mVO2 between elderly and young, in the m. vastus lateralis (VL). In the m. flexor digitorum 
superficialis (FDS) there was observed a higher mVO2 for the young group. We found a 
relationship between ATT for both microvascular response and mVO2 in the VL. While in the
FDS there was only observed a relationship between ATT and microvascular reperfusion rate
(RR). We did also find a weak relationship between peak IHT-peak duration and the 
microvascular hyperaemic response (ΔSmO2-max) in the FDS. Our study showed no 
difference in microvascular response and mVO2 between elderly and young when using 
AOT20. While we did observe a difference in microvascular response and muscle oxygen 
uptake between AOT20 and AOT10. Conclusion: We found no difference in microvascular 
response and mVO2 between elderly and young for neither AOT10 nor AOT20. We did 
observe that ATT did affect the NIRS-signals. We found a relationship between IHT-peak 
duration and microvascular hyperaemic response. We did observe a larger microvascular 
response for the AOT10 compared to AOT20.},
