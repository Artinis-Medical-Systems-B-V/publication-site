abstract: 'Purpose To contrast older and younger adults’ prefrontal cortex (PFC) neural
  activity (through changes in oxygenated hemoglobin) during single and dual tasks,
  and to compare decrements in task performance. Methods Changes in oxygenated hemoglobin
  of dorsolateral PFC were monitored using functional near-infrared spectroscopy during
  single tasks of spelling backwards (cognitive task) and 30 m preferred paced walk;
  and a dual task combining both. Gait velocity was measured by a pressure sensitive
  mat. Results Twenty sex-matched younger (27.6 ± 3.5 years) and 17 older adults (71.2
  ± 4.9 years) were recruited. The left PFC oxygenated hemoglobin decreased from start
  (1st quintile) to the end (5th quintile) of the walking task in younger adults (
  – 0.03 ± 0.03 to – 0.72 ± 0.20 µM; p textless .05) unlike the non-significant change
  in older adults (0.03 ± 0.06 to – 0.41 ± 0.32 µM, p textgreater .05). Overall, oxygenation
  increased bilaterally during dual versus single walk task in older adults (Left
  PFC: 0.22 ± 0.16 vs. – 0.23 ± 0.21 µM, respectively; Right PFC: 0.17 ± 0.18 vs.
  – 0.33 ± 0.22 µM, respectively), but only in right PFC in younger adults ( – 0.02
  ± 0.15 vs. – 0.47 ± 0.13 µM). Older adults exhibited lower velocity during the dual
  task compared to younger adults (1.03 ± 0.16 vs. 1.20 ± 0.17 m/s, respectively).
  Older age was associated with dual task cost on velocity during walking after adjusting
  for confounding variables. Conclusions Age-related cognitive decline in older adults
  may increase neural activity for cognitive tasks and diminish walking automaticity
  that may lead to decrements during dual tasking; the greater PFC increases in the
  oxygenated hemoglobin and lower velocity may be due to increased cognitive load
  and limited attentional resources.'
