abstract: Prolonged uninterrupted sitting and a typical Western meal, high in fat
  and refined sugar, can additively impair cognitive and cerebrovascular functions.
  However, it is unknown whether interrupting these behaviours, with a simple desk-based
  activity, can attenuate the impairment. The aim of this study was to determine whether
  regular leg fidgeting can off-set the detrimental effects of prolonged sitting following
  the consumption of a typical Western meal, on executive and cerebrovascular function.
  Using a randomized cross-over design, 13 healthy males consumed a Western meal and
  completed 180-min of prolonged sitting with leg fidgeting of 1 min on/4 min off
  (intervention [INT]) and without (control [CON]). Cognitive function was assessed
  pre and post sitting using the Trail Maker Test (TMT) parts A and B. Common carotid
  artery (CCA) blood flow, as an index of brain flow, was measured pre and post, and
  cerebral (FP1) perfusion was measured continuously. For TMT B the CON trial significantly
  increased (worsened) completion time (mean difference [MD] = 5.2 s, d = 0.38), the
  number of errors (MD = 3.33, d = 0.68) and cognitive fatigue (MD = 0.73, d = 0.92).
  Compared to CON, the INT trial significantly improved completion time (MD = 2.3
  s, d = 0.97), and prevented declines in cognitive fatigue and a reduction in the
  number of errors. No significant changes in cerebral perfusion or CCA blood flow
  were found. Leg fidgeting for 1-min on/4-min off following a meal high in fats and
  refined sugars attenuated the impairment in executive function. This attenuation
  in executive function may not be caused by alterations in CCA blood flow or cerebral
  perfusion.
