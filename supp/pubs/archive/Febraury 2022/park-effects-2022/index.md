abstract: Aim To date, there is a controversy regarding the effects of acute aerobic
  exercise of moderate intensity on executive function and prefrontal cortex activity
  in community-dwelling older adults. This study aimed to investigate the effects
  of acute aerobic exercise of moderate intensity in healthy older adults.  Methods
  Fifty-six healthy older adults were randomly assigned to the experimental group
  (EG) that performed moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or the wait-list control
  group (CG) for a total of 15 sessions. To compare the two groups, the Stroop Color-Word
  Task (SCWT) and the Trail-Making Test Part B (TMT-B) were implemented for executive
  function and prefrontal cortex activity during executive function testing.  Results
  After the intervention, the EG achieved a significant improvement in the SCWT (P
  textless 0.001; η2 = 0.196) and the TMT-B (P textless 0.001; η2 = 0.245) compared
  with the CG. In addition, the EG showed a lower HbO2 concentration in the prefrontal
  cortex than the CG during the SCWT (P textless 0.05; η2 = 0.076) and the TMT-B (P
  textless 0.05; η2 = 0.090).  Conclusions These findings shed new light on the clinical
  effectiveness of acute moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on executive function
  and prefrontal cortex activity in healthy older adults.
