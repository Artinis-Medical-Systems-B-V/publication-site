abstract: 'Prolonged sitting in a mild hypercapnic environment impairs peripheral
  vascular function. The effects of sitting interruptions using passive or active
  skeletal muscle contractions are still unclear. Therefore, we sought to examine
  the vascular effects of brief periods (2 min every half hour) of passive and active
  lower-limb movement to interrupt prolonged sitting with mild hypercapnia in adults.
  Fourteen healthy adults (24Â±2y) participated in 3 experimental visits sitting for
  2.5h in a mild hypercapnic environment (CO 2 =1500 ppm): control (CON, no limb movement),
  passive lower-limb movement (PASS), and active lower-limb movement (ACT) during
  sitting. At all visits, brachial and popliteal artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD),
  microvascular function, plasmatic levels of nitrate/nitrate and endothelin-1, and
  heart rate variability were assessed before and after sitting. Brachial and popliteal
  artery FMDs were reduced in CON and PASS (Ptextless0.05) but were preserved (Ptextgreater0.05)
  in ACT. Microvascular function was blunted in CON (Ptextless0.05) but was preserved
  in PASS and ACT (Ptextgreater0.05). Additionally, total plasma nitrate/nitrite was
  preserved in ACT (Ptextgreater0.05) but was reduced in CON and PASS (Ptextless0.05),
  and endothelin-1 levels were decreased in ACT (Ptextless0.05). Both passive and
  active movement induced a greater ratio between the low frequency and high frequency
  band for heart rate variability (Ptextless0.05). For the first time, we found that
  brief periods of passive leg movement can preserve microvascular function, but that
  an intervention that elicits larger increases in shear rate, such as low-intensity
  exercise, is required to fully protect both macrovascular and microvascular function
  and circulating vasoactive substance balance.'
