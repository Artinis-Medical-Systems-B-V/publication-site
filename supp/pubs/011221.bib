	abstract = {Purpose
The assessment of low-contrast-details is a part of the quality control (QC) program in digital radiology. It generally consists of evaluating the threshold contrast (Cth) detectability details for different-sized inserts, appropriately located in dedicated QC test tools. This work aims to propose a simplified method, based on a statistical model approach for threshold contrast estimation, suitable for different modalities in digital radiology.
Methods
A home-made low-contrast phantom, made of a central aluminium insert with a step-wedge, was assembled and tested. The reliability and robustness of the method were investigated for Mammography, Digital Radiography, Fluoroscopy and Angiography. Images were analysed using our dedicated software developed on Matlab®. The Cth is expressed in the same unit (mmAl) for all studied modalities.
Results
This method allows the collection of Cth information from different modalities and equipment by different vendors, and it could be used to define typical values. Results are summarized in detail. For 0.5 diameter detail, Cth results are in the range of: 0.018–0.023 mmAl for 2D mammography and 0.26–0.34 mmAl DR images. For angiographic images, for 2.5 mm diameter detail, the Cth s median values are 0.55, 0.4, 0.06, 0.12 mmAl for low dose fluoroscopy, coronary fluorography, cerebral and abdominal DSA, respectively.
Conclusions
The statistical method proposed in this study gives a simple approach for Low-Contrast-Details assessment, and the typical values proposed can be implemented in a QA program for digital radiology modalities.},

	title = {Acute effects of myofascial reorganization on trapezius muscle oxygenation in individuals with nonspecific neck pain},
	issn = {13608592},
	doi = {10.1016/j.jbmt.2021.10.010},
	abstract = {Background and purpose
Nonspecific neck pain (NNP) is a common idiopathic disorder in the general population that affects the trapezius muscle (TM) and blood supply, thereby compromising the fascial system. Myofascial reorganization (MR) is a physical therapy technique that can influence the dynamics of local fluids reducing excessive muscle tension and capillary constriction, and increasing local blood flow. This study aimed to investigate whether MR improves peripheral muscle oxygenation.

Methods
This was a quasi-experimental study with an intentional non-probability sample. Fifty participants (women: 36, men: 14) with and without NNP were assigned to either the experimental group (EG: n = 25, with NNP, subjected to MR) or the control group (CG: without NNP, no MR intervention). TM oxygenation was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) before and after a single intervention. In addition, functional disability (CG: 5.48 ± 5.58\%/EG: 21.12 ± 7.73\%) and neck pain were measured using the neck disability index. The pain pressure threshold (CG: 70.49 ± 32.29 kgf/EG: 51.08 ± 27.65 kgf) and pain intensity (CG: 0.76 ± 1.56/EG: 3.28 ± 2.35) were also measured. All participants were evaluated and reassessed after 10 min.

Results
The results revealed that immediately after 10 min of MR, the EG exhibited an increase in the oxyhemoglobin level of the medium fibers of the TM (0.72 ± 1.47 vs. −0.14 ± 1.33 mmol/dL, p = 0.01).

Conclusion
The findings indicate that application of MR for 10 min increases the tissue oxyhemoglobin level in the TM of the group with NNP compared to the CG without NNP.},

In this study, we have compared the performances of 13 units of a continuous wave near-infrared spectroscopy device (PortaMon, Artinis Medical Systems, NL) to test their suitability for being used in the HEMOCOVID-19 clinical trial in 10 medical centers around the world. Detailed phantom and in vivo tests were employed to measure the precision and reproducibility of measurements of local blood oxygen saturation and total hemoglobin concentration under different conditions: for different devices used, different operators, for probe repositioning over the same location, and over time (hours/days/months). We have detected systematic differences between devices when measuring phantoms (inter-device variability, {\textless}4\%), which were larger than the intra-device variability ({\textless}1\%). This intrinsic variability is in addition to the variability during in vivo measurements on the forearm muscle resulting from errors in probe positioning and intrinsic physiological noise ({\textless}9\%), which was also larger than the inter-device differences ({\textless}3\%) during the same test. Lastly, we have tested the reproducibility of the protocol of the HEMOCOVID-19 clinical trial; that is, forearm muscle oxygenation monitoring during vascular occlusion tests over days. Overall, our conclusion is that these devices can be used in multi-center trials but care must be taken to characterize, follow-up, and statistically account for inter-device variability.},

We compared claudication distance (CD) values reported by patients or assessed by validated protocols to elaborate a formula capable of estimating more reliable values. Three hundred fifty-nine patients with claudication were measured at the time of entry into a rehabilitation program. Walking performance was obtained by patients’ reports (self-reported claudication distance, SR-CD) and was directly assessed to determine the claudication and maximal walking distance by the 6-min test (6-CD and 6-MWD) and an incremental treadmill test (T-CD and T-MWD). The degree of muscle deoxygenation was objectively determined at the calf by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during the treadmill test. Among the 289 subjects analyzed, SR-CD exceeded both 6-CD and T-CD (+155 and +182 m, respectively). SR-CD was moderately correlated with T-CD (r = 0.30), 6-CD (r = 0.32), and 6-MWD (r = 0.29) but not with muscle deoxygenation per meter walked, unlike T-CD and 6-CD. A formula adjusted for the presence of diabetes reduced patient overestimation by 92\%. The patient’s reported claudication distance was generally overestimated compared to objective measures, and it was made more reliable through a corrective factor for easy use in a clinical setting.},

of blood’s oxygenated hemoglobin (oxyHb) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxyHb) 
molecules during brain activity. This method has made it possible to evaluate the he modynamic changes of the brain during neuronal activity in a completely non-aggres sive manner. 
Objective: The present study has been designed to investigate and evaluate the 
brain cortex activities during imagining of the execution of wrist motor tasks by 
comparing fMRI and fNIRS imaging methods.
Material and Methods: This novel observational Optical Imaging study aims 
to investigate the brain motor cortex activity during imagining of the right wrist mo tor tasks in vertical and horizontal directions. To perform the study, ten healthy young 
right-handed volunteers were asked to think about right-hand movements in different 
directions according to the designed movement patterns. The required data were col lected in two wavelengths, including 845 and 763 nanometers using a 48 channeled 
fNIRS machine. 
Results: Analysis of the obtained data showed the brain activity patterns during 
imagining of the execution of a movement are formed in various points of the motor 
cortex in terms of location. Moreover, depending on the direction of the movement, 
activity plans have distinguishable patterns. The results showed contralateral M1 was 
mainly activated during imagining of the motor cortex (p{\textless}0.05).
Conclusion: The results of our study showed that in brain imaging, it is possible 
to distinguish between patterns of activities during wrist motion in different directions 
using the recorded signals obtained through near-infrared Spectroscopy. The findings 
of this study can be useful in further studies related to movement control and BCI},

	abstract = {Background:
              At present, the effects of upper limb movement are generally evaluated from the level of motor performance. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the response of the cerebral cortex to different upper limb movement patterns from the perspective of neurophysiology.
            
            
              Method:
              Thirty healthy adults (12 females, 18 males, mean age 23.9 ± 0.9 years) took resistance and non-resistance exercises under four trajectories (T1: left and right straight-line movement; T2: front and back straight-line movement; T3: clockwise and anticlockwise drawing circle movement; and T4: clockwise and anticlockwise character ⁕ movement). Each movement included a set of periodic motions composed of a 30-s task and a 30-s rest. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to measure cerebral blood flow dynamics. Primary somatosensory cortex (S1), supplementary motor area (SMA), pre-motor area (PMA), primary motor cortex (M1), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) were chosen as regions of interests (ROIs). Activation maps and symmetric heat maps were applied to assess the response of the cerebral cortex to different motion patterns.
            
            
              Result:
              The activation of the brain cortex was significantly increased during resistance movement for each participant. Specifically, S1, SMA, PMA, and M1 had higher participation during both non-resistance movement and resistance movement. Compared to non-resistance movement, the resistance movement caused an obvious response in the cerebral cortex. The task state and the resting state were distinguished more obviously in the resistance movement. Four trajectories can be distinguished under non-resistance movement.
            
            
              Conclusion:
              This study confirmed that the response of the cerebral motor cortex to different motion patterns was different from that of the neurophysiological level. It may provide a reference for the evaluation of resistance training effects in the future.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.crphys.2021.11.001},
	abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of fatigue on muscular performance, oxygenation saturation, and cognition following acute hypoxic exposure at Normoxia, Moderate Hypoxia (MH), and Severe Hypoxia (SH).

Methods
Twelve males performed 3 sets of leg extensions to failure under Normoxia (FiO2: 21\%), MH (Fi02: 15.4\%), and SH (Fi02: 12.9\%). Heart rate, peripheral oxygenation saturation, total saturation index, psychomotor vigilance testing reaction time, psychomotor vigilance error rate, maximum strength, and repetitions to failure were measured throughout each visit.

Results
The primary findings indicated that MH and SH resulted in significant decreases in psychomotor vigilance test performance (MH: 388.25–427.17 ms, 0.41–0.33 error rate; SH: 398.17–445.42 ms reaction time, 0.25–1.00 error rate), absolute muscle tissue oxygen saturation (Abs-StO2) (MH:67.22\% compared to SH:57.56\%), but similar muscular strength, heart rate, and patterns of muscle tissue oxygen saturation responses (StO2\%) during fatigue when compared to Normoxia. There was an acute decrease in the ability to remain vigilant and/or respond correctly to visual stimuli as indicated by the worsened reaction time (PVTRT) during MH (FiO2: 15.4\%) and increased PVTRT and error rate (PVTE) during SH (FiO2: 12.9\%) conditions.

Conclusions
Acute hypoxic exposure in the current study was not a sufficient stimuli to elicit hypoxic-related changes in HR, muscular strength (1-RM), or repetitions to failure. The SpO2 responses were hypoxic-level dependent with increasing levels of hypoxia resulting in greater and more sustained reductions in SpO2. The combined SpO2 and StO2 responses at MH and SH suggested a balance between the muscles metabolic demand remaining lower than the muscle oxygen diffusion capacity. During the SH condition, Abs-StO2 suggested greater metabolic stress than Normoxia and MH conditions during the fatiguing leg extensions. The patterns of responses for StO2\% during the three sets of leg press to failure indicated that exercise is a more potent influencer to muscle oxygenation status than hypoxic conditions (FiO2: 15.4 and 12.9\%).},

Muscle activation (root mean square value calculated from surface electromyography) and oxygenation (integrated-tissue saturation index derived from near-infrared spectroscopy) were monitored for the biceps brachii muscle. The total number of repetitions before failure at 30\% 1RM (122 ± 5 vs. 131 ± 5; P=0.021), but not 70\% 1RM (39 ± 1 vs. 41 ± 2; P=0.313), was lower in hypoxia compared to normoxia. Root mean square activity of the biceps brachii muscle was higher for 70\% 1RM compared to 30\% 1RM (P{\textless}0.001), while the increase in muscle activation from the first to the last set (P{\textless}0.001) occurred independently of altitude (P{\textgreater}0.158).

              Background
              COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory disease; however, there is also evidence that it causes endothelial damage in the microvasculature of several organs. The aim of the present study is to characterize in vivo the microvascular reactivity in peripheral skeletal muscle of severe COVID-19 patients.
            
            
              Methods
              
                This is a prospective observational study carried out in Spain, Mexico and Brazil. Healthy subjects and severe COVID-19 patients admitted to the intermediate respiratory (IRCU) and intensive care units (ICU) due to hypoxemia were studied. Local tissue/blood oxygen saturation (StO
                2
                ) and local hemoglobin concentration (THC) were non-invasively measured on the forearm by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). A vascular occlusion test (VOT), a three-minute induced ischemia, was performed in order to obtain dynamic StO
                2
                parameters: deoxygenation rate (DeO
                2
                ), reoxygenation rate (ReO
                2
                ), and hyperemic response (H
                AUC
                ). In COVID-19 patients, the severity of ARDS was evaluated by the ratio between peripheral arterial oxygen saturation (SpO
                2
                ) and the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO
                2
                ) (SF ratio).
              
            
            
              Results
              
                Healthy controls (32) and COVID-19 patients (73) were studied. Baseline StO
                2
                and THC did not differ between the two groups. Dynamic VOT-derived parameters were significantly impaired in COVID-19 patients showing lower metabolic rate (DeO
                2
                ) and diminished endothelial reactivity. At enrollment, most COVID-19 patients were receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) (53\%) or high-flow nasal cannula support (32\%). Patients on MV were also receiving sedative agents (100\%) and vasopressors (29\%). Baseline StO
                2
                and DeO
                2
                negatively correlated with SF ratio, while ReO
                2
                showed a positive correlation with SF ratio. There were significant differences in baseline StO
                2
                and ReO
                2
                among the different ARDS groups according to SF ratio, but not among different respiratory support therapies.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              Patients with severe COVID-19 show systemic microcirculatory alterations suggestive of endothelial dysfunction, and these alterations are associated with the severity of ARDS. Further evaluation is needed to determine whether these observations have prognostic implications. These results represent interim findings of the ongoing HEMOCOVID-19 trial.

	abstract = {Background: The efficacy of interlimb-coordinated training on gait and upper limb functional improvement remains unclear. The latest published randomized controlled trials have supported the potential benefits of interlimb-coordinated training to enhance gait function. Upper limb functional recovery may also benefit from interlimb-coordinated training since most everyday activities require the coordinated use of both hands to complete a task. This study investigates the efficacy of interlimb-coordinated training on gait and upper limb functional recovery over a short-medium term period. Methods: A total of 226 acute stroke patients will be recruited from four centres over four years. Patients will be randomly allocated to either conventional therapy or conventional therapy plus interlimb-coordinated training. Outcomes will be recorded at baseline, after 2 weeks of intervention, and at 3- and 6-months post-intervention. Gait speed is the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures include Fugl–Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery, Berg Balance Scale, Timed Up and Go test, Action Research Arm Test, electroencephalography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Conclusion: The results of this trial will provide an in-depth understanding of the efficacy of early interlimb-coordinated intervention on gait and upper functional rehabilitation and how it may relate to the neural plasticity process.},

	abstract = {We aimed to investigate whether changes in prefrontal cortex (PFC) oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb) and deoxyhemoglobin (HHb) associates with inspiratory muscle effort during inspiratory threshold loading (ITL) in healthy participants.

Participants performed an incremental ITL. Breathing pattern, partial pressure of end-tidal CO2 (PETCO2), mouth pressure and O2Hb and HHb over the right dorsolateral PFC, sternocleidomastoid (SCM), and diaphragm/intercostals (Dia/IC) were monitored.

Fourteen healthy participants (8 men; 29 ± 5 years) completed testing. Dyspnea was higher post- than pre-ITL (5 ± 1 vs. 0 ± 1, respectively; P{\textless}0.05). PFC O2Hb increased (P {\textless} 0.001) and HHb decreased (P = 0.001) at low loads but remained stable with increasing ITL intensities. PFC total hemoglobin increased at task failure compared to rest. SCM HHb increased throughout increasing intensities. SCM and Dia/IC total hemoglobin increased in the at task failure compared to rest. PETCO2 did not change (P = 0.528).

PFC is activated early during the ITL but does not show central fatigue at task failure despite greater dyspnea and an imbalance of SCM oxygen demand and delivery.},

	abstract = {Interpersonal synchrony refers to alignment in time of interacting individuals. Recent neuroimaging findings indicate that the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) — a core region of the observation-execution system — is not only activated during tasks that involve synchrony, but also coupled between interaction partners, suggesting a key role for the IFG in mediating interpersonal synchrony. In this study we investigated whether inter-brain synchrony (IBS) is modulated by inter-group relationships. We examined this question in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict — one of the world's most prolonged and intractable conflicts. Using functional Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning, we measured IBS among ingroup vs. inter-group dyads (same-nationality dyads and Jewish-Palestinian dyads, respectively) while they performed a task entailing 2D movement synchrony. The results point to an increase in behavioral synchrony and greater enjoyment in the ingroup dyads, compared to the inter-group dyads. Critically, IBS in the left IFG significantly increased throughout task and it was higher among ingroup compared to inter-group dyads. Our findings highlight the effect of group membership on IBS plasticity.},

	abstract = {In high-intensity interval training the interval duration can be adjusted to optimize training results in oxygen uptake, cardiac output, and local oxygen supply. This study aimed to compare these variables in two interval trainings (long intervals HIIT3m: 3 min work, 3 min active rest vs. short intervals HIIT30s: 30 s work, 30 s active rest) at the same overall work rate and training duration. 24 participants accomplished both protocols, (work: 80\% power output at VO2peak, relief: 85\% power output at gas exchange threshold) in randomized order. Spirometry, impedance cardiography, and near-infrared spectroscopy were used to analyze the physiological stress of the cardiopulmonary system and muscle tissue. Although times above gas exchange threshold were shorter in HIIT3m (HIIT3m 1669.9 ± 310.9 s vs. HIIT30s 1769.5 ± 189.0 s, p = 0.034), both protocols evoked similar average fractional utilization of VO2peak (HIIT3m 65.23 ± 4.68\% VO2peak vs. HIIT30s 64.39 ± 6.78\% VO2peak, p = 0.261). However, HIIT3m resulted in higher cardiovascular responses during the loaded phases (VO2p {\textless} 0.001, cardiac output p {\textless} 0.001). Local hemodynamics were not different between both protocols. Average physiological responses were not different in both protocols owning to incomplete rests in HIIT30s and large response amplitudes in HIIT3m. Despite lower acute cardiovascular stress in HIIT30s, short submaximal intervals may also trigger microvascular and metabolic adaptions similar to HIIT3m. Therefore, the adaption of interval duration is an important tool to adjust the goals of interval training to the needs of the athlete or patient.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              : Dual-task studies have demonstrated that walking is attention-demanding for younger adults. However, numerous studies have attributed this to task type rather than the amount of required to accomplish the task. This study examined four tasks: two discrete (i.e., short intervals of attention) and two continuous (i.e., sustained attention) to determine whether greater attentional demands result in greater dual-task costs due to an overloaded processing capacity.
            
            
              Methods
              : Nineteen young adults (21.5 ± 3.6 years, 13 females) completed simple reaction time (SRT) and go/no-go (GNG) discrete cognitive tasks and n-back (NBK) and double number sequence (DNS) continuous cognitive tasks with or without self-paced walking. Prefrontal cerebral hemodynamics were measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and performance was measured using response time, accuracy, and gait speed.
            
            
              Results
              : Repeated measures ANOVAs revealed decreased accuracy with increasing cognitive demands (
              p
              = 0.001) and increased dual-task accuracy costs (
              p
              \&lt; 0.001). Response times were faster during the single compared to dual-tasks during the SRT (
              p
              = 0.005) and NBK (
              p
              = 0.004). DNS gait speed was also slower in the dual compared to single task (
              p
              \&lt; 0.001). Neural findings revealed marginally significant interactions between dual-task walking and walking alone in the DNS (
              p
              = 0.06) and dual -task walking compared to the NBK cognitive task alone (
              p
              = 0.05).
            
            
              Conclusion
              : Neural findings suggest a trend towards increased PFC activation during continuous tasks. Cognitive and motor measures revealed worse performance during the discrete compared to continuous tasks. Future studies should consider examining different attentional demands of motor tasks.},
