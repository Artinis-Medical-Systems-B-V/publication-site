abstract: 'The ankle-brachial index is an accurate tool for detecting claudication
  in atherosclerotic patients. However, this technique fails to identify subtle flow
  limitations of the iliac arteries (FLIA) in endurance athletes. Near-infrared spectroscopy
  (NIRS) is a noninvasive technique that measures skeletal muscle tissue oxygenation
  status. The aim of the present study is to examine the absolute and relative test–retest
  reliability of NIRS and evaluate its potential as a diagnostic tool in FLIA. NIRS-derived
  exercise variables were analyzed during exercise and recovery in FLIA 17 patients
  and 19 healthy controls. The relative reliability of absolute variables (such as
  the maximal value) were slight to yet predominantly substantial (intraclass correlation
  coefficient [ICC], ICC range: 0.06–0.76) with good to excellent absolute reliability
  (absolute limits of agreement [ALoA], ALoA range: 0.8 ± 10.2 to 0.7 ± 13.1; coefficient
  of variation [CV], CV range: 5%–11%). Absolute values encompassing signal amplitudes
  showed moderate to almost perfect relative reliability (ICC range: 0.51–0.89) and
  poor to good absolute reliability (ALoA range: −1.3 ± 7.0 to −2.5 ± 15.7; CV range:
  15%–32%). Kinetic variables showed moderate to almost perfect relative reliability
  for most recovery kinetics variables (ICC range: 0.54–0.86) with fair to good absolute
  reliability (ALoA range: 0.4 ± 12.2 to 3.9 ± 37.9; CV range: 18%–27%). Particularly,
  kinetic variables showed significant differences between patients and healthy subjects.
  NIRS is found to be a reliable method for examining muscle tissue oxygenation variables.
  Given the significant differences in especially recovery kinetics between normal
  subjects and patients, NIRS may contribute to diagnosing FLIA in endurance athletes.'
