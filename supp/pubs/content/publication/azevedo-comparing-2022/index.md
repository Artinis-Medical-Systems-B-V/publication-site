abstract: 'Muscle oxygen uptake (V̇O 2m ) evaluated from changes in the near-infrared
  spectroscopy oxygen desaturation slope during a 5-s arterial blood flow occlusion
  has been proposed as an estimation of the actual V̇O 2m . However, its correspondence
  with pulmonary oxygen uptake (V̇O 2p ) during exercise remains unknown. Purpose:
  to investigate the V̇O 2m and V̇O 2p relationship in females and males in response
  to prolonged constant-load cycling exercise at different intensities. Methods: Eighteen
  participants (8 females) visited the laboratory on six occasions: 1) ramp incremental
  test; 2-3) 30-min constant power output (constant-PO) exercise bout to determine
  the maximal lactate steady state (MLSS); 4-6) constant-PO exercise bouts to task
  failure at (i) 15% below MLSS (MLSS -15% ); (ii) MLSS; (iii) 15% above MLSS (MLSS
  +15% ). V̇O 2m was estimated at baseline, at min 5, 10, 20, 30, and at task failure.
  V̇O 2p was continuously recorded during the constant-PO bouts. Results: V̇O 2p  and
  V̇O 2m significantly increased from min 5 to min 30 in MLSS condition (all p textless
  0.05) and from min 5 to min 10 in MLSS +15% condition (all p textless 0.05). V̇O
  2p  and V̇O 2m were correlated (r 2 adj range of 0.70-0.98, all p textless 0.001)
  amongst exercise intensities in both females and males. Additionally, both variables
  were also correlated when expressed as percent (r 2 adj range of 0.52-0.77, all
  p textless 0.001). Conclusion: V̇O 2p and V̇O 2m responses were similar when exercising
  below, at, and above the MLSS independently of sex. Most importantly, V̇O 2p and  V̇O
  2m were correlated regardless the exercise intensity and sex of the participants.'
