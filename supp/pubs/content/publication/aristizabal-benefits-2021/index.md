abstract: 'Background: Physical training of lower leg skeletal muscle has been shown
  to increase exercise tolerance in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients.
  The objective of this study was to measure the effect of concurrent aerobic-resistance
  interval exercise on lower leg muscle function and local muscle tissue oxygenation
  in the vastus lateralis muscle (VLM) of COPD patients.  Methods: Peripheral muscle
  oxygenation in the VLM was measured using Near Infrared Spectrometry (NIRS) during
  the six- minute walk test (6MWT) in 15 COPD patients: Experimental (EXP., n = 9)
  and control (CTL., n = 6). Both groups trained for 3 weeks (1 hour/day and 5 days/week).
  Training sessions consisted of upper body strength exercises for 20 minutes. Next,
  the CTL. Group performed 30 minutes of aerobic exercise (motorized treadmill or
  stationary bike), while the EXP. group completed 30 minutes of aerobic-resistance
  (concurrent training) interval exercise (non-motorized treadmill). Pre and post-intervention
  NIRS measurements included oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb), deoxyhemoglobin (HHb), hemoglobin
  difference (HbDif), total hemoglobin (tHb), and tissue saturation index (TSI). Systemic
  arterial oxygen saturation (SPO2), heart rate and the rating of perceived exertion
  with the modified Borg scale were also measured pre and post-intervention during
  the 6MWT.  Results: All patients were able to complete three weeks of training.
  A significant increase in the 6MWT (51.4%, p textless 0.05) distance was noted in
  the EXP. group and in the VLM HbDiff (69%, p textless 0.05). No significant differences
  were observed in the other muscle oxygenation variables.  Conclusion: Concurrent
  aerobic-resistance interval exercise increases the total distance covered at the
  6MWT (increased functional capacity) and muscle oxygen extraction.'
