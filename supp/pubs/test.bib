	abstract = {Aims: The aims of this study were (1) to investigate the influence of physical movement on nearinfrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data, (2) to establish a video-NIRS system which simultaneously records NIRS data and the subject’s movement, and (3) to measure the oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) concentration change (Δoxy-Hb) during a word fluency (WF) task. Experiment 1: In 5 healthy volunteers, we measured the oxy-Hb and deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) concentrations during 11 kinds of facial, head, and extremity movements. The probes were set in the bilateral frontal regions. The deoxy-Hb concentration was increased in 85\% of the measurements. Experiment 2: Using a pillow on the backrest of the chair, we established the video-NIRS system with data acquisition and video capture software. One hundred and seventy-six elderly people performed the WF task. The deoxy-Hb concentration was decreased in 167 subjects (95\%). Experiment 3: Using the video-NIRS system, we measured the Δoxy-Hb, and compared it with the results of the WF task. Δoxy-Hb was significantly correlated with the number of words. Conclusion: Like the blood oxygen level-dependent imaging effect in functional MRI, the deoxy-Hb concentration will decrease if the data correctly reflect the change in neural activity. The video-NIRS system might be useful to collect NIRS data by recording the waveforms and the subject’s appearance simultaneously.},
