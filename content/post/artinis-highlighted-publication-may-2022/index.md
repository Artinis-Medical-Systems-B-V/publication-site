---
This month, we chose three highlighted publications with use of our NIRS and fNIRS devices.

* This paper investigates the effect of simultaneous cognitive and physical exercise on exhibitive function in health older subjects by using the OxyMon. [Acute Effect of a Simultaneous Exercise and Cognitive Task on Executive Functions and Prefrontal Cortex Oxygenation in Healthy Older Adults](https://publications.artinis.com/publication/pellegrini-laplagne-acute-2022/) Pellegrini-Laplagne M, Dupuy O, Sosner P, Bosquet L (2022).
* Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a widely spread condition that often includes skeletal muscle myopathy as symptom. This study assesses the underlying mechanisms in PAD patients using the PortaLite. [Impaired microcirculatory function, mitochondrial respiration, and oxygen ulitization in skeletal muscle of chaudicating patients with perihperal artery disease.](https://publications.artinis.com/publication/park-impaired-2022/) Park SY, Pekas EH, Anderson JP, Kambis TN, Mishra PK, Schieber MN, Wooden TK, Thompson JR, Kim KS, Pipinos II (2022).
* In this study, fNIRS was used to assess the advantage of bilingualism on executive function in pre-schoolers using the OxyMon. [Bilinguals have more effective executive function: Evidence from an fNIRS study of the neural correlates of cognitive shifting.](https://publications.artinis.com/publication/li-bilinguals-2022/) Li H, Wu D, Sha Xi JY, Chang C, Luo J (2022).
