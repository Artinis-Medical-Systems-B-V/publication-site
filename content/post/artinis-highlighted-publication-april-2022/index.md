title: 'Highlighted Publication April 2022'
---
This month, we chose three highlighted publications with use of our NIRS and fNIRS devices.

* Intermittent claudication is associated with decreased oxygenation and blood flow to lower-limb muscles and can result in pain and impaired functional capacity. In this study, the effect of a hybrid exercise intervention on muscle oxygenation and functional capacity was investigated with help of the PortaMon. [Near infrared spectroscopy to evaluate the effect of a hybrid exercise programme on peripheral muscle metabolism in patients with intermittent claudication: an exploratory PROSECO-IC sub study.](https://publications.artinis.com/publication/cornelis-near-2022/) Cornelis N., Chatzinikolaou P.N., Buys R., De Wilde C., Fourneau I., Claes J., Goetschalckx K., Cornelissen V. (2022).
* In this study hemodynamics in the prefrontal-cortex were assessed during executive function processing as response to high intensity intermittent exercise in male and female young adults using the Brite. [Prefrontal cortex hemodynamic response to acute high intensity intermittent exercise during executive function processing.](https://publications.artinis.com/publication/khandekar-prefrontal-2022/) Khandekar P., Shenoy S., Sathe A. (2022).
* Pilots need to process multiple different information simultaneously during flights. In this study ECG and fNIRS with use of the OctaMon were combined to assess changes in mental workload during multitasking in simulated flights. [Evaluating mental workload during multitasking in simulated flight.](https://publications.artinis.com/publication/li-evaluating-2022/) Li W., Xiw X., Chang Y. (2022).
