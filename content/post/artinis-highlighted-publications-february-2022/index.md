title: 'Highlighted Publication February 2022'
---
This month, we chose three highlighted publications with use of our NIRS and fNIRS devices.

* In this study, fNIRS was used for the first time cortical hemodynamic response to favorite music using a frequency domain approach was measured with application of the OxyMon. [Increase in Low-Frequency Oscillations in fNIRS as Cerebral Response to Auditory Stimulation with Familiar Music.](https://publications.artinis.com/publication/bicciato-increase-2021/) Bicciato G, Keller E, Wolf M, Brandi G, and Schulthess S, Friedl SG, Willms JF, Narula G (2022).
* Both aging and cardiovascular diseases are associated with reduced muscle oxygen saturation during exercise recovery. This study examined the influence of both factors on muscle re-oxygenation during exercise recovery by using the PortaMon. [The influence of cardiovascular risk factors on near-infrared spectroscopy-derived muscle oxygen saturation during exercise recovery in older adults.](https://publications.artinis.com/publication/de-oliveira-influence-2022/) De Oliveira GV, Volino-Souza M, Barros-Santos E, Conte-Junior CA, Alvares TS (2022).
* In this study, effects of repeated sprint training in hypoxia on muscle oxygenation, aerobic performance and repeated sprint ability in Rugby players were investigated with use of the PortaMon. [Repeated sprint training under hypoxia improves aerobic performance and repeated sprint ability by enhancing muscle deoxygenation and markers of angiogenesis in rugby sevens.](https://publications.artinis.com/publication/pramkratok-repeated-2022/) Pramkratok W, Songsupap T, Yimlamai T (2022).
