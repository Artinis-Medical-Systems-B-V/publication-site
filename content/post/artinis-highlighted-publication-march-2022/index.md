title: 'Highlighted Publication March 2022'
---
This month, we chose three highlighted publications with use of our NIRS and fNIRS devices.

* In this study, the OctaMon+ is used to compare prefrontal cortex activity during single and dual task performance in older and younger adults. [Decreased automaticity contributes to dual task decrements in older compared to younger adults.](https://publications.artinis.com/publication/hassan-decreased-2022/) Hassan S.A., Bonetti L.V., Kasawara K.T., Beal D.S., Rozenberg D., Reid W.D. (2022).
* NIRS can be used to measure orthostatic cerebral oxygenation changes, but the influence of various determinants, such as age and sex, is still unknown. In this paper, the role determinants and their influence was assessed to improve interpretation of NIRS based measures with help of the PortaLite. [Determinants of orthostatic cerebral oxygenation assessed using near-infrared spectroscopy](https://publications.artinis.com/publication/mol-determinants-2022/) Mol A., Claassen J.A.H.R, van Wezel R.J.A., Meskers C.G.M. (2022).
* Prolonged sitting in a mild hypercapnic environment can lead to impairment in peripheral vascular functions. In this study the PortaLite is used to assess the effect of sitting interruptions when skeletal muscle contractions to protect vascular functions. [Benefits of Concurrent Aerobic-Resistance Interval Exercise in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease](https://publications.artinis.com/publication/aristizabal-benefits-2021/) Aristiz√°bal C., Ortiz O., Walsh E.J., Leone M., Comtois A.S. (2022).
