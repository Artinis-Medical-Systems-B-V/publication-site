fNIRS stands for functional near infrared spectroscopy. The functional component comes from the fact that our fNIRS devices are capable of assessing brain activity. This is done by measuring changes in oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin, which reflect local brain activity. Moreover, fNIRS provides a non-invasive manner to achieve an excellent resolution brain signal in real-time.
