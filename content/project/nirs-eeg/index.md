There are multiple brain imaging modalities available nowadays. But how do you decide which modality fits your research best? fNIRS is known for the fact that it is non-invasive, portable, and has a good spatial resolution. EEG on the other hand is known for its non-invasiveness and superior temporal resolution. By combining these two brain imaging modalities, you can measure brain activity in a non-invasive manner with excellent temporal and spatial resolution.
