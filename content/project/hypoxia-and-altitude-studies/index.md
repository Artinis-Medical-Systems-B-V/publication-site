A constant supply of oxygen to our muscles and organs is essential for the maintenance of proper body functioning. However, we frequently encounter conditions where the oxygen demand by tissue exceeds the supply, thereby leading to a state of oxygen deprivation, also called hypoxia. Because of our constant need for oxygen, our body has developed multiple mechanisms that detect oxygen levels, which in turn can activate appropriate responses to counter hypoxia and generate a higher oxygen supply. Moreover, understanding the physiological mechanism underlying the bodily response to oxygen deprivation is of major importance and our NIRS devices have shown to be a great tool in this field of research.
