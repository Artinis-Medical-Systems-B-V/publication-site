As fNIRS measures brain activity based on light, no interference occurs when combined with neurostimulation methods that use magnetic (TMS) or direct current stimulation (tDCS). Moreover, this makes fNIRS an ideal brain imaging modality in research where the brain has to be stimulated and local activity simultaneously quantified.
