The complex architecture of the human brain develops in an ongoing process that starts in the womb and continues into adulthood. In the first few years of human life, more than 1 million new neural connections are formed every second. The processes that underly the developing brain have long been a neuroscientific area of interest. The fNIRS devices developed by Artinis are lightweight, user-friendly, and comfortable, making them perfectly suited for studies on sensitive subjects, such as children.
