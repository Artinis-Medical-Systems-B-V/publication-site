abstract: "Listening to music engages the whole brain, thus stimulating cognitive\
  \ performance in a range of non-purely musical activities such as language and memory\
  \ tasks. This article addresses an ongoing debate on the link between music and\
  \ memory for words. While evidence on healthy and clinical populations suggests\
  \ that music listening can improve verbal memory in a variety of situations, it\
  \ is still unclear what specific memory process is affected and how. This study\
  \ was designed to explore the hypothesis that music specifically benefits the encoding\
  \ part of verbal memory tasks, by providing a richer context for encoding and therefore\
  \ less demand on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Twenty-two healthy\
  \ young adults were subjected to functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) imaging\
  \ of their bilateral DLPFC while encoding words in the presence of either a music\
  \ or a silent background. Behavioral data confirmed the facilitating effect of music\
  \ background during encoding on subsequent item recognition. fNIRS results revealed\
  \ significantly greater activation of the left hemisphere during encoding (in line\
  \ with the HERA model of memory lateralization) and a sustained, bilateral decrease\
  \ of activity in the DLPFC in the music condition compared to silence. These findings\
  \ suggest that music modulates the role played by the DLPFC during verbal encoding,\
  \ and open perspectives for applications to clinical populations with prefrontal\
  \ impairments, such as elderly adults or Alzheimer's patients. \xA9 2013 Ferreri,\
