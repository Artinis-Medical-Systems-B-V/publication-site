abstract: "In Alzheimer's disease (AD) cerebrovascular function is at risk. Transcranial\
  \ Doppler, near-infrared spectroscopy, and photoplethysmography are noninvasive\
  \ methods to continuously measure changes in cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV),\
  \ cerebral cortical oxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb), and blood pressure (BP). In 21\
  \ patients with mild to moderate AD and 20 age-matched controls, we investigated\
  \ how oscillations in cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) and O2Hb are associated\
  \ with spontaneous and induced oscillations in blood pressure (BP) at the very low\
  \ (VLF = 0.05 Hz) and low frequencies (LF = 0.1 Hz). We applied spectral and transfer\
  \ function analysis to quantify dynamic cerebral autoregulation and brain tissue\
  \ oxygenation. In AD, cerebrovascular resistance was substantially higher (34%,\
  \ AD vs. control: $\u03B4$ = 0.69 (0.25) mm Hg/cm/second, p = 0.012) and the transmission\
  \ of very low frequency (VLF) cerebral blood flow (CBF) oscillations into O2Hb differed,\
  \ with increased phase lag and gain ($\u03B4$ phase 0.32 [0.15] rad; $\u03B4$ gain\
  \ 0.049 [0.014] $\u03BC$mol/cm/second, p both < 0.05). The altered transfer of CBF\
  \ to cortical oxygenation in AD indicates that properties of the cerebral microvasculature\
  \ are changed in this disease. \xA9 2012 Elsevier Inc."
