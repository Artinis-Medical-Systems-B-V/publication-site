abstract: As societal interactions increasingly involve both intentional and unintentional
  agents, understanding their effects on human cognition becomes paramount. This study
  investigates the neural correlates of interacting with intentional versus artificial
  agents in a simulated tennis game scenario. Employing functional near-infrared spectroscopy
  (fNIRS), brain activity in 50 male participants during gameplay against both types
  of opponents was analyzed. The used methodological approach ensures ecological validity
  by simulating real-world decision-making scenarios while participants undergo fNIRS
  scanning, avoiding the constraints of traditional neuroimaging methods. Six prefrontal
  cortex channels are focused on, leveraging the 10-20 system, to capture nuanced
  differences in brain activity. Wavelet analysis was utilized to dissect the data
  into frequency-specific differences, revealing subtle variations across different
  channels and frequency bands. Moreover, activity was quantified by comparing average
  data signals between rest and play modes across all points using Generalized Linear
  Model (GLM). The findings unveil significant differences in neural activation patterns,
  particularly in one specific channel and frequency range, suggesting distinct cognitive
  processing when interacting with intentional agents. These results align with previous
  neuroimaging studies and contribute to understanding the neural underpinnings of
  human-agent interactions in naturalistic settings. While acknowledging study limitations,
  including sample homogeneity and spatial accuracy constraints, the study's findings
  underscore the potential of fNIRS in exploring complex cognitive phenomena beyond
  laboratory confines.
