abstract: "Background: Walking abnormalities in people with Parkinson's disease (PD)\
  \ are characterized by a shift in locomotor control from healthy automaticity to\
  \ compensatory prefrontal executive control. Indirect measures of automaticity of\
  \ walking (eg, step-to-step variability and dual-task cost) suggest that freezing\
  \ of gait (FoG) may be associated with reduced automaticity of walking. However,\
  \ the influence of FoG status on actual prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity during\
  \ walking remains unclear. Objective: To investigate the influence of FoG status\
  \ on automaticity of walking in people with PD. Methods: Forty-seven people with\
  \ PD were distributed into 2 groups based on FoG status, which was assessed by the\
  \ New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire: PD\u2212FoG (n = 23; UPDRS-III = 35) and PD+FoG\
  \ (n = 24; UPDRS-III = 43.1). Participants walked over a 9-m straight path (with\
  \ a 180\xB0 turn at each end) for 80 seconds. Two conditions were tested off medication:\
  \ single- and dual-task walking (ie, with a concomitant cognitive task). A portable\
  \ functional near-infrared spectroscopy system recorded PFC activity while walking\
  \ (including turns). Wearable inertial sensors were used to calculate spatiotemporal\
  \ gait parameters. Results: PD+FoG had greater PFC activation during both single\
  \ and dual-task walking than PD\u2212FoG (P =.031). There were no differences in\
  \ gait between PD\u2212FoG and PD+FoG. Both groups decreased gait speed (P =.029)\
  \ and stride length (P <.001) during dual-task walking compared with single-task\
  \ walking. Conclusions: These findings suggest that PD+FoG have reduced automaticity\
  \ of walking, even in absence of FoG episodes. PFC activity while walking seems\
  \ to be more sensitive than gait measures in identifying reduction in automaticity\
  \ of walking in PD+FoG."
