abstract: "Purpose: Although ischaemic preconditioning (IPC), induced by cycles of\
  \ transient limb ischaemia and reperfusion, seems to improve exercise performance,\
  \ the optimal duration of ischaemia\u2013reperfusion cycles is not established.\
  \ The present study investigated the effect of ischaemia\u2013reperfusion duration\
  \ within each IPC cycle on performance in a 2000-m rowing ergometer test. Methods:\
  \ After incremental and familiarization tests, 16 trained rowers (mean \xB1 SD:\
  \ age, 24 \xB1 11 years; weight, 74.1 \xB1 5.9\_kg; V\u02D9 O 2 peak, 67.2 \xB1\
  \ 7.4 mL\u02D9kg\u22121\u02D9min\u22121) were randomly submitted to a 2000-m rowing\
  \ test preceded by intermittent bilateral cuff inflation of the lower limbs with\
  \ three cycles of ischaemia\u2013reperfusion, lasting 5\_min (IPC-5) or 10\_min\
  \ (IPC-10) at 220 or 20\_mmHg (control). Power output, V\u02D9 O 2, heart rate,\
  \ blood lactate concentration, pH, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), and near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy-derived measurements of the vastus lateralis muscle were continuously\
  \ recorded. Results: No differences among treatments were found in the 2000-m test\
  \ (control: 424 \xB1 17; IPC-5: 425 \xB1 16; IPC-10: 424 \xB1 17\_s; P = 0.772).\
  \ IPC-10 reduced the tissue saturation index and oxy-haemoglobin concentration during\
  \ exercise compared with control. The power output during the last 100-m segment\
  \ was significantly lower with IPC-10. The IPC treatments increased the heart rate\
  \ over the first 500\_m and decreased the pH after exercise. No alterations were\
  \ observed in V\u02D9 O 2, blood lactate, or RPE among the trials. Conclusion: In\
  \ conclusion, IPC does not improve the 2000-m rowing ergometer performance of trained\
  \ athletes regardless of the length of ischaemia\u2013reperfusion cycles."
