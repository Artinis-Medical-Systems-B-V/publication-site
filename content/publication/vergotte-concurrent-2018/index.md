abstract: In behavioral neuroscience, the adaptability of humans facing different
  constraints has been addressed on one side at the brain level, where a variety of
  functional networks dynamically support the same performance, and on the other side
  at the behavioral level, where fractal properties in sensorimotor variables have
  been considered as a hallmark of adaptability. To bridge the gap between the two
  levels of observation, we have jointly investigated the changes of network connectivity
  in the sensorimotor cortex assessed by modularity analysis and the properties of
  motor variability assessed by multifractal analysis during a prolonged tapping task.
  Four groups of participants had to produce the same tapping performance while being
  deprived from 0, 1, 2, or 3 sensory feedbacks simultaneously (auditory and/or visual
  and/or tactile). Whereas tapping performance was not statistically different across
  groups, the number of brain networks involved and the degree of multifractality
  of the inter-tap interval series were significantly correlated, increasing as a
  function of feedback deprivation. Our findings provide first evidence that concomitant
  changes in brain modularity and multifractal properties characterize adaptations
  underlying unchanged performance. We discuss implications of our findings with respect
  to the degeneracy properties of complex systems, and the entanglement of adaptability
  and effective adaptation.
