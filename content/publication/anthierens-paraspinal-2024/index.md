abstract: This study aimed to compare the systemic and local metabolic responses during
  a 5-min trunk extension exercise in individuals with chronic low back pain (CLBP)
  and in healthy individuals. Thirteen active participants with CLBP paired with 13
  healthy participants performed a standardised 5-min trunk extension exercise on
  an isokinetic dynamometer set in continuous passive motion mode. During exercise,
  we used near-infrared spectroscopy to measure tissue oxygenation (TOI) and total
  haemoglobin-myoglobin (THb). We used a gas exchange analyser to measure breath-by-breath
  oxygen consumption (V̇O2) and carbon dioxide produced (V̇CO2). We also calculated
  mechanical efficiency. We assessed the intensity of low back pain sensation before
  and after exercise by using a visual analogue scale. In participants with CLBP,
  low back pain increased following exercise (+ 1.5 units; p textless 0.001) and THb
  decreased during exercise (− 4.0 units; p = 0.043). Paraspinal muscle oxygenation
  (65.0 and 71.0%, respectively; p = 0.009) and mechanical efficiency (4.7 and 5.3%,
  respectively; p = 0.034) were both lower in participants with CLBP compared with
  healthy participants. The increase in pain sensation was related to the decrease
  in tissue oxygenation (R2 = − 0.420; p = 0.036). Decreases in total haemoglobin-myoglobin
  and mechanical efficiency could involve fatigability in exercise-soliciting paraspinal
  muscles and, therefore, exacerbate inabilities in daily life. Given the positive
  correlation between tissue oxygenation and exercise-induced pain exacerbation, muscle
  oxygenation may be related to persisting and crippling low back pain.
