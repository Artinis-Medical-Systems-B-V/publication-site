abstract: "Background. Since the brain is intact, persons with a spinal cord injury\
  \ (SCI) might benefit from a brain-computer interface (BCI) to improve mobility\
  \ by making use of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Objective. We\
  \ aimed to use fNIRS to detect contralateral primary motor cortex activity during\
  \ attempted foot movements in participants with complete SCI. Methods. A 6-channel\
  \ fNIRS, including 2 reference channels, measured relative concentration changes\
  \ of oxy- (HbO) and deoxy-hemoglobin (HbR) in the contralateral motor cortex for\
  \ the right foot. Seven subjects, studied within 18 months after injury, performed\
  \ 12 trials of attempted right foot and real hand movements. Results. T tests revealed\
  \ significant HbO and HbR responses of the left motor cortex for attempted foot\
  \ movements, but not for right hand movements. A 2-way repeated-measures analysis\
  \ of variance revealed a larger decrease in HbR for attempted foot movements compared\
  \ to hand movements. Individual results show major interindividual differences in\
  \ (number of) channels activated and the sensitive chromophore (HbR or HbO). Conclusions.\
  \ On group level, activity in the motor cortex of the foot can be measured with\
  \ fNIRS in patients with complete SCI during attempted foot movements and might\
  \ in principle be used in future BCI studies and applications. \xA9 The Author(s)\
