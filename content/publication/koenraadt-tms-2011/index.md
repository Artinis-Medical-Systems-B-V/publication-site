abstract: "Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive optical imaging technique,\
  \ which is increasingly used to measure hemodynamic responses in the motor cortex.\
  \ The location at which the NIRS optodes are placed on the skull is a major factor\
  \ in measuring the hemodynamic responses optimally. In this study, the validity\
  \ of using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in combination with a 3D motion\
  \ analysis system to relocate the TMS derived position was tested. In addition,\
  \ the main goal was to quantify the advantage of using TMS to locate the optimal\
  \ position in relation to the most commonly used EEG C3 position. Markers were placed\
  \ on the TMS coil and on the head of the subject. In eleven subjects, a TMS measurement\
  \ was performed to determine the individual motor-evoked potential center-of-gravity\
  \ (MEP-CoG). This procedure was repeated in nine subjects to test the validity.\
  \ Subsequently, hemodynamic responses were measured at the MEP-CoG position and\
  \ at the C3 position during a thumb abduction and adduction task. On average, the\
  \ MEP-CoG location was located 19.2. mm away from the C3 position. The reproducibility\
  \ study on the MEP-CoG relocation procedure revealed no systematic relocations.\
  \ No differences in early and delayed hemodynamic responses were found between the\
  \ C3 and MEP-CoG position. These results indicate that using TMS for NIRS optodes\
  \ positioning on the motor cortex does not result in higher hemodynamic response\
  \ amplitudes. This could be explained if NIRS and TMS assess slightly different\
  \ functions. \xA9 2011 Elsevier B.V."
