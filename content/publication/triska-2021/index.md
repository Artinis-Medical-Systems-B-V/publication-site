abstract: "PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess and compare the systemic response of\
  \ oxygen uptake kinetics and muscle deoxygenation between a 30-min rest protocol\
  \ and a multivisit protocol on the parameters of the power-duration relationship\
  \ (i.e., critical power [CP] and W'). METHODS: Nine endurance-trained triathletes\
  \ reported to the laboratory on five occasions: a preliminary graded exercise test\
  \ and a familiarization, a 30-min single-visit protocol (time trials of 10, 5, and\
  \ 2 min in that order interspersed with 30 min rest), and a multivisit protocol\
  \ (time trials of 10, 5, and 2 min in randomized order interspersed by >24 h rest).\
  \ Heart rate (HR) was recorded continuously, respiratory gases were measured breath\
  \ by breath, and deoxygenation was recorded at 10 Hz using near-infrared spectroscopy\
  \ (NIRS) during all tests. Blood lactate (BLa-) concentration was measured before\
  \ all time trials. Maximal HR (HRmax), oxygen uptake (V\u02D9O2) during the first\
  \ 2 min (V\u02D9O2onset), mean response time, end-exercise V\u02D9O2 (V\u02D9O2peak),\
  \ V\u02D9O2 amplitude (amplV\u02D9O2), O2 deficit, NIRS $\u03C4$, amplitude (amplNIRS),\
  \ and time delay were assessed. To compare the two protocols and to assess the differences\
  \ in W' and CP, a paired sample t-test was used as well as a two-way ANOVA to assess\
  \ the differences between trials and/or protocols, including trial-protocol interactions.\
  \ RESULTS: No significant differences, and trivial effect sizes, were found for\
  \ W' and CP between protocols (P = 0.106-0.114, d < 0.01-0.08). Furthermore, no\
  \ significant differences between protocols were found for all parameters, except\
  \ for [BLa-]. Significant differences between trials were found for V\u02D9O2ampl,\
  \ V\u02D9O2onset, NIRS $\u03C4$, amplNIRS, [BLa-], and HRmax. CONCLUSION: Results\
  \ suggest that W' and CP can be determined using the 30-min rest protocol without\
  \ confounding effects of previous severe exercise compared with the multivisit protocol."
