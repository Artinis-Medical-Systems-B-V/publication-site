abstract: "Patients with left ventricular dysfunction may have different orthostatic\
  \ responses of blood pressure (BP) and cerebral oxygenation than healthy elderly\
  \ subjects. We investigated orthostatic changes in systemic haemodynamic variables\
  \ and cerebral oxygenation in 21 elderly patients with heart failure New York Heart\
  \ Association class I-III in stable condition (age 70-83 years) after withdrawal\
  \ of furosemide and captopril for 2 weeks, and in 18 healthy elderly subjects (age\
  \ 70-84 years). Frontal cortical concentration changes of oxyhaemoglobin ([O2Hb])\
  \ and deoxyhaemoglobin ([HHb]) were continuously measured by near-infrared spectrophotometry\
  \ and BP changes by Finapres before and during 10 min of standing. Upon standing\
  \ [O2Hb] reflecting blood flow, changed by -1.2 \xB1 0.9 $\u03BC$mol L-1 (mean \xB1\
  \ SEM) in the patients, whereas it decreased by -4.5 \xB1 0.6 $\u03BC$mol L-1 (P<0.01)\
  \ in the healthy subjects after standing (P<0.05 between groups). [HHb] reflecting\
  \ the sum of cerebral blood flow, arterial oxygen saturation and cerebral oxygen\
  \ uptake, increased by 1.5 \xB1 0.5 $\u03BC$mol L-1 (P<0.05) and 1.7 \xB1 0.6 $\u03BC\
  $mol L-1 (P<0.05), respectively. Compared with healthy elderly subjects, elderly\
  \ patients with left ventricular dysfunction showed smaller orthostatic [O2Hb] decreases\
  \ (P<0.01), in relation to higher orthostatic BP rises (P<0.05). These findings\
  \ indicate that BP changes and an altered cardiovascular balance may influence orthostatic\
  \ cortical haemodynamic responses in elderly subjects."
