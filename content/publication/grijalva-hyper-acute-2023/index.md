abstract: 'Introduction: Sub-concussive head impacts in soccer are drawing increasing
  research attention regarding their acute and long-term effects as players may experience
  thousands of headers in a single season. During these impacts, the head experiences
  rapid acceleration similar to what occurs during a concussion, but without the clinical
  implications. The physical mechanism and response to repetitive impacts are not
  completely understood. The objective of this work was to examine the immediate functional
  outcomes of sub-concussive level impacts from soccer heading in a natural, non-laboratory
  environment. Methods: Twenty university level soccer athletes were instrumented
  with sensor-mounted bite bars to record impacts from 10 consecutive soccer headers.
  Pre- and post-header measurements were collected to determine hyper-acute changes,
  i.e., within minutes after exposure. This included measuring blood flow velocity
  using transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound, oxyhemoglobin concentration using functional
  near infrared spectroscopy imaging (fNIRS), and upper extremity dual-task (UEF)
  neurocognitive testing. Results: On average, the athletes experienced 30.7 ± 8.9
  g peak linear acceleration and 7.2 ± 3.1 rad/s peak angular velocity, respectively.
  Results from fNIRS measurements showed an increase in the brain oxygenation for
  the left prefrontal cortex (PC) (p = 0.002), and the left motor cortex (MC) (p =
  0.007) following the soccer headers. Additional analysis of the fNIRS time series
  demonstrates increased sample entropy of the signal after the headers in the right
  PC (p = 0.02), right MC (p = 0.004), and left MC (p = 0.04) Discussion: These combined
  results reveal some variations in brain oxygenation immediately detected after repetitive
  headers. Significant changes in balance and neurocognitive function were not observed
  in this study, indicating a mild level of head impacts. This is the first study
  to observe hemodynamic changes immediately after sub-concussive impacts using non-invasive
  portable imaging technology. In combination with head kinematic measurements, this
  information can give new insights and a framework for immediate monitoring of sub-concussive
  impacts on the head.'
