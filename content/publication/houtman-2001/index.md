abstract: Spinal cord-injured (SCI) individuals, having a sympathetic nervous system
  lesion, experience hypotension during sitting and standing. Surprisingly, they experience
  few syncopal events. This suggests adaptations in cerebrovascular regulation. Therefore,
  changes in systemic circulation, cerebral blood flow, and oxygenation in eight SCI
  individuals were compared with eight able-bodied (AB) individuals. Systemic circulation
  was manipulated by lower body negative pressure at several levels down to -60 mmHg.
  At each level, we measured steady-state blood pressure, changes in cerebral blood
  velocity with transcranial Doppler, and cerebral oxygenation using near-infrared
  spectroscopy. We found that mean arterial pressure decreased significantly in SCI
  but not in AB individuals, in accordance with the sympathetic impairment in the
  SCI group. Cerebral blood flow velocity decreased during orthostatic stress in both
  groups, but this decrease was significantly greater in SCI individuals. Cerebral
  oxygenation decreased in both groups, with a tendency to a greater decrease in SCI
  individuals. Thus present data do not support an advantageous mechanism during orthostatic
  stress in the cerebrovascular regulation of SCI individuals.
