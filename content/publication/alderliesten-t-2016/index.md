abstract: 'Background and aim: Disturbances in cerebral oxygenation saturation (SO2)
  have been linked to adverse outcome in adults, children, and neonates. In intensive
  care, the cerebral SO2 is increasingly being monitored by Near-InfraRed Spectroscopy
  (NIRS). Unfortunately NIRS has a limited penetration depth. The "modified T2-prepared
  Blood Imaging of Oxygen Saturation" (T2-BIOS) MR sequence provides a step towards
  full brain SO2 measurement. Materials and methods: Tissue SO2, and venous SO2 (SvO2)
  were obtained simultaneously by T2-BIOS during a respiratory challenge in ten healthy
  volunteers. These two measures were compared to SO2 that was obtained by a single
  probe MR-compatible NIRS setup, and to cerebral blood flow and venous SO2 that were
  obtained by arterial spin labelling and T2-TRIR, respectively. Results: SO2-T2-BIOS
  and SO2-NIRS had a mean bias of -4.0% (95% CI -21.3% to 13.3%). SvO2-T2-BIOS correlated
  with SO2-NIRS (R2 = 0.41, p = 0.002) and SvO2-T2-TRIR (R2 = 0.87, p = 0.002). In
  addition, SO2-NIRS correlated with SvO2-T2-TRIR (R2 = 0.85, p = 0.003) Frontal cerebral
  blood flow correlated with SO2-T2-BIOS (R2 = 0.21, p = 0.04), but was not significant
  in relation to SO2-NIRS. Discussion/conclusion: Full brain SO2 assessment by any
  technique may help validating NIRS and may prove useful in guiding the clinical
  management of patient populations with cerebral injury following hypoxic-ischaemic
  events. The agreement between NIRS and T2-BIOS provides confidence in measuring
  cerebral SO2 by either technique. As it stands now, the T2-BIOS represents a novel
  idea and future work will focus on improvements to make it a reliable tool for SO2
  assessment.'
