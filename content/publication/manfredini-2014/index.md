abstract: "Background: Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) improves haemodynamics\
  \ in peripheral arterial disease (PAD), but its effects on foot perfusion were scarcely\
  \ studied. In severe PAD patients we measured the foot oxygenation changes evoked\
  \ by a novel intermittent IPC device (GP), haemodynamics and compliance to the treatment.\
  \ Reference values were obtained by a sequential foot-calf device (SFC).Methods:\
  \ Twenty ischemic limbs (Ankle-Brachial Index = 0.5 \xB1 0.2) of 12 PAD patients\
  \ (7 male, age: 74.5 \xB1 10.8 y) with an interval of 48 \xB1 2 hours received a\
  \ 35 minute treatment in supine position with two IPC devices: i) a Gradient Pump\
  \ (GP), which slowly inflates a single thigh special sleeve and ii) an SFC (ArtAssist\xAE\
  , ACI Medical, San Marcos, CA, USA), which rapidly inflates two foot-calf sleeves.\
  \ Main outcome measure: changes of oxygenated haemoglobin at foot (HbO2foot) by\
  \ continuous near-infrared spectroscopy recording and quantified as area-under-curve\
  \ (AUC) for periods of 5 minutes. Other measures: haemodynamics by echo-colour Doppler\
  \ (time average velocity (TAV) and blood flow (BF) in the popliteal artery and in\
  \ the femoral vein), patient compliance by a properly developed form.Results: All\
  \ patients completed the treatment with GP, 9 with SFC. HbO2foot during the working\
  \ phase, considered as average value of the 5 minutes periods, increased with GP\
  \ (AUC 458 \xB1 600 to 1216 \xB1 280) and decreased with SFC (AUC 231 \xB1 946 to\
  \ -1088 \xB1 346), significantly for most periods (P < 0.05). The GP treatment was\
  \ associated to significant haemodynamic changes from baseline to end of the treatment\
  \ (TAV = 10.2 \xB1 3.3 to 13.5 \xB1 5.5 cm/sec, P = 0.004; BF = 452.0 \xB1 187.2\
  \ to 607.9 \xB1 237.8 ml/sec, P = 0.0001), not observed with SFC (TAV = 11.2 \xB1\
  \ 3.4 to 11.8 \xB1 4.3 cm/sec; BF = 513.8 \xB1 203.7 to 505.9 \xB1 166.5 ml/min,\
  \ P = n.s.). GP obtained a higher score of patient compliance (P < 0.0001).Conclusions:\
  \ A novel IPC thigh device, unlike a traditional SFC device, increased foot oxygenation\
  \ in severe PAD, together with favourable haemodynamic response and high compliance\
  \ to the treatment under the present experimental conditions. \xA9 2014 Manfredini\
