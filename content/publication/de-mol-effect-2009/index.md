abstract: "To determine the effects of bladderbox alarms during venoarterial extracorporeal\
  \ membrane oxygenation (va-ECMO) on cerebral oxygenation and hemodynamics, six lambs\
  \ were prospectively treated with va-ECMO and bladderbox alarms were simulated.\
  \ Changes in concentrations of oxyhemoglobin ($\u0394$cO2Hb), deoxyhemoglobin ($\u0394\
  $cHHb), and total Hb ($\u0394$ctHb) were measured using near infrared spectrophotometry.\
  \ Fluctuations in Hb oxygenation index ($\u0394$HbD) and cerebral blood volume ($\u0394\
  $CBV) were calculated. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), blood flow\
  \ in the left carotid artery (Qcar), and central venous pressure (CVP) were registered.\
  \ Bladderbox alarms were simulated by increasing the ECMO flow or partially clamping\
  \ the venous cannula and resolved by decreasing the ECMO flow, unclamping the cannula,\
  \ or intravascular volume administration. CBV, HbD, MAP, and Qcar decreased significantly\
  \ during bladderbox alarms, whereas HR and CVP increased. After the bladderbox alarms,\
  \ CBV and HbD increased significantly to values above baseline. For HbD, this increase\
  \ was higher during intravascular volume administration. MAP, Qcar, and CVP recovered\
  \ to preexperiment values but increased further with volume administration. HR was\
  \ increased at the end of our measurements. We conclude that Bladderbox alarms during\
  \ va-ECMO treatment result in significant fluctuations in cerebral oxygenation and\
  \ hemodynamics, a possible risk factor for intracranial lesions. \xA9 2009 International\
