abstract: 'Objective: Previous studies suggest that the combination of robot-assisted
  training with other concurrent tasks may promote the functional recovery and improvement
  better than the single task. It is well-established that robot-assisted rehabilitation
  training is effective. This study aims to characterize the neural mechanisms and
  inter-regional connectivity changes associated with robot-assisted parallel interactive
  training tasks. Methods: Twenty-five healthy young adults (12 females and 13 males)
  participated in three number-related cognitive-motor parallel interactive training
  tasks categorized by difficulty: low difficulty (LD), medium difficulty (MD), and
  high difficulty (HD). Functional near-infrared spectroscopy was used to measure
  neural responses in the primary sensorimotor cortex (SM1), supplementary motor area
  (SMA), and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Activation maps and functional connectivity
  (FC) correlation matrix maps were applied to assess cortical response and connectivity
  among channels and regions of interest. Results: Significant differences were observed
  in both activation and connectivity results across the three training conditions.
  Stronger activation (p textless 0.01) in oxy-hemoglobin was found in the MD conditions,
  with activation in the HD condition being stronger than in the LD condition. The
  FC in the PFC increased linearly with rising training difficulty. Trends in FC for
  SM1 and SMA were consistent with the activation results. Conclusions: In parallel
  training tasks of varying difficulty, MD stimulates more neural activity and promotes
  stronger network connections in the brain. This study enhances the understanding
  of the neurological processes involved in robot-assisted parallel interactive tasks
  and may inform more effective robot-assisted rehabilitation therapies.'
