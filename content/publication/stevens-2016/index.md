abstract: "The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of a cooling strategy\
  \ designed to predominately lower thermal state with a strategy designed to lower\
  \ thermal sensation on endurance running performance and physiology in the heat.\
  \ Eleven moderately trained male runners completed familiarization and three randomized,\
  \ crossover 5-km running time trials on a non-motorized treadmill in hot conditions\
  \ (33 \xB0C). The trials included ice slurry ingestion before exercise (ICE), menthol\
  \ mouth rinse during exercise (MEN), and no intervention (CON). Running performance\
  \ was significantly improved with MEN (25.3 \xB1 3.5 min; P = 0.01), but not ICE\
  \ (26.3 \xB1 3.2 min; P = 0.45) when compared with CON (26.0 \xB1 3.4 min). Rectal\
  \ temperature was significantly decreased with ICE (by 0.3 \xB1 0.2 \xB0C; P < 0.01),\
  \ which persisted for 2 km of the run and MEN significantly decreased perceived\
  \ thermal sensation (between 4 and 5 km) and ventilation (between 1 and 2 km) during\
  \ the time trial. End-exercise blood prolactin concentration was elevated with MEN\
  \ compared with CON (by 25.1 \xB1 24.4 ng/mL; P = 0.02). The data demonstrate that\
  \ a change in the perception of thermal sensation during exercise from menthol mouth\
  \ rinse was associated with improved endurance running performance in the heat.\
  \ Ice slurry ingestion reduced core temperature but did not decrease thermal sensation\
  \ during exercise or improve running performance."
