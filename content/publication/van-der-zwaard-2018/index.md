abstract: "Optimizing physical performance is a major goal in current physiology.\
  \ However, basic understanding of combining high sprint and endurance performance\
  \ is currently lacking. This study identifies critical determinants of combined\
  \ sprint and endurance performance using multiple regression analyses of physiologic\
  \ determinants at different biologic levels. Cyclists, including 6 international\
  \ sprint, 8 team pursuit, and 14 road cyclists, completed a Wingate test and 15-km\
  \ time trialto obtain sprint and endurance performance results, respectively. Performancewas\
  \ normalized to lean body mass2/3 to eliminate the influence of body size. Performance\
  \ determinants were obtained from whole-body oxygen consumption, blood sampling,\
  \ knee-extensor maximal force, muscle oxygenation, whole-muscle morphology, and\
  \ muscle fiber histochemistry of musculus vastus lateralis. Normalized sprint performance\
  \ was explained by percentage of fast-type fibers and muscle volume (R2 = 0.65;\
  \ P <0.001) and normalized endurance performance by performance oxygen consumption\
  \ (Vo2), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and muscle oxygenation (R2 =\
  \ 0.92; P < 0.001). Combined sprint and endurance performance was explained by gross\
  \ efficiency, performance Vo2, and likely by muscle volume and fascicle length (P\
  \ = 0.056; P = 0.059). High performance Vo2 related to a high oxidative capacity,\
  \ high capillarization \xD7 myoglobin, and small physiologic cross-sectional area\
  \ (R2 = 0.67; P < 0.001). Results suggest that fascicle length and capillarization\
  \ are important targets for training to optimize sprint and endurance performance\
  \ simultaneously."
