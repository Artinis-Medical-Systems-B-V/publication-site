abstract: "Factors underlying the amplitude of exercise performance reduction at altitude\
  \ and the development of high-altitude illnesses are not completely understood.\
  \ To better describe these mechanisms, we assessed cardiorespiratory and tissue\
  \ oxygenation responses to hypoxia in elite high-altitude climbers. Eleven high-altitude\
  \ climbers were matched with 11 non-climber trained controls according to gender,\
  \ age, and fitness level (maximal oxygen consumption, VO2 max ). Subjects performed\
  \ two maximal incremental cycling tests, in normoxia and in hypoxia (inspiratory\
  \ oxygen fraction: 0.12). Cardiorespiratory measurements and tissue (cerebral and\
  \ muscle) oxygenation were assessed continuously. Hypoxic ventilatory and cardiac\
  \ responses were determined at rest and during exercise; hypercapnic ventilatory\
  \ response was determined at rest. In hypoxia, climbers exhibited similar reductions\
  \ to controls in VO2 max (climbers -39\u2009\xB1\u20097% vs controls -39\u2009\xB1\
  \u20099%), maximal power output (-27\u2009\xB1\u20095% vs -26\u2009\xB1\u20094%),\
  \ and arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2 ). However, climbers had lower hypoxic ventilatory\
  \ response during exercise (1.7\u2009\xB1\u20090.5 vs 2.6\u2009\xB1\u20090.7\u2009\
  L/min/%; P\u2009<\u20090.05) and lower hypercapnic ventilatory response (1.8\u2009\
  \xB1\u20091.4 vs 3.8\u2009\xB1\u20092.5\u2009mL/min/mmHg; P\u2009<\u20090.05). Finally,\
  \ climbers exhibited slower breathing frequency, larger tidal volume and larger\
  \ muscle oxygenation index. These results suggest that elite climbers show some\
  \ specific ventilatory and muscular responses to hypoxia possibly because of genetic\
  \ factors or adaptation to frequent high-altitude climbing."
