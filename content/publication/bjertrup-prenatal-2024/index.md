abstract: 'Background: Postpartum depression (PPD) affects 30–50% of women with a
  history of previous depression or bipolar disorder and 8% of women with no history
  of depression. Negative cognitive biases in the perception of infant cues and difficulties
  with emotion regulation are replicated risk factors. Current interventions focus
  on detecting and treating rather than preventing PPD. The aim of this randomized
  controlled intervention trial is therefore to investigate the potential prophylactic
  effects of prenatal affective cognitive training for pregnant women at heightened
  risk of PPD. Methods: The study will enrol a total of 292 pregnant women: 146 at
  high risk and 146 at low risk of PPD. Participants undergo comprehensive assessments
  of affective cognitive processing, clinical depressive symptoms, and complete questionnaires
  at baseline. Based on the responses, pregnant women will be categorized as either
  at high or low risk of PPD. High-risk participants will be randomized to either
  prenatal affective cognitive training (PACT) or care as usual (CAU) immediately
  after the baseline testing. The PACT intervention is based on emerging evidence
  for efficacy of affective cognitive training approaches in depression, including
  cognitive bias modification, attention bias modification, mindfulness-inspired emotion
  regulation exercises, and working memory training. Participants randomised to PACT
  will complete five individual computerised and virtual reality-based training sessions
  over 5 weeks. The primary outcome is the difference between intervention arms in
  the incidence of PPD, assessed with an interview 6 months after birth. We will also
  assess the severity of depressive symptoms, rated weekly online during the first
  6 weeks postpartum. Discussion: The results will have implications for future early
  prophylactic interventions for pregnant women at heightened risk of PPD. If the
  PACT intervention reduces the incidence of PPD, it can become a feasible, non-invasive
  prophylactic strategy during pregnancy, with positive mental health implications
  for these women and their children.'
