abstract: Abstract A subgroup of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 remain symptomatic
  over three months after infection. A distinctive symptom of patients with long COVID
  is post-exertional malaise, which is associated with a worsening of fatigue- and
  pain-related symptoms after acute mental or physical exercise, but its underlying
  pathophysiology is unclear. With this longitudinal case-control study (NCT05225688),
  we provide new insights into the pathophysiology of post-exertional malaise in patients
  with long COVID. We show that skeletal muscle structure is associated with a lower
  exercise capacity in patients, and local and systemic metabolic disturbances, severe
  exercise-induced myopathy and tissue infiltration of amyloid-containing deposits
  in skeletal muscles of patients with long COVID worsen after induction of post-exertional
  malaise. This study highlights novel pathways that help to understand the pathophysiology
  of post-exertional malaise in patients suffering from long COVID and other post-infectious
  diseases.
