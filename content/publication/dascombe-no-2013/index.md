abstract: "While the effect of lower body compression garments on performance and\
  \ physiological responses are well documented, no studies have examined the effect\
  \ of upper body compression garments (UBCG) on upper-body dominant exercise. This\
  \ study examined the effects of wearing UBCG on performance and physiological responses\
  \ during simulated flat-water kayaking. Five male (mean values\xB1s: 21.8\xB12.8\
  \ years; 83.5\xB19.2 kg; 63.0\xB15.5 ml\u02D9kg-1\u02D9min-1) and two female (mean\
  \ values\xB1s: 25.0\xB14.2 years; 71.4\xB12.7 kg; 51.0\xB14.8 ml\u02D9kg-1\u02D9\
  min-1) elite flat-water kayakers completed a six-step incremental test followed\
  \ by a four-minute maximal performance test (4minPT) in both UBCG and control (no\
  \ shirt or sports training bra) conditions in a randomized counter-balanced order.\
  \ Heart rate and oxygen consumption (O2) as well as performance measures (power,\
  \ distance covered, stroke rate) were recorded during the tests, and blood lactate\
  \ was measured immediately after each incremental step and three minutes following\
  \ the 4minPT. Near-infrared spectroscopy-derived measures of blood flow and oxygenation\
  \ of the flexor carpi radialis were monitored continuously for all tests. No significant\
  \ differences between the UBCG and control conditions were evident for any performance,\
  \ cardiorespiratory or oxygenation measure across the incremental step test and\
  \ 4minPT. It was concluded that wearing UBCG did not provide any significant physiological\
  \ or performance benefits during simulated flat-water kayaking. \xA9 2013 Copyright\
