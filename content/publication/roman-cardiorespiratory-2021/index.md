abstract: "Aim: The aim of the current study was to assess whether executive function\
  \ and prefrontal oxygenation are dependent on fitness level and age in older adults.\
  \ Methods: Twenty-four healthy males aged between 55 and 69 years old were recruited\
  \ for this study. They were stratified by age, leading to the creation of two groups:\
  \ 55\xE2\u20AC\u201C60 years old and 61\xE2\u20AC\u201C69 years old. A median split\
  \ based on CRF created higher- and lower-fit categories of participants. Cerebral\
  \ oxygenation was assessed using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during\
  \ a computerized Stroop task. Accuracy (% of correct responses) and reaction times\
  \ (ms) were used as behavioural indicators of cognitive performances. Changes in\
  \ oxygenated (\xE2\u02C6\u2020[HbO2]) and deoxygenated (\xE2\u02C6\u2020[HHb]) hemoglobin\
  \ were measured to capture neural changes. Repeated measures ANOVAs (CRF \xC3\u2014\
  \ Age \xC3\u2014 Stroop conditions) were performed to test the null hypothesis of\
  \ an absence of interaction between CRF, Age and executive performance. Results:\
  \ We also found an interaction between CRF and age on reaction times (p = .001),\
  \ in which higher fitness levels were related to faster reaction times in the 61\xE2\
  \u20AC\u201C69 year olds but not in the 55\xE2\u20AC\u201C60 year olds. Regarding\
  \ \xCE\u201DHHb, the ANOVA revealed a main effect of CRF in the right PFC (p = .04),\
  \ in which higher-fit participants had a greater \xCE\u201D[HHb] than the lower-fit\
  \ (d = 1.5). We also found fitness by age interaction for \xCE\u201D[HHb] in the\
  \ right PFC (p = .04). Conclusion: Our results support the positive association\
  \ of CRF on cerebral oxygenation and Stroop performance in healthy older males.\
  \ They indicated that high-fit individuals performed better in the 61\xE2\u20AC\u201C\
  69 year olds group, but not in the 55\xE2\u20AC\u201C60 years old group. We also\
  \ observed a greater PFC oxygenation change (as measured by \xCE\u201D[HHb]) in\
  \ the high-fit individuals."
