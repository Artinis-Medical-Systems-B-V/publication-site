abstract: "New Findings: What is the central question of this study? This study aimed\
  \ to determine the effect of ageing on cardiorespiratory and tissue oxygenation\
  \ responses to hypoxia during maximal incremental exercise. What is the main finding\
  \ and its importance? Older healthy subjects had preserved hypoxic cardiorespiratory\
  \ and tissue oxygenation responses at rest and during moderate exercise. At maximal\
  \ exercise, they had a reduced hypoxic ventilatory response but similar maximal\
  \ power output reduction compared with young individuals. This study suggests that\
  \ until moderate exercise, hypoxic responses are preserved until the age of 70\_\
  years and therefore that ageing is not a contraindication for high-altitude sojourn.\
  \ This study assessed the effects of ageing on cardiorespiratory and tissue oxygenation\
  \ responses to hypoxia both at rest and during incremental maximal exercise. Sixteen\
  \ young (20\u201330\_years old) and 15 older healthy subjects (60\u201370\_years\
  \ old) performed two maximal incremental cycling tests in normoxia and hypoxia (inspiratory\
  \ oxygen fraction 12%). Cardiorespiratory responses, prefrontal cortex and quadriceps\
  \ tissue oxygenation (near-infrared spectroscopy) were measured during exercise\
  \ as well as during hypercapnia at rest. The hypoxic ventilatory response was similar\
  \ in young compared with older individuals at rest and during moderate-intensity\
  \ exercise (50% maximal power output: young 0.9\_\xB1\_0.2 versus older 1.1\_\xB1\
  \_0.8 l\_min\u22121\_%\u22121; P\_>\_0.05) but larger in young subjects during high-intensity\
  \ exercise (maximal power output: 2.2\_\xB1\_0.8 versus 1.8\_\xB1\_1.1\_l\_min\u2212\
  1\_%\u22121; P\_<\_0.05). The hypoxic cardiac response did not differ between groups\
  \ both at rest and during exercise. During exercise in hypoxia, young subjects showed\
  \ greater deoxygenation than older subjects, at both the prefrontal cortex and quadriceps\
  \ levels. The hypoxia-induced reduction in maximal power output (young \u221232\_\
  \xB1\_5% versus older \u221230\_\xB1\_6%; P\_>\_0.05) and the hypercapnic responses\
  \ did not differ between groups. Older healthy and active individuals below the\
  \ age of 70\_years have cardiorespiratory and tissue oxygenation responses to hypoxia\
  \ similar to young individuals both at rest and during moderate-intensity exercise.\
  \ Despite a lower hypoxic ventilatory response at maximal exercise, older individuals\
  \ have similar oxygen desaturation and maximal power output reduction compared with\
  \ young subjects."
