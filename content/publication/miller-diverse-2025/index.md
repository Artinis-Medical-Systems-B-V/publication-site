abstract: Background Theta Burst Stimulation (TBS) is a form of non-invasive brain
  stimulation that can induce neuroplastic changes in the underlying intracortical
  areas. It has significant potential in clinical and research settings for modulating
  cognitive and motor performance. Little is known about how TBS affects oxygenations
  levels within and across brain hemispheres during stimulation of the Dorsolateral
  Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC). This study aimed to investigate blood oxygenation levels
  in the DLPFC during TBS, using concurrent functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy
  (fNIRS). Methods 44 young adults completed within-subjects 2 × 2 design with 4 conditions
  that included intermittent TBS (iTBS), and continuous TBS (cTBS) stimulation applied
  to the left and right DLPFC. FNIRS was recorded concurrently, with 12 optode channels
  spanning across the left, medial and right prefrontal cortex. Results Findings focused
  on corrected significant effects that revealed clear neurovascular coupling during
  stimulation. Right hemisphere iTBS stimulation on the DLPFC resulted in excitation
  within and between hemispheres as expected, however left hemisphere stimulation
  decreased oxygenation levels both ipsilaterally and contralaterally. CTBS on the
  right and left hemisphere revealed reductions in HbO as expected in support of previous
  literature and potential LTD-like effects. Conclusion This is the first study to
  show the extent and dispersion of blood-oxygenation changes in the ipsilateral and
  contralateral hemispheres during excitatory and inhibitory TBS applied to the DLPFC.
  The findings demonstrate that TMS stimulation may originate from more global and
  interhemispheric effects, but that iTBS on the left-DLPFC induces decreases in oxygenated
  haemoglobin (HbO) providing the potential links for beneficial effects in cognition.
