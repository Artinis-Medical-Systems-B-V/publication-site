abstract: 'Objective: To investigate the agonist and antagonist muscles implication
  during a prolonged trunk extension exercise and to determine the relationship with
  paraspinal muscle metabolic and hemodynamic responses in healthy individuals. Methods:
  Sixteen young and healthy subjects performed a 5-minute exercise of trunk extension.
  During the exercise, the paraspinal muscle deoxygenation was assessed using near
  infrared spectroscopy. Electromyography was used to assess the neuromuscular function
  of paraspinal muscles, biceps femoris, gastrocnemii and rectus abdominis. Results:
  There were increases in paraspinal muscle deoxygenation (P textless 0.001). There
  was solely a non-significant trend concerning the increase in electromyographic
  signals amplitude in paraspinal muscle (P textgreater 0.05), whereas it decreased
  in biceps femoris (P = 0.001) and in the left gastrocnemius (P = 0.002), and it
  increased in rectus abdominis (P = 0.023). Electromyographic signals amplitude in
  paraspinal muscle, biceps femoris and gastrocnemii were correlated with paraspinal
  muscles deoxygenation (P textless 0.001). Conclusion: The correlations imply that
  the greater local deoxygenation was; the greater the agonist and co-agonist muscles
  were involved. Also, the biceps femoris, the gastrocnemii and the rectus abdominis
  presented neuromuscular fatigue manifestations. This suggests that these agonist
  and antagonist muscles to trunk extension were significantly involved. This should
  be considered for the prevention of lower back muscle fatigue and to prevent injuries.'
