abstract: "Background Muscle wasting is frequent in chronic obstructive lung disease\
  \ (COPD) and associated with low branched-chain amino acids (BCAA). We hypothesized\
  \ that BCAA supplementation could potentiate the effect of a pulmonary rehabilitation\
  \ program (PRP) by inducing muscular change.  Materials and methods Sixty COPD patients\
  \ (GOLD 2\xE2\u20AC\u201C3) were involved in an ambulatory 4-week PRP either with\
  \ BCAA oral daily supplementation or placebo daily supplementation in a randomized\
  \ double-blind design. Maximal exercise test including quadriceps oxygenation measurements,\
  \ functional exercise test, muscle strength, lung function tests, body composition,\
  \ dyspnea and quality of life were assessed before and after PRP.  Results Fifty-four\
  \ patients (64.9 \xC2\xB1 8.3 years) completed the protocol. In both groups, maximal\
  \ exercise capacity, functional and muscle performances, quality of life and dyspnea\
  \ were improved after 4-week PRP (p \xE2\u2030\xA4 0.01). Changes in muscle oxygenation\
  \ during the maximal exercise and recovery period were not modified after 4-week\
  \ PRP in BCAA group. Contrarily, in the placebo group the muscle oxygenation kinetic\
  \ of recovery was slowed down after PRP.  Conclusion This study demonstrated that\
  \ a 4-week PRP with BCAA supplementation is not more beneficial than PRP alone for\
  \ patients. A longer duration of supplementation or a more precise targeting of\
  \ patients would need to be investigated to validate an effect on muscle recovery\
  \ and to demonstrate other beneficial effects."
