abstract: "Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging\
  \ (fMRI) both allow non-invasive monitoring of cerebral cortical oxygenation responses\
  \ to various stimuli. To compare these methods in elderly subjects and to determine\
  \ the effect of age on cortical oxygenation responses, we determined motor-task-related\
  \ changes in deoxyhemoglobin concentration ([HHb]) over the left motor cortex in\
  \ six healthy young subjects (age 35 \xB1 9 years, mean \xB1 SD) and five healthy\
  \ elderly subjects (age 73 \xB1 3 years) by NIRS and blood-oxygen-level-dependent\
  \ (BOLD) fMRI simultaneously. The motor-task consisted of seven cycles of 20-sec\
  \ periods of contralateral finger-tapping at a rate as fast as possible alternated\
  \ with 40-sec periods of rest. Time-locked averages over the seven cycles were used\
  \ for further analysis. Task-related decreases in [HHb] over the motor cortex were\
  \ measured by NIRS, with maximum changes of -0.83 \xB1 0.38 $\u03BC$mol/L (P < 0.01)\
  \ for the young and -0.32 \xB1 0.17 $\u03BC$mol/L (P < 0.05) for the elderly subjects.\
  \ The BOLD-fMRI signal increased over the cortex volume under investigation with\
  \ NIRS, with maximum changes of 2.11 \xB1 0.72% (P < 0.01) for the young and 1.75\
  \ \xB1 0.71% (P < 0.01) for the elderly subjects. NIRS and BOLD-fMRI measurements\
  \ showed good correlation in the young (r = -0.70, r2 = 0.48, P < 0.001) and elderly\
  \ subjects (r = -0.82, r2 = 0.67, P < 0.001). Additionally, NIRS measurements demonstrated\
  \ age-dependent decreases in task-related cerebral oxygenation responses (P < 0.05),\
  \ whereas fMRI measurements demonstrated smaller areas of cortical activation in\
  \ the elderly subjects (P < 0.05). These findings demonstrate that NIRS and fMRI\
  \ similarly assess cortical oxygenation changes in young subjects and also in elderly\
  \ subjects. In addition, cortical oxygenation responses to brain activation alter\
  \ with aging. \xA9 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
