abstract: "Introduction: Executive functions play a fundamental role in walking by\
  \ integrating information from cognitive-motor pathways. Subtle changes in brain\
  \ and behavior may help identify older adults who are more susceptible to executive\
  \ function deficits with advancing age due to prefrontal cortex deterioration. This\
  \ study aims to examine how older adults mitigate executive demands while walking\
  \ during cognitively demanding tasks. Methods: Twenty healthy older adults (M\_\
  =\_71.8\_years, SD\_=\_6.4) performed simple reaction time (SRT), go/no-go (GNG),\
  \ n-back (NBK), and double number sequence (DNS) cognitive tasks of increasing difficulty\
  \ while walking (i.e., dual task). Functional near infra-red spectroscopy (fNIRS)\
  \ was used to measure the hemodynamic response (i.e., oxy- [HbO2] and deoxyhemoglobin\
  \ [HbR]) changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during dual and single tasks (i.e.,\
  \ walking alone). In addition, performance was measured using gait speed (m/s),\
  \ response time (s), and accuracy (% correct). Results: Using repeated measures\
  \ ANOVAs, neural findings demonstrated a main effect of task such that \u2206HbO2\
  \ (p\_=.047) and \u2206HbR (p\_=.040) decreased between single and dual tasks. An\
  \ interaction between task and cognitive difficulty (p\_=.014) revealed that gait\
  \ speed decreased in the DNS between single and dual tasks. A main effect of task\
  \ in response time indicated that the SRT response time was faster than all other\
  \ difficulty levels (p\_<.001). Accuracy performance declined between single and\
  \ dual tasks (p\_=.028) and across difficulty levels (p\_<.001) but was not significantly\
  \ different between the NBK and DNS. Conclusion: Findings suggest that a healthy\
  \ older adult sample might mitigate executive demands using an automatic locomotor\
  \ control strategy such that shifting conscious attention away from walking during\
  \ the dual tasks resulted in decreased \u2206HbO2 and \u2206HbR. However, decreased\
  \ prefrontal activation was inefficient at maintaining response time and accuracy\
  \ performance and may be differently affected by increasing cognitive demands."
