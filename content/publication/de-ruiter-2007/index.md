abstract: "PURPOSE: We investigated the knee-extensor torque at which reoxygenation\
  \ (inflow of arterial blood) during an isometric contraction stopped, whether this\
  \ torque depended on maximal torque capacity (MTC), and whether there were differences\
  \ among the synergists. METHODS: Isometric knee-extension torque was measured using\
  \ a dynamometer with 90\xB0angles in the hip and knee. Maximal voluntary activation\
  \ (established with superimposed nerve stimulation) was > 90% in the 15 healthy\
  \ male subjects (20-30 yr). Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to measure\
  \ changes in muscle oxygenation of the vastus medialis (VM), vastus lateralis (VL),\
  \ and rectus femoris (RF) muscle during submaximal isometric contractions at intensities\
  \ of 20-45% MTC with 5% increments, applied in randomized order and divided over\
  \ 2 d. At each torque, a contraction with an inflated pressure cuff (450 mm Hg),\
  \ inducing full arterial occlusion, was followed (10 min of rest) by a second contraction\
  \ without the cuff. RESULTS: MTC ranged from 178 to 348 N\u02D9m. The torque at\
  \ which maximal deoxygenation (all oxygen consumed) during contraction without the\
  \ cuff became similar (P < 0.05) to the maximal deoxygenation reached with the cuff\
  \ (indicative for complete occlusion of blood flow during the contraction without\
  \ the cuff) was significantly higher for the RF (35% MTC) than for both vasti (25%\
  \ MTC). There was no significant relation between MTC and relative (% MTC) torque\
  \ at which muscle reoxygenation stopped. CONCLUSION: Knee-extensor reoxygenation\
  \ stopped at lower torques than previously reported for blood flow in this muscle,\
  \ and this occurred at the same % MTC in subjects of different strength but at different\
  \ % MTC for the different synergists. \xA92007The American College of Sports Medicine."
