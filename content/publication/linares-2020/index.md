abstract: "Exposure of biological tissue to photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) seems\
  \ to increase the oxygen availability and mitochondrial electrochemical activity.\
  \ With the advancement of new technologies, such as near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS),\
  \ information can be obtained about the balance between oxygen utilization and delivery\
  \ by assessing local oxy- ([O2Hb]) and deoxy-myohemoglobin ([HHb]) concentrations,\
  \ both measured in micromolars ($\u03BC$M). Consequently, NIRS can be used to study\
  \ (\u201Cin vivo\u201D) PBMT effects on the oxidative system, including oxygen availability.\
  \ Thus, the main objective of the present study was to use NIRS to investigate the\
  \ acute effects of PBMT by light-emitting diode (LED) on the oxygen delivery and\
  \ utilization in humans. Twelve healthy young participants were treated with a LED\
  \ device (850\_nm, 50\_mW, 2\_J) and placebo applied over the proximal third of\
  \ the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle of the left or right forearm selected in a random\
  \ order. The LED was applied in direct contact with skin and the device was switched\
  \ on for 40\_s in 4 different interventions (I1, I2, I3 and I4) with a 3-min interval\
  \ between interventions. The placebo condition was considered as the period before\
  \ the first PBMT. The NIRS device was used to evaluate the relative changes in [O2Hb]\
  \ and [HHb] before and after placebo and interventions. We found that PBMT statistically\
  \ increased the [O2Hb] in 0.39\_$\u03BC$M. These results demonstrate the potential\
  \ of PBMT to increase oxygen availability."
