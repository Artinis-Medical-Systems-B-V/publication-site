abstract: Aim To investigate central and peripheral nervous system activity and muscle
  oxygenation in athletes during repeated-sprint exercise in normoxia and normobaric
  hypoxia. Methods The effects on vastus lateralis muscle strength in a cross-over
  study were examined in 18 athletes (13 males, 5 females) completing 10 × 6-s cycle
  sprints. Immediately after and again 5 minutes post-exercise, electromyography (EMG),
  heart rate variability, maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), muscle oxygenation,
  peak power output, and arterial oxygen saturation were compared to 2 baseline sets
  named (“Baseline” and “Pre”). Results Post-exercise MVC was significantly lower
  (6.7 ± 10.0%) than Baseline, but root-mean-square amplitude during hypoxia (all-times)
  was significantly lower than normoxia (0.38 ± 0.19 vs 0.41 ± 0.17 mV). Comparative
  frequency analysis of the percentage change in pre- to post-exercise EMG area, at
  low 1–29 hz (type-1 fibre) and high 75–100 hz (type-2 fibre) areas, revealed a significant
  reduction in type-1 fibre activity relative to type-2, by 20–30% across time and
  by 10% in type-1 activity between conditions. Conclusion Exercise in hypoxia appeared
  to cause a temporary increase in central sympathetic nervous system activity and
  greater recruitment of type-2 muscle fibres, with accompanying reduction in type-1.
  Acute hypoxia may stimulate type-2 fibre conditioning.
