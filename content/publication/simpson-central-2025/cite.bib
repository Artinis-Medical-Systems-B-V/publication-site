To investigate central and peripheral nervous system activity and muscle oxygenation in athletes during repeated-sprint exercise in normoxia and normobaric hypoxia.
Methods
The effects on vastus lateralis muscle strength in a cross-over study were examined in 18 athletes (13 males, 5 females) completing 10 × 6-s cycle sprints. Immediately after and again 5 minutes post-exercise, electromyography (EMG), heart rate variability, maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), muscle oxygenation, peak power output, and arterial oxygen saturation were compared to 2 baseline sets named (“Baseline” and “Pre”).
Results
Post-exercise MVC was significantly lower (6.7 ± 10.0%) than Baseline, but root-mean-square amplitude during hypoxia (all-times) was significantly lower than normoxia (0.38 ± 0.19 vs 0.41 ± 0.17 mV). Comparative frequency analysis of the percentage change in pre- to post-exercise EMG area, at low 1–29 hz (type-1 fibre) and high 75–100 hz (type-2 fibre) areas, revealed a significant reduction in type-1 fibre activity relative to type-2, by 20–30% across time and by 10% in type-1 activity between conditions.
Conclusion
Exercise in hypoxia appeared to cause a temporary increase in central sympathetic nervous system activity and greater recruitment of type-2 muscle fibres, with accompanying reduction in type-1. Acute hypoxia may stimulate type-2 fibre conditioning.},
