abstract: "Currently, oxygen uptake (VO2) is the most precise means of investigating\
  \ aerobic fitness and level of physical activity; however, VO2 can only be directly\
  \ measured in supervised conditions. With the advancement of new wearable sensor\
  \ technologies and data processing approaches, it is possible to accurately infer\
  \ work rate and predict VO2 during activities of daily living (ADL). The main objective\
  \ of this study was to develop and verify the methods required to predict and investigate\
  \ the VO2 dynamics during ADL. The variables derived from the wearable sensors were\
  \ used to create a predictor based on a random forest method. The VO2 temporal dynamics\
  \ were assessed by the mean normalized gain amplitude (MNG) obtained from frequency\
  \ domain analysis. The MNG provides a means to assess aerobic fitness. The predicted\
  \ VO2 during ADL was strongly correlated (r = 0.87, P < 0.001) with the measured\
  \ VO2 and the prediction bias was 0.2 ml\u02D9min-1 \u02D9kg-1. The MNG calculated\
  \ based on predicted VO2 was strongly correlated (r = 0.71, P < 0.001) with MNG\
  \ calculated based on measured VO2 data. This new technology provides an important\
  \ advance in ambulatory and continuous assessment of aerobic fitness with potential\
  \ for future applications such as the early detection of deterioration of physical\
  \ health."
