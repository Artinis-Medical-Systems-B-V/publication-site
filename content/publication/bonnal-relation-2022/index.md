abstract: 'Force and effort are important components of a motor task that can impact
  rehabilitation effectiveness. However, few studies have evaluated the impact of
  these factors on cortical activation during gait. The purpose of the study was to
  investigate the relation between cortical activation and effort required during
  exoskeleton-mediated gait at different levels of physical assistance in healthy
  individuals. Twenty-four healthy participants walked 10 m with an exoskeleton that
  provided four levels of assistance: 100%, 50%, 0%, and 25% resistance. Functional
  near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to measure cerebral flow dynamics with
  a 20-channel (plus two reference channels) device that covered most cortical motor
  regions bilaterally. We measured changes in oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) and deoxyhemoglobin
  (HbR). According to HbO2 levels, cortical activation only differed slightly between
  the assisted conditions and rest. In contrast, bilateral and widespread cortical
  activation occurred during the two unassisted conditions (somatosensory, somatosensory
  association, primary motor, premotor, and supplementary motor cortices). A similar
  pattern was seen for HbR levels, with a smaller number of significant channels than
  for HbO2. These results confirmed the hypothesis that there is a relation between
  cortical activation and level of effort during gait. This finding should help to
  optimize neurological rehabilitation strategies to drive neuroplasticity.'
