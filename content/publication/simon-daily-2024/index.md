abstract: 'Background: The interaction between physical activity, skeletal muscle
  health, and adiposity has been explored in normal weight and overweight/obesity
  grouped together; however, the overall risks associated with being overweight are
  less than those observed with obesity and can be confounded by disparities in both
  sex and race. Thus, the present study sought to investigate the intricate interplay
  of daily physical activity and skeletal muscle oxidative capacity (SMOC) in overweight
  and obesity, while exploring how sex and race impact this dynamic relationship.
  Methods: One hundred and forty participants were grouped by body mass index (BMI)
  as overweight (n = 73; BMI textgreater25–textless30 kg/m2) or obese (n = 67; BMI
  ≥30 kg/m2). SMOC was assessed using near‐infrared spectroscopy and daily physical
  activity was assessed for 7 days using accelerometry. Results: Overweight individuals
  exhibited a higher (p = 0.004) SMOC and engaged in more (p = 0.007) vigorous physical
  activity compared to obese individuals. In addition, SMOC was lower (p = 0.005)
  in obese non‐Hispanic Black (NHB) men compared to overweight NHB men. No relationships
  between physical activity and SMOC were observed. Conclusion: Physical activity
  is not associated with differences in SMOC in overweight and obesity. Obese individuals
  engage in less vigorous physical activity and exhibit lower SMOC compared to overweight
  individuals and these differences are emphasised in NHB men.'
