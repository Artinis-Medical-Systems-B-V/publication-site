abstract: "This study tested the hypothesis that a novel, gravity-induced blood flow\
  \ restricted (BFR) aerobic exercise (AE) model will result in greater activation\
  \ of the AMPK\u2013PGC-1$\u03B1$ pathway compared with work rate-matched non-BFR.\
  \ Thirteen healthy males (age: 22.4 \xB1 3.0 years; peak oxygen uptake: 42.4 \xB1\
  \ 7.3 mL/(kg\u02D9min)) completed two 30-min work rate-matched bouts of cycling\
  \ performed with their legs below (CTL) and above their heart (BFR) at $\u03B1$2\
  \ weeks apart. Muscle biopsies were taken before, immediately, and 3 h after exercise.\
  \ Blood was drawn before and immediately after exercise. Our novel gravity-induced\
  \ BFR model led to less muscle oxygenation during BFR compared with CTL (O2Hb: P\
  \ = 0.01; HHb: P < 0.01) and no difference in muscle activation (p = 0.53). Plasma\
  \ epinephrine increased following both BFR and CTL (p < 0.01); however, only norepinephrine\
  \ increased more following BFR (p < 0.01). PGC-1$\u03B1$ messenger RNA (mRNA) increased\
  \ more following BFR ($\u03B1$6-fold) compared with CTL ($\u03B1$4-fold; p = 0.036).\
  \ VEGFA mRNA increased (p < 0.01) similarly following BFR and CTL (p = 0.21), and\
  \ HIF-1$\u03B1$ mRNA did not increase following either condition (p = 0.21). Phosphorylated\
  \ acetyl-coenzymeAcarboxylase (ACC) increased more following BFR (p<0.035) whereas\
  \ p-PKA substrates, p-p38 MAPK, and acetyl-p53 increased (p < 0.05) similarly following\
  \ both conditions (p > 0.05). In conclusion, gravity-induced BFR is a viable BFR\
  \ model that demonstrated an important role of AMPK signalling on augmenting PGC-1$\u03B1\
  $ mRNA. Novelty \u2022 Gravity-induced BFR AE reduced muscle oxygenation without\
  \ impacting muscle activation, advancing gravity-induced BFR as a simple, inexpensive\
  \ BFR model. \u2022 Gravity-induced BFR increased PGC-1$\u03B1$ mRNA and ACC phosphorylation\
  \ more than work rate-matched non-BFR AE. \u2022 This is the first BFR AE study\
  \ to concurrently measure blood catecholamines, muscle activation, and muscle oxygenation."
