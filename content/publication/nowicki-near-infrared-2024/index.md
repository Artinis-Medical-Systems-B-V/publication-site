abstract: Bone fractures are associated with hypoxia, but no longitudinal studies
  of perfusion measurements in human patients have been reported despite the clinical
  and research potential. In this longitudinal observational cohort study, the near-infrared
  spectroscopy (NIRS) device PortaMon was used to assess oxy-(O2Hb), deoxy-(HHb) and
  total (tHb) haemoglobin, as well as the differences between O2Hb and HHb (HbDiff)
  and the tissue saturation index (TSI) at three different depths in the fracture
  gap. Linear mixed effect models were fitted to analyse time effects. One-way ANOVAs
  were conducted to compare groups. The time points corresponding to minima were calculated
  via linear regression. In this study, 11 patients with tibial shaft fractures underwent
  longitudinal measurements. Additionally, 9 patients with diagnosed tibial shaft
  nonunion and 23 age-matched controls were measured once. In the longitudinal group,
  all fractures healed, and decreases in O2Hb and HbDiff (all p textless 0.05) were
  observed, with minima occurring 19â€“21 days after fracture. O2Hb values in nonunion
  patients did not differ from the minima in longitudinally measured union patients,
  whereas differences in HHb and tHb were significant (all p textless 0.05). Previously,
  the onset of hypoxia has been assumed to be much faster. The characteristic trajectories
  of the NIRS parameters O2Hb and HbDiff can be used to fulfil the need for a non-invasive
  method to monitor fracture healing. These results suggest that NIRS could supplement
  radiographs and clinical impressions in daily clinical practice and may enable earlier
  diagnosis of nonunion.
