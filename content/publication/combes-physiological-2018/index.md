abstract: "VO2 fluctuations are argued to be an important mechanism underpinning chronic\
  \ adaptations following interval training. We compared the effect of exercise modality,\
  \ continuous vs. intermittent realized at a same intensity, on electrical muscular\
  \ activity, muscular oxygenation and on whole body oxygen uptake. Twelve participants\
  \ (24 \xB1 5 years; VO2peak: 43 \xB1 6 mL\u02D9 min\u22121\u02D9kg\u22121) performed\
  \ (i) an incremental test to exhaustion to determine peak work rate (WRpeak); two\
  \ randomized isocaloric exercises at 70%WRpeak; (ii) 1 bout of 30 min; (iii) 30\
  \ bouts of 1 min work intercepted with 1 min passive recovery. For electromyography,\
  \ only the CON exercise showed change for the vastus lateralis root-mean-square\
  \ (+6.4 \xB1 5.1%, P <.01, 95%CI 3.2, 8.3) and mean power frequency (\u22125.2 \xB1\
  \ 4.8, P <.01, 95%CI \u22128.2, \u22123.5). Metabolic fluctuations (i.e. Oxygen\
  \ Fluctuation Index and HHb Fluctuation Index) were higher in the intermittent modality,\
  \ while post-exercise blood lactate concentrations (4.80 \xB1 1.50 vs. 2.32 \xB1\
  \ 1.21 mM, respectively, for the CON and INT, P <.01, 95%CI 1.72, 3.12) and the\
  \ time spent over 90% of VO2 target (1644 \xB1 152 vs. 356 \xB1 301 sec, respectively,\
  \ for the CON and INT, P <.01, 95%CI 1130, 1446) were higher in the continuous modality.\
  \ In conclusion, despite a similar energy expenditure and intensity, intermittent\
  \ and continuous exercises showed two very different physiological responses. The\
  \ intermittent modality would lead to a larger recruitment of fast twitch fibres\
  \ that are less mitochondria-equipped and therefore may be more likely respondent\
  \ to mitochondrial adaptations. In addition, this modality induces greater metabolic\
  \ variations, a stimulus who could lead to mitochondrial development."
