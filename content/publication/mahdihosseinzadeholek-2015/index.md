abstract: "Hosseinzadeh, M, Andersen, OK, Arendt-Nielsen, L, Samani, A, Kamavuako,\
  \ EN, and Madeleine, P. Adaptation of local muscle blood flow and surface electromyography\
  \ to repeated bouts of eccentric exercise. J Strength Cond Res 29(4): 1017-1026,\
  \ 2015 - The aim of this randomized controlled crossover study was to investigate\
  \ the effect of a bout of unaccustomed eccentric exercise (ECC) followed by a consecutive\
  \ bout of the same intensity on local muscle blood flow, amplitude, and frequency\
  \ of the electromyographic (EMG) signal from the exercised tibialis anterior muscle.\
  \ Sixteen healthy male participants (age, 25.7 (0.6) years; body mass index 24.8\
  \ (1) kg\u02D9m -2) participated in this study. Two identical bouts of high-intensity\
  \ ECC were performed on the tibialis anterior muscle 7 days apart. Control sessions\
  \ involving no exercise were performed 4 weeks either before or after the exercise\
  \ sessions. Changes in local total blood flow [$\u0394$tHb], EMG root mean square,\
  \ and median power frequency were recorded during isometric maximum voluntary contraction\
  \ of ankle dorsiflexion. Measurements were performed before, immediately after,\
  \ and the day after both ECCs (ECC1 and ECC2). The participants rested quietly in\
  \ a chair in the control session. Eccentric exercise 1 led to a significant decrease\
  \ in [$\u0394$tHb] on the day after (p \u2264 0.05), whereas ECC2 did not. Median\
  \ power frequency decreased significantly in ECC2 compared with ECC1 (p < 0.01).\
  \ Root mean square was unchanged in all the instants. The present study showed that\
  \ adaptation is depicted in the local muscle blood flow and the frequency contents\
  \ of the EMG after an unaccustomed ECC inducing muscle soreness. These alterations\
  \ provide a potential mechanism for a rapid adaptation, which decreases susceptibility\
  \ of the muscle to develop further soreness in the subsequent ECC bout."
