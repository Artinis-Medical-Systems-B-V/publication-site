 abstract = {This study examined the effects of Sprint Interval Cycling (SIT) on muscle oxygenation kinetics and performance during the 30-15 intermittent fitness test (IFT). Twenty-five women hockey players of Olympic standard were randomly selected into an experimental group (EXP) and a control group (CON). The EXP group performed six additional SIT sessions over six weeks in addition to their normal training program. To explore the potential training-induced change, EXP subjects additionally completed 5 x 30s maximal intensity cycle testing before and after training. During these tests near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measured parameters; oxyhaemoglobin + oxymyoglobin (HbO2+ MbO2), tissue deoxyhaemoglobin + deoxymyoglobin (HHb+HMb), total tissue haemoglobin (tHb) and tissue oxygenation (TSI %) were taken. In the EXP group (5.34±0.14 to 5.50±0.14m.s-1) but not the CON group (pre = 5.37± 0.27 to 5.39±0.30m.s-1) significant changes were seen in the 30-15IFTperformance. EXP group also displayed significant post-training increases during the sprint cycling: $Δ$TSI (-7.59±0.91 to -12.16±2.70%); $Δ$HHb+HMb (35.68±6.67 to 69.44 ±26.48$μ$M.cm); and $Δ$HbO2+ MbO2 (-74.29±13.82 to -109.36±22.61$μ$M.cm). No significant differences were seen in $Δ$tHb (-45.81±15.23 to -42.93±16.24). NIRS is able to detect positive peripheral muscle oxygenation changes when used during a SIT protocol which has been shown to be an effective training modality within elite athletes.},
