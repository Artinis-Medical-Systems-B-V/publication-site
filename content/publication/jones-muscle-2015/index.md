abstract: "This study examined the effects of Sprint Interval Cycling (SIT) on muscle\
  \ oxygenation kinetics and performance during the 30-15 intermittent fitness test\
  \ (IFT). Twenty-five women hockey players of Olympic standard were randomly selected\
  \ into an experimental group (EXP) and a control group (CON). The EXP group performed\
  \ six additional SIT sessions over six weeks in addition to their normal training\
  \ program. To explore the potential training-induced change, EXP subjects additionally\
  \ completed 5 x 30s maximal intensity cycle testing before and after training. During\
  \ these tests near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measured parameters; oxyhaemoglobin\
  \ + oxymyoglobin (HbO2+ MbO2), tissue deoxyhaemoglobin + deoxymyoglobin (HHb+HMb),\
  \ total tissue haemoglobin (tHb) and tissue oxygenation (TSI %) were taken. In the\
  \ EXP group (5.34\xB10.14 to 5.50\xB10.14m.s-1) but not the CON group (pre = 5.37\xB1\
  \ 0.27 to 5.39\xB10.30m.s-1) significant changes were seen in the 30-15IFTperformance.\
  \ EXP group also displayed significant post-training increases during the sprint\
  \ cycling: $\u0394$TSI (-7.59\xB10.91 to -12.16\xB12.70%); $\u0394$HHb+HMb (35.68\xB1\
  6.67 to 69.44 \xB126.48$\u03BC$M.cm); and $\u0394$HbO2+ MbO2 (-74.29\xB113.82 to\
  \ -109.36\xB122.61$\u03BC$M.cm). No significant differences were seen in $\u0394\
  $tHb (-45.81\xB115.23 to -42.93\xB116.24). NIRS is able to detect positive peripheral\
  \ muscle oxygenation changes when used during a SIT protocol which has been shown\
  \ to be an effective training modality within elite athletes."
