abstract: 'This study aimed to evaluate whether cerebral oxygenation of the prefrontal
  cortex and associative-dissociative focus while completing the task mediate changes
  in cognition during exercise. Seventy-five young college-aged adults participated
  in this within-subjects randomized cross-over two-arm experimental design. During
  each session, participants completed a Stroop task four separate times: at baseline,
  two times during the exercise session, and at post-test. The experimental arm session
  involved participants cycling first at a moderate intensity, followed by cycling
  at a vigorous intensity. The active control arm session involved participants cycling
  at a very light intensity to ensure any effects were attributable to the level of
  exertion rather than the control of motor coordination. Cerebral oxygenation of
  the prefrontal cortex was assessed using fNIRS, while associate-dissociate attention
  was assessed using a self-report scale to provide insight into two hypothesized
  mechanisms which may contribute to alterations in cognition during exercise. Replicating
  well-established findings, results showed that during vigorous-intensity exercise,
  accuracy rates decreased for the most cognitively demanding conditions of the Stroop
  task, while reaction times were generally shorter compared to baseline. Neither
  shifting of attention in response to the dual-task nor prefrontal cortex oxygenation
  were observed to mediate cognitive deficits associated with vigorous exercise.'
