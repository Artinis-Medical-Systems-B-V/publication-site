abstract: Introduction Feelings of fatigue are reduced after a session of continuous
  exercise of low-to-moderate intensity lasting 20 min or more, but only when feelings
  of energy are increased. Feelings of fatigue and energy have not been described
  after fatiguing, high-intensity interval exercise. Cerebral oxygenation has been
  implicated as a central correlate of fatigability, but it has not been studied concurrent
  with perceived fatigue during or after exercise. Methods Fifteen recreationally
  active participants (8 women, 7 men) completed bouts of sprint interval cycling
  (four, 30-s all-out sprints each followed by 4 min of active recovery) and a time-
  and work-matched bout of constant resistance cycling. Oxygenation (oxygenated hemoglobin
  [HbO2]) and deoxygenation (deoxygenated hemoglobin [HHb]) in the dorsolateral prefrontal
  cortex were measured using near-infrared spectroscopy. Fatigue ratings during each
  sprint and feelings of fatigue and energy during recovery were assessed. Results
  Increases in HbO2 and HHb in frontal cortex were greater during sprint cycling than
  during constant resistance cycling (P = 0.001). Fatigability (decreased power output)
  increased over successive sprints (P = 0.001). About 95% of the increase in fatigue
  ratings across sprints (P < 0.001) was accounted for by fatigability and cortical
  HbO2. Feelings of fatigue were decreased (P < 0.001) and feelings of energy were
  increased (P < 0.05) across sprint recovery periods but were unchanged during constant
  resistance cycling. About 85% of the changes in feelings of fatigue or energy during
  recovery were explained by fatigue ratings across sprints and maximum HbO2 in the
  cortex during recovery. Conclusion Repeated, high-intensity sprints were fatiguing,
  but paradoxical reductions in feelings of fatigue and increases in feelings of energy
  occurred during recovery that were accounted for by ratings of fatigue during exercise
  and oxygenation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during recovery.
