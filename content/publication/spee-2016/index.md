abstract: Oxygen uptake (V? O2) kinetics are prolonged in patients with chronic heart
  failure (CHF). This may be caused by impaired oxygen delivery or skeletal muscle
  derangements. We investigated whether impaired cardiac output (Q? ) kinetics limit
  skeletal muscle oxygen delivery relative to the metabolic demands at submaximal
  exercise in CHF patients by evaluating the relation between Q ? kinetics and skeletal
  muscle deoxygenation. Forty-three CHF patients, NYHA II-III, performed a constant-load
  exercise test at 80% of the ventilatory aerobic threshold (VAT) to assessV ? O2
  kinetics (V ? O2). Q ? kinetics (Q ? ) were assessed by a radial artery pulse contour
  analysis method. Skeletal muscle deoxygenation was assessed by near infrared spectroscopy
  at the m. vastus lateralis, using the minimal value of the tissue saturation index
  during onset of exercise (TSImin). Patients were categorized in slow and normal
  Q ? responders relative to metabolic demands (Q ? /V? O2 1 and Q ? /V? O2 1, respectively),
  Q ? (62 29 s), and V ? O2 (60 21 s) were significantly related (r 0.66, P 0.001).
  There was a significant correlation between Q ? and TSImin in the slow Q ? responders
  [rs-0.57, P 0.005, n 22 (51%)]. In conclusion, in moderately impaired CHF patients
  with relatively slowQ ? kinetics, central hemodynamics may limit skeletal muscle
  oxygenation during moderate-intensity exercise.
