abstract: "Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that a repeated\
  \ bout of eccentric exercise (ECC2) would result in smaller increase in the sensitivity\
  \ of spinal nociceptive system, and smaller decrease in the local muscle blood oxygenation\
  \ response in both the ipsilateral and the contralateral tibialis anterior muscle\
  \ (TA) when compared with the initial bout (ECC1). It was hypothesized that the\
  \ magnitude of the repeated bout effect (RBE) would be greater for the ipsilateral\
  \ side than the contralateral side. Methods: Twenty-six healthy young men performed\
  \ two bouts of high-intensity eccentric exercise of TA separated by 2 weeks. Half\
  \ of the participants used the same leg for both bouts (IPSI) and the other half\
  \ used the contralateral leg for ECC2 (CONTRA). Nociceptive withdrawal reflex threshold\
  \ (NWRT) and local muscle blood oxygenation were assessed for the exercised TA muscle\
  \ before, immediately after, and one day after exercise. Results: Significant decreases\
  \ in NWRT and muscle oxygenation were observed after ECC1 (p\_<\_0.05), but NWRT\
  \ did not change after ECC2 in both groups. Smaller decreases in muscle oxygenation\
  \ were observed after ECC2 than ECC1 in both groups with a similar magnitude of\
  \ the difference between bouts, but an increase in muscle oxygen re-perfusion before\
  \ ECC2 was only observed in the IPSI group. Conclusion: These results suggest that\
  \ contralateral RBE was associated with spinal facilitation of the neuronal pathways\
  \ situated at a homologous innervation level, and it is unlikely that oxygen re-perfusion\
  \ improvement plays a major role in the contralateral RBE."
