abstract: 'Background Sedentary behavior (SB) is a biologically distinct yet understudied
  cardiovascular disease risk (CVD) factor. However, specific public health policy
  regarding the optimal strategy for SB interruption is unavailable. This paper outlines
  the protocol for part I of the Sitting with Interruption and Whole-Body Cardiovascular
  Health (SWITCH) study, including the rationale, objectives, methodology, and next
  steps. We additionally detail practical considerations that went into the development
  of the NIH R01 grant supporting this research.  Methods Healthy men and women (n
  = 56, aged 36â€“55) who are inactive (textless90 min/wk. of moderate-to-vigorous intensity
  physical activities for past 3 months) and sedentary (sitting for textgreater8 h/day),
  will be recruited for this randomized crossover trial. Specifically, participants
  will complete the following 4-h conditions: (i) SB with once/h 5 min walk break;
  (ii) SB with once/h 15 min stand break; (iii) SB with twice/h breaks (alternating
  5 min walk and 15 min stand); and (iv) SB with no breaks (i.e., control). Focus
  group discussions will refine our socioecological SB reduction model.  Results The
  primary outcome will be change in aortic arterial stiffness (i.e., pulse wave velocity;
  PWV, m/s) for each substitution strategy relative to the control (SB with no breaks)
  condition.  Conclusions The outcomes from this study will facilitate the design
  of a subsequent randomized controlled trial to test a mechanism-informed, feasible
  SB-reduction intervention and support the development of SB policy.'
