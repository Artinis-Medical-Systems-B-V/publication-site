abstract: 'Aerobic training can be effective in patients with mitochondrial myopathies
  (MM) and McArdle''s disease (McA). The aim of the study was to use noninvasive functional
  evaluation methods, specifically aimed at skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism,
  to evaluate the effects of an aerobic exercise training (cycle ergometer, 12 wk,
  4 days/wk, 65-70% of maximal heart rate) in 6 MM and 7 McA. Oxygen uptake and skeletal
  muscle vastus lateralis fractional O2 extraction by near-infrared spectroscopy were
  assessed during incremental and low-intensity constant work rate (CWR) exercises
  before (BEFORE) and at the end (AFTER) of training. Peak O2 uptake increased significantly
  with training both in MM [14.7 1.2 vs. 17.6 1.4 mlkg1min1 (mean SD)] and in McA
  (18.5 1.8 mlkg1min1 vs. 21.6 1.9). Peak skeletal muscle fractional O2 extraction
  increased with training both in MM (22.0 6.7 vs. 32.6 5.9%) and in McA (18.5 6.2
  vs. 37.2 7.2%). During low-intensity CWR in both MM and McA: V ? O2 kinetics became
  faster in AFTER, but only in the patients with slow V ? O2 kinetics in BEFORE; the
  transient overshoot in fractional O2 extraction kinetics disappeared. The level
  of habitual physical activity was not higher 3 mo after training (FOLLOW-UP vs.
  PRE). In MM and McA patients a homebased aerobic training program significantly
  attenuated the impairment of skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism and improved variables
  associated with exercise tolerance. Our findings indicate that in MM and McA patients
  near-infrared spectroscopy and V ? O2 kinetics can effectively detect the functional
  improvements obtained by training.'
