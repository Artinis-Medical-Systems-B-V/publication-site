abstract: "Introduction: Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in skeletal muscle atrophy,\
  \ increases in intramuscular fat, and reductions in skeletal muscle oxidative capacity.\
  \ Endurance training elicited with neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) may\
  \ reverse these changes and lead to improvement in muscle metabolic health. Methods:\
  \ Fourteen participants with complete SCI performed 16 weeks of home-based endurance\
  \ NMES training of knee extensor muscles. Skeletal muscle oxidative capacity, muscle\
  \ composition, and blood metabolic and lipid profiles were assessed pre- and post-training.\
  \ Results: There was an increase in number of contractions performed throughout\
  \ the duration of training. The average improvement in skeletal muscle oxidative\
  \ capacity was 119%, ranging from \u201314% to 387% (P = 0.019). There were no changes\
  \ in muscle composition or blood metabolic and lipid profiles. Conclusion: Endurance\
  \ training improved skeletal muscle oxidative capacity, but endurance NMES of knee\
  \ extensor muscles did not change blood metabolic and lipid profiles. Muscle Nerve\
