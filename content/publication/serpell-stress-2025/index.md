abstract: Purpose Psychology and social science research offer some promising work
  in the field of decision-making science. However, given the qualitative nature of
  much of this research, understanding some physiological bases of decision-making
  may assist by providing more objectivity. The purpose of this study, therefore,
  was to explore hormonal and neurophysiological biomarkers of stress relative to
  strategic decision making, with and without an accompanying exercise stress. Methods
  Twenty-one competitive male chess players were recruited to this study. On two separate
  occasions prefrontal cortex (a brain region involved in executive decision making
  which is sensitive to stress) hemodynamics were measured while participants played
  a standardized game of chess against a computer bot, once after exposure to a physical
  stressor (experimental condition) and once without (control condition). Participant’s
  stress hormones (testosterone and cortisol) were also measured in the morning of
  each test and immediately prior to the game of chess. Results Participants were
  more likely to win under experimental conditions. Interestingly, there was no difference
  between conditions for baseline testosterone and cortisol concentrations, and the
  exercise protocol did not elicit a hormonal change. However, significant differences
  were observed for prefrontal cortex hemodynamics following the physical stressor
  (vs. control condition), and changes in prefrontal cortex hemodynamics were observed
  as games progressed (p ≤ 0.034). Conclusion Our results speculatively suggest several
  independent pathways exist to explain how stress affects decision making. This work
  opens several vistas for future research exploring decision making using neurohormonal/physiological
  biomarkers.
