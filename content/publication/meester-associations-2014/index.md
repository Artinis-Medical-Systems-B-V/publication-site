abstract: "Walking, although a largely automatic process, is controlled by the cortex\
  \ and the spinal cord with corrective reflexes modulated through integration of\
  \ neural signals from central and peripheral inputs at supraspinal level throughout\
  \ the gait cycle. In this study we used an additional cognitive task to interfere\
  \ with the automatic processing during walking in order to explore the neural mechanisms\
  \ involved in healthy young adults. Participants were asked to walk on a treadmill\
  \ at two speeds, both with and without additional cognitive load. We evaluated the\
  \ impact of speed and cognitive load by analyzing activity of the prefrontal cortex\
  \ (PFC) using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) alongside spinal cord\
  \ reflex activity measured by soleus H-reflex amplitude and gait changes obtained\
  \ by using an inertial measuring unit. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed that fNIRS\
  \ Oxy-Hb concentrations signiflcantly increased in the PFC with dual task (walking\
  \ while performing a cognitive task) compared to a single task (walking only; p\
  \ < 0.05). PFC activity was unaffected by increases of walking speed. H-reflex amplitude\
  \ and gait variables did not change in response to either dual task or increases\
  \ in walking speed. When walking under additional cognitive load participants adapted\
  \ by using greater activity in the PFC, but this adaptation did not detrimentally\
  \ affect H-reflex amplitude or gait variables. Our findings suggest that in a healthy\
  \ young population central mechanisms (PFC) are activated in response to cognitive\
  \ loads but that H-reflex activity and gait performance can successfully be maintained.This\
  \ study provides insights into the mechanisms behind healthy individuals safely\
  \ performing dual task walking. \xA9 2014 Meester, Al-Yahya, Dawes, Martin-Fagg\
