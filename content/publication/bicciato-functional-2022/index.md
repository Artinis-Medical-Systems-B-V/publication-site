abstract: Objective This pilot study assesses the feasibility to detect covert consciousness
  in clinically unresponsive patients by means of functional near infrared spectroscopy
  (fNIRS) in a real intensive care unit setting. We aimed to verify if the hemodynamic
  response to familiar music measured with fNIRS varies according to the level consciousness
  of the patients.  Methods 22 neurocritical patients and 6 healthy controls were
  included. The experiment consisted in 3 subsequent blocks including a first resting
  state recording, a period of music playback and a second resting state recording.
  fNIRS measurement were performed on each subject with two optodes on the forehead.
  Main oscillatory frequencies of oxyhemoglobin signal were analyzed. Spectral changes
  of low frequency oscillations (LFO) between subsequent experimental blocks were
  used as a marker of cortical response. Cortical response was compared to the level
  of consciousness of the patients and their functional outcome, through validated
  clinical scores.  Results Cortical hemodynamic response to music on the left prefrontal
  brain was associated with the level of consciousness of the patients and with their
  clinical outcome after three months.  Conclusions Variations in LFO spectral power
  measured with fNIRS may be a new marker of cortical responsiveness to detect covert
  consciousness in neurocritical patients. Left prefrontal cortex may play an important
  role in the perception of familiar music.  Significance We showed the feasibility
  of a simple fNIRS approach to detect cortical response in the real setting of an
  intensive care unit.
