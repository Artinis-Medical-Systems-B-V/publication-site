abstract: 'Glucose ingestion and absorption into the blood stream can challenge glycemic
  regulation and vascular endothelial function. Muscular contractions in exercise
  promote a return to homeostasis by increasing glucose uptake and blood flow. Similarly,
  muscle hypoxia supports glycemic regulation by increasing glucose oxidation. Blood
  flow restriction (BFR) induces muscle hypoxia during occlusion and reactive hyperemia
  upon release. Thus, in the absence of exercise, electric muscle stimulation (EMS)
  and BFR may offer circulatory and glucoregulatory improvements. In 13 healthy, active
  participants (27±3yr, 7 female) we tracked post-glucose (oral 100g) glycemic, cardiometabolic
  and vascular function measures over 120min following four interventions: 1) BFR,
  2) EMS, 3) BFR+EMS or 4) Control. BFR was applied at 2min intervals for 30min (70%
  occlusion), EMS was continuous for 30min (maximum-tolerable intensity). Glycemic
  and insulinemic responses did not differ between interventions (partial η 2 =0.11-0.15,
  P=0.2); however, only BFR+EMS demonstrated cyclic effects on oxygen consumption,
  carbohydrate oxidation, muscle oxygenation, heart rate, and blood pressure (all
  Ptextless0.01). Endothelial function was reduced 60min post-glucose ingestion across
  interventions and recovered by 120min (5.9±2.6% vs 8.4±2.7%; Ptextless0.001). Estimated
  microvascular function was not meaningfully different. Leg blood flow increased
  during EMS and BFR+EMS (+656±519mL•min -1 , +433±510mL•min -1 ; Ptextless0.001);
  however, only remained elevated following BFR intervention 90min post-glucose (+94±94mL•min
  -1 ; P=0.02). Superimposition of EMS onto cyclic BFR did not preferentially improve
  post-glucose metabolic or vascular function amongst young, active participants.
  Cyclic BFR increased blood flow delivery 60min beyond intervention, and BFR+EMS
  selectively increased carbohydrate usage and reduced muscle oxygenation warranting
  future clinical assessments.'
