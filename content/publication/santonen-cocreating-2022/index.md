abstract: 'Background Living Labs are user-centered, open innovation ecosystems based
  on a systematic user cocreation approach, which integrates research and innovation
  processes in real-life communities and settings. The Horizon 2020 Project VITALISE
  (Virtual Health and Wellbeing Living Lab Infrastructure) unites 19 partners across
  11 countries. The project aims to harmonize Living Lab procedures and enable effective
  and convenient transnational and virtual access to key European health and well-being
  research infrastructures, which are governed by Living Labs. The VITALISE consortium
  will conduct joint research activities in the fields included in the care pathway
  of patients: rehabilitation, transitional care, and everyday living environments
  for older adults. This protocol focuses on health and well-being research in everyday
  living environments.   Objective The main aim of this study is to cocreate and test
  a harmonized research protocol for developing big data–driven hybrid persona, which
  are hypothetical user archetypes created to represent a user community. In addition,
  the use and applicability of innovative technologies will be investigated in the
  context of various everyday living and Living Lab environments.   Methods In phase
  1, surveys and structured interviews will be used to identify the most suitable
  Living Lab methods, tools, and instruments for health-related research among VITALISE
  project Living Labs (N=10). A series of web-based cocreation workshops and iterative
  cowriting processes will be applied to define the initial protocols. In phase 2,
  five small-scale case studies will be conducted to test the cocreated research protocols
  in various real-life everyday living settings and Living Lab infrastructures. In
  phase 3, a cross-case analysis grounded on semistructured interviews will be conducted
  to identify the challenges and benefits of using the proposed research protocols.
  Furthermore, a series of cocreation workshops and the consensus seeking Delphi study
  process will be conducted in parallel to cocreate and validate the acceptance of
  the defined harmonized research protocols among wider Living Lab communities.   Results
  As of September 30, 2021, project deliverables Ethics and safety manual and Living
  lab standard version 1 have been submitted to the European Commission review process.
  The study will be finished by March 2024.   Conclusions The outcome of this research
  will lead to harmonized procedures and protocols in the context of big data–driven
  hybrid persona development among health and well-being Living Labs in Europe and
  beyond. Harmonized protocols enable Living Labs to exploit similar research protocols,
  devices, hardware, and software for interventions and complex data collection purposes.
  Economies of scale and improved use of resources will speed up and improve research
  quality and offer novel possibilities for open data sharing, multidisciplinary research,
  and comparative studies beyond current practices. Case studies will also provide
  novel insights for implementing innovative technologies in the context of everyday
  Living Lab research.   International Registered Report Identifier (IRRID) DERR1-10.2196/34567'
