abstract: "The neural mechanisms underlying movement automaticity have been investigated\
  \ using PET and fMRI and more recently functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).\
  \ As fNIRS is an emerging technique, the objective of the present study was to replicate\
  \ the functional magnetic resonance imaging-related motor sequence findings as reported\
  \ by Wu et al. (J Neurophysiol 91:1690\u20131698, https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.01052.2003,\
  \ 2004) using fNIRS. Seventeen right-handed participants practiced self-initiated\
  \ sequential finger movements of two lengths (4 and 12) until a level of automaticity\
  \ was achieved. Automaticity was evaluated by performing a visual-letter-counting\
  \ task concurrently with the sequential finger movements. Our data were unable to\
  \ replicate the pre-to-post-practice decrease in cortical activity in the left dorsolateral\
  \ prefrontal cortex for both motor sequence tasks. The findings did reveal increased\
  \ contribution from the right hemisphere following learning. The observed lateralization\
  \ is suggestive of explicit learning and the involvement of working memory in motor\
  \ sequence production."
