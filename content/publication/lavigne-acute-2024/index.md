abstract: We investigated the influence of short‐ and long‐interval cycling exercise
  with blood flow restriction (BFR) on neuromuscular fatigue, shear stress and muscle
  oxygenation, potent stimuli to BFR‐training adaptations. During separate sessions,
  eight individuals performed short‐ (24 × 60 s/30 s; SI) or long‐interval (12 × 120 s/60 s;
  LI) trials on a cycle ergometer, matched for total work. One leg exercised with
  (BFR‐leg) and the other without (CTRL‐leg) BFR. Quadriceps fatigue was quantified
  using pre‐ to post‐interval changes in maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), potentiated
  twitch force (QT) and voluntary activation (VA). Shear rate was measured by Doppler
  ultrasound at cuff release post‐intervals. Vastus lateralis tissue oxygenation was
  measured by near‐infrared spectroscopy during exercise. Following the initial interval,
  significant (P textless 0.05) declines in MVC and QT were found in both SI and LI,
  which were more pronounced in the BFR‐leg, and accounted for approximately two‐thirds
  of the total reduction at exercise termination. In the BFR‐leg, reductions in MVC
  (–28 ± 15%), QT (–42 ± 17%), and VA (–15 ± 17%) were maximal at exercise termination
  and persisted up to 8 min post‐exercise. Exercise‐induced muscle deoxygenation was
  greater (P textless 0.001) in the BFR‐leg than CTRL‐leg and perceived pain was more
  in LI than SI (P textless 0.014). Cuff release triggered a significant (P textless 0.001)
  shear rate increase which was consistent across trials. Exercise‐induced neuromuscular
  fatigue in the BFR‐leg exceeded that in the CTRL‐leg and was predominantly of peripheral
  origin. BFR also resulted in diminished muscle oxygenation and elevated shear stress.
  Finally, short‐interval trials resulted in comparable neuromuscular and haemodynamic
  responses with reduced perceived pain compared to long‐intervals.
