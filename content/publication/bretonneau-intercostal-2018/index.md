abstract: "Aims: Objectives During acute bronchial obstruction, the work of breathing\
  \ increases, while a reduction in perfusion of respiratory muscles due to hyperinflation\
  \ and/or mechanical constraints may impair the contraction. To test this hypothesis,\
  \ tissue oxygenation of intercostal muscles was assessed by NIRS in healthy subjects\
  \ breathing freely or against an expiratory load (EL).Methods: 11 active men (23\
  \ \xB1 2 years) were included in the study. Subjects breathed freely for 5 min in\
  \ unloaded condition (Ctrl) then for 20 min through a positive EL of 20 cmH2O (Threshold\
  \ PEP, Respironics). Tissue saturation index (TSI) of intercostal muscle and the\
  \ changes in concentration of oxy, deoxy and total haemoglobin [O2Hb], [HHb] and\
  \ [tHb] were measured in the 7th intercostal space by NIRS (Oxymon Mk III, Artinis).\
  \ Ventilation (VE), O2 uptake and CO2 production (VCO2), (Metamax, Cortex), dyspnea\
  \ (Borg scale) and pulmonary volumes and capacities (Hyp'Air, Medisoft) were also\
  \ measured.Results: Tidal volume and VE increased during EL (ptextless0.001) while\
  \ breathing frequency was decreased (ptextless0.05). Ti, Ttot, Ti/Ttot and Vt/Te\
  \ were greater with EL and dyspnea occurred. [tHb] and [O2Hb] were decreased as\
  \ compared to Ctrl (-5.16 \xB5mol and -3.54 \xB5mol, ptextless0.05), [HHb] did not\
  \ change. TSI was 68 \xB1 8 % during Ctrl and did not change with EL. RER increased\
  \ as well as VE/VCO2 (+14.6, ptextless0.001); conversely PetCO2 significantly decreased.Conclusions:\
  \ Tissue saturation index and [O2Hb] were not significantly altered by EL, whereas\
  \ [tHb] was reduced. Despite this reduction in Hb muscle concentration, the oxygen\
  \ availability in the intercostal muscles did not seem to be reduced during an acute\
  \ airway obstruction suggesting an adaptation of blood flow to EL.FootnotesCite\
