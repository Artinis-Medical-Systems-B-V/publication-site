abstract: 'Background Following a stroke, brain activation reorganisation, movement
  compensatory strategies, motor performance and their evolution through rehabilitation
  are matters of importance for clinicians. Two non-invasive neuroimaging methods
  allow for recording task-related brain activation: functional near-infrared spectroscopy
  (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (fEEG), respectively based on hemodynamic response
  and neuronal electrical activity. Their simultaneous measurement during movements
  could allow a better spatiotemporal mapping of brain activation, and when associated
  to kinematic parameters could unveil underlying mechanisms of functional upper limb
  (UL) recovery. This study aims to depict the motor cortical activity patterns using
  combined fNIRS-fEEG and their relationship to motor performance and strategies during
  UL functional tasks in chronic post-stroke patients. Methods Twenty-one healthy
  old adults and 21 chronic post-stroke patients were recruited and completed two
  standardised functional tasks of the UL: a paced-reaching task where they had to
  reach a target in front of them and a circular steering task where they had to displace
  a target using a hand-held stylus, as fast as possible inside a circular track projected
  on a computer screen. The activity of the bilateral motor cortices and motor performance
  were recorded simultaneously utilizing a fNIRS-fEEG and kinematics platform. Results
  and conclusions Kinematic analysis revealed that post-stroke patients performed
  worse in the circular steering task and used more trunk compensation in both tasks.
  Brain analysis of bilateral motor cortices revealed that stroke individuals over-activated
  during the paretic UL reaching task, which was associated with more trunk usage
  and a higher level of impairment (clinical scores). This work opens up avenues for
  using such combined methods to better track and understand brain-movement evolution
  through stroke rehabilitation.'
