abstract: "Background: Myofascial Reorganization (MFR) is a physiotherapy technique\
  \ that mixes myofascial pressures and slips and has been used as a simple and non-invasive\
  \ method that readjusts soft tissues, as well as myofascial adhesions and contractures\
  \ that may cause decreased blood supply and consequently of physical activity. Objective:\
  \ To verify if the MFR alters the tissue oxygenation of the trapezius muscle (TM)\
  \ in subjects without the pain symptom in the evaluation day. Methods: The sample\
  \ consisted of eight subjects with a mean age of 23 (\xB1 6) years and a body mass\
  \ index of 23.2 (\xB115.0) kg.m-2. Changes in muscle oxygenation were measured by\
  \ near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) (Portamon, Artinis, the Netherlands) in TM before\
  \ and after 15 minutes of intervention. The proposed MFR protocol lasted approximately\
  \ 10 minutes and consisted of pressures, stretching and myofascial slippage of the\
  \ upper, middle and lower TM fibers. Data normality was performed using the Shapiro\
  \ Wilk test and due to the parametric nature of the data, the paired t-test was\
  \ used for pre and post intervention comparison. Results: There was a significant\
  \ increase in the tissue saturation index (TSI) in the trapezius muscle (80.7\xB1\
  2.7% vs. 89.4\xB14.6%; p= 0.002) in the pre and post intervention comparison. The\
  \ pre-post variation delta of oxyhemoglobin - O2 Hb (8.1\xB111.2 g/dL), deoxyhemoglobin\
  \ - HHb (-0.72\xB11.6 g/dL) and total hemoglobin - tHB (7.4\xB112.3 g/dL) showed\
  \ no significant difference. However, there was an increase in O2 Hb, tHB levels\
  \ and a decrease in HHb. Conclusion: The findings showed that the MFR applied on\
  \ trapezius muscle increased the TSI, which reflects on peripheral muscle oxygenation\
  \ in subjects without pain in the day of evaluation."
