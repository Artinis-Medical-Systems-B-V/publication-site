abstract: 'Background: While the number of people with hypertension (HBP) continues
  to increase, the therapeutic target for optimal blood pressure (BP) has been revised
  to a lower level. Studies have suggested that High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)
  could be as efficient as BP-lowering drugs, but no study has compared their efficacy
  in a randomized trial. The aim of this protocol is to determine if HIIT is as efficient
  as Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in lowering 24 h ambulatory BP in prehypertensive
  older adults. Moreover, the secondary aim is to determine if HIIT is associated
  with greater cardiovascular and cognitive benefits than HCTZ. Methods: This study
  is an interventional, single-center, non-inferiority trial, with two randomized
  parallel groups of prehypertensive participants aged 60 years or more. One group
  will be prescribed daily doses of 12.5 mg of HCTZ for 12 weeks, and the other group
  will follow thrice-weekly HIIT for 12 weeks. Each group will be composed of 30 participants.
  The primary outcome is 24 h ambulatory BP. Secondary outcomes are scores on neuropsychological
  assessments, balance and gait performances, maximal oxygen uptake, peripheral endothelial
  function, and arterial stiffness. Non-inferiority tests will be performed on the
  primary outcome, and secondary outcomes will be compared using independent t-tests.
  Conclusion: This study will determine if HIIT is at least as efficient as HCTZ in
  lowering BP in prehypertensive older adults. This study will also determine if HIIT
  provides greater benefits in terms of cardiovascular and cognitive status (NCT04103411).'
