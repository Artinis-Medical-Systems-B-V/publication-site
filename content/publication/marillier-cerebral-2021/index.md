abstract: Deterioration and subsequent improvement in cerebral oxygenation during
  acute and prolonged hypoxic exposure may affect whole-body exercise performance
  at high altitude. In this study, we investigated the effect of hypoxic exposure
  on cerebral haemodynamics at different cortical locations during exercise at the
  same relative intensity after 1 (D1) and 5 days (D5) at 4350 m. Eleven male subjects
  performed a submaximal bout of cycling exercise (6 min at 35% + 6 min at 55% + time-to-exhaustion
  at 75% of peak work rate achieved in the same conditions, i.e. normoxia or hypoxia
  at sea level) on D1 and D5. Transcranial Doppler and near-infrared spectroscopy
  were used to assess middle cerebral artery blood velocity and prefrontal and motor
  cortex oxygenation, respectively. Despite using the same relative intensity, the
  duration of exercise was reduced on D1 (22.7 ± 5.1 min) compared with sea level
  (32.2 ± 9.0 min; P textless 0.001), with no improvement on D5 (20.9 ± 6.3 min; P
  textgreater 0.05). Middle cerebral artery blood velocity during exercise was elevated
  on D1 (+18.2%) and D5 (+15.0%) compared with sea level (P textless 0.001). However,
  prefrontal and motor cortex oxygenation was reduced on D1 and D5 compared with sea
  level (P textless 0.001). This pattern was of similar magnitude between cortical
  locations, whereas the total haemoglobin concentration increased to a greater extent
  in the prefrontal versus motor cortex at exhaustion on D1 and D5. In contrast to
  our primary hypothesis, prefrontal and motor cortex oxygenation and exercise performance
  did not improve over 5 days at 4350 m. The sustained impairment in cerebral oxygenation
  might contribute to the absence of improvement in exercise performance after partial
  acclimatization to high altitude.
