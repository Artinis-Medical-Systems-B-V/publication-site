abstract: "Objectives: in vitro assessment of the reproducibility and the optimal\
  \ separation and position of the optodes in continuous wave (CW-) NIRS measurement\
  \ of local inhomogeneities in absorption and/or scattering. Methods: a CW- NIRS\
  \ system (OXYMON) was used with laser diodes at wavelengths of 767 nm, 845 nm, 905\
  \ nm, 945 nm and 975 nm. For practical considerations (dimensions of neonatal head)\
  \ the measurements were perforated on a cylindrical tissue-equivalent phantom (70\
  \ mm diameter of base material with $\u03BC$a = 0.01 mm-1 (800 nm) and $\u03BC$\u2032\
  s = 1.00 mm-1 (800 nm)), containing rods with 10 \xD7 absorption, or 10 \xD7 scattering,\
  \ and 5 \xD7 both Monte Carlo simulations were carried out of a cylinder with transport\
  \ scattering coefficient $\u03BC$\u2032s = 0.525 mm-1 and absorption coefficient\
  \ $\u03BC$a = 0.075 mm-1 and two optode positions. Results: reproducibility of repeated\
  \ measurements (n = 10) was \xB1 0.005 OD. Maximum OD in case of absorbing rod,\
  \ and of absorbing + scattering rod was measured with optodes separated by 90\xB0\
  \ and rod position angle symmetrically (45\xB0) in between. Minimum OD for these\
  \ rods was obtained with optodes at 150\xB0 angle and rod position at 2400 (i.e.\
  \ relative to transmitting optode position at 0\xB0). A second maximum OD was obtained\
  \ at an optode angle 180\xB0 and rod position at 180\xB0. Maximum OD (i.e. attenuation)\
  \ for the scattering rod was at optode separation angle of 90\xB0 and rod at 0\xB0\
  . Minimum OD for this case was obtained with optode angle of 180o and rod positions\
  \ around 80\xB0 and 280\xB0. Maximum OD changes by absorbing rod were in the order\
  \ of +0.12 OD and -0.04 OD, respectively. Simulations at an optode separation angle\
  \ of 90\xB0 showed a spatial sensitivity path enclosing the rod position at maximum\
  \ absorption found experimentally. Conclusions: when considering the phantom as\
  \ a realistic geometrical model for the neonatal head, it can be concluded that\
  \ the optode position at 90\xB0 angle would be optimal for detecting an inhomogeneity\
  \ at 15 mm depth, i.e. the location of the periventricular white matter. Since the\
  \ rods are relatively strongly different from the base material the question remains\
  \ to be answered whether local ischemia, which might lead to irreversible brain\
  \ damage, can be detected by CW-NIRS."
