abstract: "The present study aimed to examine the effects of chronological age and\
  \ cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) on cognitive performance and prefrontal cortex\
  \ activity, and to test the compensation-related utilization of neural circuits\
  \ hypothesis (CRUNCH). A total of 19 young adults (18\u201322 years) and 37 older\
  \ ones (60\u201377 years) with a high or low CRF level were recruited to perform\
  \ a working memory updating task under three different cognitive load conditions.\
  \ Prefrontal cortex hemodynamic responses were continuously recorded using functional\
  \ near-infrared spectroscopy, and behavioral performances and perceived difficulty\
  \ were measured. Results showed that chronological age had deleterious effects on\
  \ both cognitive performance and prefrontal cortex activation under a higher cognitive\
  \ load. In older adults, however, higher levels of CRF were related to increased\
  \ bilateral prefrontal cortex activation patterns that allowed them to sustain better\
  \ cognitive performances, especially under the highest cognitive load. These results\
  \ are discussed in the light of the neurocognitive CRUNCH model."
