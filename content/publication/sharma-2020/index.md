abstract: "Aim: This study investigated cerebral hemodynamic responses to a neurovascular\
  \ coupling (NVC) test in retired contact athletes with a history of repeated mild\
  \ traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and in controls with no history of mTBI. Methods:\
  \ Twenty-one retired rugby players (47.7 \xB1 12.9 year old; age at retirement:\
  \ 38.5 \xB1 8.9 year; number of years playing rugby: 12.7 \xB1 3.7 year) with a\
  \ history of three or more diagnosed concussions (8.9 \xB1 7.9 concussions per player)\
  \ and 23 controls with no history of mTBI (46.5 \xB1 12.8 year old) performed a\
  \ NVC test to detect task-orientated cerebral hemodynamic changes using functional\
  \ near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Results: The NVC showed a statistically significant\
  \ reduction in the cerebral hemodynamic response in comparison to the control group\
  \ which had a greater relative increase of oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb). There were reductions\
  \ in left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) O2Hb (\u22120.015 \xB1 0.258 $\u03BC$M) and\
  \ relative increases in deoxyhemoglobin (HHb; \u22120.004 \xB1 0.159 $\u03BC$M)\
  \ in the same region for the mTBI group in comparison to the control group (\u2212\
  0.160 \xB1 0.311 $\u03BC$M; \u22120.121 \xB1 0.076 $\u03BC$M for O2Hb and HHb, respectively).\
  \ The mTBI group induced a greater rate of oxygen extraction compared to the control\
  \ group. Conclusion: This was the first study to examine cerebral hemodynamic changes\
  \ in retired rugby players in response to a NVC test, and we found reduced cerebral\
  \ hemodynamic responses in participants with a history of mTBI compared to controls.\
  \ These results suggest altered cerebral metabolic demands in participants with\
  \ a history of multiple head injuries. Further research is needed to ascertain an\
  \ understanding of the changes in hemodynamics from playing into retirement."
