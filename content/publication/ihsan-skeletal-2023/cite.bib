Repeated heat treatment has been shown to induce oxidative adaptations in cell cultures and rodents, but similar work within human models is scarce. This study investigated the effects of 6 weeks of localized heat therapy on near-infrared spectroscopy-(NIRS) derived indices of muscle oxidative and microvascular function. Twelve physically active participants (8 males and 4 females, age: 34.9 ± 5.9 years, stature: 175 ± 7 cm, body mass: 76.7 ± 13.3 kg) undertook a 6-week intervention, where adhesive heat pads were applied for 8 h/day, 5 days/week, on one calf of each participant, while the contralateral leg acted as control. Prior to and following the intervention, the microvascular function was assessed using NIRS-based methods, where 5 min of popliteal artery occlusion was applied, and the reperfusion (i.e., re-saturation rate, re-saturation amplitude, and hyperemic response) was monitored for 2 min upon release. Participants also performed a 1-min isometric contraction of the plantar flexors (30% maximal voluntary contraction), following which a further 2 min interval was undertaken for the assessment of recovery kinetics. A 20-min time interval was allowed before the assessment protocol was repeated on the contralateral leg. Repeated localized heating of the gastrocnemius did not influence any of the NIRS-derive indices of microvascular or oxidative function (
