abstract: 'Abstract  Repeated heat treatment has been shown to induce oxidative adaptations
  in cell cultures and rodents, but similar work within human models is scarce. This
  study investigated the effects of 6 weeks of localized heat therapy on near-infrared
  spectroscopy-(NIRS) derived indices of muscle oxidative and microvascular function.
  Twelve physically active participants (8 males and 4 females, age: 34.9 ± 5.9 years,
  stature: 175 ± 7 cm, body mass: 76.7 ± 13.3 kg) undertook a 6-week intervention,
  where adhesive heat pads were applied for 8 h/day, 5 days/week, on one calf of each
  participant, while the contralateral leg acted as control. Prior to and following
  the intervention, the microvascular function was assessed using NIRS-based methods,
  where 5 min of popliteal artery occlusion was applied, and the reperfusion (i.e.,
  re-saturation rate, re-saturation amplitude, and hyperemic response) was monitored
  for 2 min upon release. Participants also performed a 1-min isometric contraction
  of the plantar flexors (30% maximal voluntary contraction), following which a further
  2 min interval was undertaken for the assessment of recovery kinetics. A 20-min
  time interval was allowed before the assessment protocol was repeated on the contralateral
  leg. Repeated localized heating of the gastrocnemius did not influence any of the
  NIRS-derive indices of microvascular or oxidative function ( p textgreater 0.05)
  following 6 weeks of treatment. Our findings indicate that localized heating via
  the use of adhesive heat pads may not be a potent stimulus for muscle adaptations
  in physically active humans.'
