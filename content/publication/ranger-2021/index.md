abstract: "Introduction: We developed a novel device, Calmer, that mimics key components\
  \ of skin-to-skin holding to reduce stress in preterm infants. Our feasibility trial\
  \ showed that Calmer worked 50% better than no treatment and no differently from\
  \ our standard of care, facilitated tucking (FT), for reducing pain scores during\
  \ a heel lance in preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit. Objective:\
  \ We compared the effects of Calmer on regional cerebral hemodynamic activity during\
  \ a noxious stimulation to FT. Methods: During a clinically required heel lance,\
  \ we measured frontal cortex tissue oxygenation in a subsample of 29 preterm infants\
  \ (27\u201333 weeks gestational age) from our larger randomized controlled trial.\
  \ Infants were randomized to either FT (n 5 16) or Calmer treatment (n 5 12). The\
  \ outcome measure, obtained using near-infrared spectroscopy, was a change in the\
  \ tissue oxygenation index (TSI) across study phases (Baseline, Heel Lance, Recovery;\
  \ median duration 517 seconds [421\u2013906 seconds]). Results: No statistically\
  \ significant differences were found between groups in the median TSI during any\
  \ of the study phases. In response to the heel lance, 7 infants (27.6%) had a TSI\
  \ that dipped below the 60% threshold (3 in the Calmer group 25% and 4 in the FT\
  \ group 25%); none below 50%. Conclusions: Infants on Calmer maintained normal regional\
  \ cerebral oxygen levels (55%\u201385%) no differently from infants receiving a\
  \ human touch intervention during blood collection. Parental skin-to-skin holding\
  \ is one of the most effective strategies to relieve procedural pain in preterm\
  \ infants. When parents or FT are not available, Calmer shows potential for filling\
  \ this gap in care."
