abstract: "Reductions in prefrontal oxygenation near maximal exertion may limit exercise\
  \ performance by impairing executive functions that influence the decision to stop\
  \ exercising; however, whether deoxygenation also occurs in motor regions that more\
  \ directly affect central motor drive is unknown. Multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy\
  \ was used to compare changes in prefrontal, premotor, and motor cortices during\
  \ exhaustive exercise. Twenty-three subjects performed two sequential, incremental\
  \ cycle tests (25 W/min ramp) during acute hypoxia [79 Torr inspired PO2 (PIO2)]\
  \ and normoxia (117 Torr PI O2) in an environmental chamber. Test order was balanced,\
  \ and subjects were blinded to chamber pressure. In normoxia, bilateral prefrontal\
  \ oxygenation was maintained during low- and moderate-intensity exercise but dropped\
  \ 9.0 \xB1 10.7% (mean \xB1 SD, P < 0.05) before exhaustion (maximal power = 305\
  \ \xB1 52 W). The pattern and magnitude of deoxygenation were similar in prefrontal,\
  \ premotor, and motor regions (R2 > 0.94). In hypoxia, prefrontal oxygenation was\
  \ reduced 11.1 \xB1 14.3% at rest (P < 0.01) and fell another 26.5 \xB1 19.5% (P\
  \ < 0.01) at exhaustion (maximal power = 256 \xB1 38 W, P < 0.01). Correlations\
  \ between regions were high (R2 > 0.61), but deoxygenation was greater in prefrontal\
  \ than premotor and motor regions (P < 0.05). Prefrontal, premotor, and motor cortex\
  \ deoxygenation during high-intensity exercise may contribute to an integrative\
  \ decision to stop exercise. The accelerated rate of cortical deoxygenation in hypoxia\
  \ may hasten this effect. Copyright \xA9 2009 the American Physiological Society."
