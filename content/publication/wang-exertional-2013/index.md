abstract: "Background: Exertional periodic breathing (EPB) or anemia is associated\
  \ with an adverse prognosis in advanced heart failure (HF). The disturbed rheological\
  \ properties of erythrocytes may contribute to circulatory disorders. This study\
  \ investigated whether EPB with/without anemia influences rheological/hemodynamic\
  \ functions in patients with HF. Methods: According to the WHO criteria for anemia,\
  \ 168 HF patients were divided into six groups: non (N)-anemic with (n = 27)/without\
  \ (n = 56) EPB, light (L)-anemic with (n = 17)/without (n = 21) EPB, and moderate/several\
  \ (M/S)-anemic with (n = 21)/without (n = 26) EPB groups. These HF patients and\
  \ 30 healthy counterparts performed an incremental exercise test using a bicycle\
  \ ergometer. Rheological and hemodynamic characteristics were determined by slit-flow\
  \ ektacytometer and bioreactance-based device/near infrared spectrometer, respectively.\
  \ Results: In the HF patients with EPB, both L- and M/S-anemic groups exhibited\
  \ 1) higher plasma myeloperoxidase/interleukin-6 concentrations, 2) more blood senescent/spherical\
  \ erythrocyte counts, 3) larger aggregability and smaller deformability of erythrocytes\
  \ under shear flows, 4) higher systemic vascular resistance, which was accompanied\
  \ by smaller amounts of blood distributed to cerebral/muscular tissues during exercise,\
  \ 5) less VO2peak and ventilatory efficiency, and 6) lower Short Form-36 physical/mental\
  \ component scores and higher Minnesota Living with HF questionnaire score than\
  \ N-anemic group. Additionally, plasma myeloperoxidase/interleukin-6 levels were\
  \ directly related to erythrocyte aggregability and inversely related to erythrocyte\
  \ deformability. However, there were no significant differences in pro-inflammatory\
  \ factors, rheological/hemodynamic properties, and aerobic capacity between L- and\
  \ N-anemic groups in the HF patients without EPB. Conclusion: EPB potentiates anemia-related\
  \ rheological/hemodynamic dysfunctions by elevating pro-inflammatory status, reducing\
  \ physical fitness in patients with HF. \xA9 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."
