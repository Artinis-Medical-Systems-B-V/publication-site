abstract: 'Objective: Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) is a progressive cardiovascular
  condition affecting 8-10 million adults in the United States. PAD elevates the risk
  of cardiovascular events, but up to 50% of people with PAD are asymptomatic and
  undiagnosed. In this study, we tested the ability of a device, REFLO (Rapid Electromagnetic
  FLOw), to identify low blood flow using electromagnetic radiation and dynamic thermography
  toward a non-invasive PAD diagnostic.Approach.During REFLO radio frequency (RF)
  irradiation, the rate of temperature increase is a function of the rate of energy
  absorption and blood flow to the irradiated tissue. For a given rate of RF energy
  absorption, a slow rate of temperature increase implies a large blood flow rate
  to the tissue. This is due to the cooling effect of the blood. Post-irradiation,
  a slow rate of temperature decrease is associated with a low rate of blood flow
  to the tissue. Here, we performed two cohorts of controlled flow experiments on
  human calves during baseline, occluded, and post-occluded conditions. Nonlinear
  regression was used to fit temperature data and obtain the rate constant, which
  was used as a metric for blood flow.Main results.In the pilot study, (N= 7) REFLO
  distinguished between baseline and post-occlusion during the irradiation phase,
  and between baseline and occlusion in the post-irradiation phase. In the reliability
  study, (N= 5 with 3 visits each), two-way ANOVA revealed that flow and subject significantly
  affected skin heating and cooling rates, while visit did not.Significance.Results
  suggest that MMW irradiation can be used to distinguish between blood flow rates
  in humans. Utilizing the rate of skin cooling rather than heating is more consistent
  for distinguishing flow. Future modifications and clinical testing will aim to improve
  REFLO''s ability to distinguish between flow rates and evaluate its ability to accurately
  identify PAD.'
