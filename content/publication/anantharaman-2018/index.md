abstract: "Binary metal oxides of CeO2-Sm2O3 (CSx, x varies from 10 to 90 mol%) along\
  \ with pure CeO2 and Sm2O3 were synthesised successfully by the EDTA-Citrate method.\
  \ From XRD, Raman spectroscopy and UV\u2013vis DRS results, the whole composition\
  \ of metal oxides exist in three phases: (fluorite phase (F) (CS10-CS30), bi-phase\
  \ (fluorite (F) + cubic (C)) (CS30-CS90) and cubic phase (C) (Sm2O3)). For CSx samples,\
  \ the calculated band gap energy values obtained from the UV\u2013vis DRS results\
  \ were in between 3.0\u20135.1 eV and fluorite phase samples (CS10\u2013CS30) displayed\
  \ lower band gap energy values (3.04\u20133.07 eV) than compared to the samples\
  \ in other phases. Similarly, from XPS analysis, fluorite phase samples (CS10\u2013\
  CS30) showed higher surface oxygen vacancy concentration than compared to samples\
  \ in other phases. Catalytic activity for soot oxidation is carried out on CSx samples,\
  \ and the T50 temperature is in between 480\u2013540 \xB0C. Fluorite phase samples\
  \ (CS10 CS30) showed higher surface area, lower degree of agglomeration, lower band\
  \ gap energy, higher oxygen vacancy concentration and better catalytic activity\
  \ for soot oxidation. Among all the CSx samples, CS10 sample displayed highest surface\
  \ area (38 m2/g), lowest degree of agglomeration (0.36), lowest band gap energy\
  \ (3.04 eV), highest oxygen vacancy concentration (64%) and highest soot oxidation\
  \ activity (T50 = 480 \xB0C). The order of the soot oxidation activity of CSx samples\
  \ followed the same trend of band gap energy values."
