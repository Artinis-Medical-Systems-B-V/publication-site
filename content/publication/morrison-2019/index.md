abstract: "This study determined if a single bout of repeated-sprint running under\
  \ hypoxic (RSH) conditions was associated with impaired cognitive function when\
  \ compared with repeated-sprint running under normoxic (RSN) conditions. Eleven\
  \ amateur team-sport athletes performed a repeated-sprint running protocol (4 sets\
  \ of 4, 4-s all-out sprints; i.e., RSR444) under both conditions (14.5% and 20.9%\
  \ O2) on a non-motorized treadmill. Changes in SpO2, prefrontal cortex total haemoglobin\
  \ ($\u0394$[THb]), oxyhaemoglobin ($\u0394$[O2Hb]), deoxyhaemoglobin ($\u0394$[HHb])\
  \ and cognitive function (detection task: DET; identification task: IDN; one card\
  \ learning task: OCL; performed pre and 20 min post RSR444) were examined. During\
  \ RSH, SpO2 was lower following each set (p \u2264 0.05), while [HHb] was higher\
  \ after each set (p \u2264 0.05) compared with RSN. In addition, while there was\
  \ no effect of condition on DET (p = 0.20) or IDN (p = 0.14), OCL accuracy was lower\
  \ after, compared with before, RSH (p=0.04), but not RSN (p = 0.52). A significant\
  \ relationship was observed between \u2206[HHB] and \u2206OCL accuracy (r =-0.68,\
  \ p = 0.01). Performance of a single bout of RSH with 14.5% O2 resulted in impaired\
  \ cognitive function in amateur team-sport athletes. Coaches should be mindful of\
  \ timing of RSH prescription with regard to other training sessions that challenge\
  \ speed and movement accuracy."
