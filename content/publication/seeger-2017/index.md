abstract: "Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) may enhance exercise performance. Cardioprotective\
  \ effects of IPC are known to re-occur 24\_h after the stimulus. Whether the delayed\
  \ effect of IPC has similar effects as IPC on exercise performance is unknown. Objectives\
  \ Examine whether IPC applied 24\_h (24-IPC) before exercise is equally effective\
  \ as IPC in improving exercise performance. Design Randomized, cross-over study\
  \ Methods 12 healthy participants were randomly exposed to SHAM-session, IPC or\
  \ 24-IPC before a self-paced 5\_km running trial on a treadmill. Subjects were blinded\
  \ for time, speed and heart rate. Furthermore, heart rate, BORG, and the local tissue\
  \ saturation index were measured during exercise, while lactate levels were determined\
  \ after running. Using a regression model, we explored whether these parameters\
  \ predicted the change in running time after IPC and 24-IPC. Results We found no\
  \ differences in finish time after IPC (SHAM: 1400\_\xB1\_105\_s, IPC: 1381\_\xB1\
  \_112\_s, 24-IPC: 1385\_\xB1\_113\_s; p\_=\_0.30). However, we observed a significant\
  \ positive relation between the change in finish time after IPC and 24-IPC (p\_\
  =\_0.016; r\_=\_0.677). Using stepwise linear regression, a lower post-exercise\
  \ blood lactate level after IPC or 24-IPC was significantly related to an improvement\
  \ in finish time (R2\_=\_0.47, $\u03B2$\_=\_-0.687, p\_=\_0.007). Conclusions Although\
  \ no significant effect of IPC or 24-IPC on exercise performance was found, individual\
  \ finish time after IPC and 24-IPC were strongly correlated. Therefore, our data\
  \ suggest that, at the individual level, the effects of 24-IPC are closely related\
  \ to the effects of IPC."
