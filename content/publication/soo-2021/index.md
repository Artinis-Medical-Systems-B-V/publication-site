abstract: "This study examined the effect of graded hypoxia during exhaustive intermittent\
  \ cycling on subsequent exercise performance and neuromuscular fatigue characteristics\
  \ in normoxia. Fifteen well-trained cyclists performed an exhaustive intermittent\
  \ cycling exercise (EICE 1; 15 s at 30% of anaerobic power reserve interspersed\
  \ with 45 s of passive recovery) at sea level (SL; FiO2 $\u223C$ 0.21), moderate\
  \ (MH; FiO2 $\u223C$ 0.16) and severe hypoxia (SH; FiO2 $\u223C$ 0.12). This was\
  \ followed, after 30 min of passive recovery in normoxia, by an identical exercise\
  \ bout in normoxia (EICE 2). Neuromuscular function of the knee extensors was assessed\
  \ at baseline, after EICE 1 (post-EICE 1), and EICE 2 (post-EICE 2). The number\
  \ of efforts completed decreased with increasing hypoxic severity during EICE 1\
  \ (SL: 39 \xB1 30, MH: 22 \xB1 13, SH: 13 \xB1 6; p \u2264 0.02), whereas there\
  \ was no difference between conditions during EICE 2 (SL: 16 \xB1 9, MH: 20 \xB1\
  \ 14, SH: 24 \xB1 17; p \u2265 0.09). Maximal torque (p = 0.007), peripheral (p\
  \ = 0.02) and cortical voluntary activation (p < 0.001), and twitch torque (p <\
  \ 0.001) decreased from baseline to post-EICE 1. Overall, there were no significant\
  \ difference in any neuromuscular parameters from post-EICE 1 to post-EICE 2 (p\
  \ \u2265 0.08). Increasing hypoxia severity during exhaustive intermittent cycling\
  \ hampered exercise capacity, but did not influence performance and associated neuromuscular\
  \ responses during a subsequent bout of exercise in normoxia performed after 30\
  \ min of rest."
