abstract: "In most team sports, intermittent high intensity sprint efforts combined\
  \ with short recovery periods have been identified as a key factor of physical performance;\
  \ the ability to repeat these efforts at a sustained level is of great importance.\
  \ Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been proposed as a tool to monitor muscle\
  \ oxygenation changes during such sprint efforts. The purpose of this study was\
  \ to observe muscle reoxygenation rate (reoxy rate) (% s-1) between sprint efforts\
  \ in a repeat sprint cycle test. A two wavelength spatially resolved NIR spectrometer\
  \ (Portamon, Artinis Inc.) was used to assess reoxy rate changes in the vastus lateralis\
  \ of the dominant leg before and after a training stimulus. Eight UK premiership\
  \ academy level rugby players were assessed (age 20.6 \xB1 0.9) years; height 187\
  \ \xB1 0.6 cm; weight 109.5 \xB1 8.6 kg; quadriceps skin fold 16.6 \xB1 4.5 mm);\
  \ the subjects completed ten repeated 10-s cycle sprints interspersed with 40 s\
  \ recovery, upon a Wattbike Pro cycle. Hemoglobin variables ($\u0394$HHb, $\u0394\
  $tHb, $\u0394$O2Hb, $\u0394$TSI %) during the sprint and the post-sprint reoxygenation\
  \ rate (%TSI s\u02C91) were measured. During both cycle tests all subjects experienced\
  \ a drop in muscle oxygen saturation (Pre-$\u0394$ \u2212 12.39 \xB1 6.01%), Post-$\u0394\
  $ \u2212 14.83 \xB1 3.88%). Post-training, there was an increase in the extent of\
  \ desaturation (drop in TSI %) in the group means, both for the biggest single change\
  \ and the average of all ten changes. Seven out of eight players showed an increase\
  \ based on the maximum change and six based on the average of their ten tests. Additionally,\
  \ seven out of eight players showed a significant increase in $\u0394$HHb (Pre-$\u0394\
  $ + 76.80 \xB1 61.92, Post-$\u0394$ + 121.28 \xB1 69.76) (p < 0.01) (including the\
  \ one player who did not show a significant effect on the TSI measure). Players\
  \ who exercised at the highest power tended to decrease their muscle oxygenation\
  \ to a greater extent. The number of bike training sessions undertaken correlated\
  \ with improvements in post-exercise recovery of oxygenation (R = 0.63). The simplest\
  \ explanation for the increase in desaturation following training is an increase\
  \ in muscle oxygen consumption due to an increase in mitochondrial content. This\
  \ results in an increased extraction of delivered oxygen as confirmed by the HHb\
  \ data. In conclusion, NIRS is able to measure positive training effects on muscle\
  \ oxygen extraction, at the level of the individual elite athlete."
