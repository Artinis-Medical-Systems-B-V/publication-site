abstract: 'Motion is disruptive to neuroimaging methods. Motion artefacts range from
  large amplitude and short frequency spikes to drifts in amplitude causing cofounds
  in the analysis or completely invalidating any analysis, leading to epoch exclusion
  of data. However, we can only acquire ecologically robust information if subjects
  are engaging in natural interaction with their environment. Even more so in the
  case of sports, infants or motor disorder afflicted populations, where movement
  will happen. We proposed to study the relationship between channel location and
  Inertial Measuring Unit (IMU) quantified head movements, in order to better understand
  their effects in fNIRS data. Cerebral oxygenated (O2Hb) and deoxygenated (HHb) haemoglobin
  were measured bilaterally in prefrontal to frontal and occipital to temporo-parietal
  regions of healthy individuals. All participants performed controlled head movements
  in four conditions: Up, Down, measured by pitch IMU values; and Left, Right, measured
  by yaw IMU values, in varying degrees of movement. We analysed amplitude and coefficient
  of determination of O2Hb and HHb, within conditions and channel coordinates across
  subjects. Our results show that smaller angle magnitude movements (bellow 60 degrees
  in rotation) are significantly different than larger angle magnitude movements (above
  75 degrees in rotation) with a p value of 0.0073; and that the Up condition is significantly
  different than other movement directions with a p value of 0.0001. We conclude that
  movement artefacts do not depend on area of measurement for the movement conditions
  studied. We recommend the application of threshold values for the future with the
  use of the IMU, by ignoring the effects of lower magnitudes of movement, while correcting
  or removing larger magnitudes. In future motion artefact removal, we recommend using
  an IMU for optimal head motion correction of cerebral oxygenation signals'
