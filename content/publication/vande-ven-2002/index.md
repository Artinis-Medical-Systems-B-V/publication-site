abstract: "Study objectives: Effects of chronic metabolic alkalosis and acidosis and\
  \ their relation to central chemoregulation may differ between normocapnic and chronic\
  \ hypercapnic patients with COPD. The relationship between responses of inspired\
  \ ventilation (VI), mouth occlusion pressure (P0.1), and cerebral blood volume (CBV),\
  \ to short-term changes in arterial Pco2 was measured. Patients and methods: Seventeen\
  \ patients with chronic hypercapnia and COPD(Paco2 > 6.0 kPa) and 16 normocapnic\
  \ patients with COPD (Paco2 \u2264 6.0 kPa) [FEV1 27% predicted] were studied under\
  \ baseline metabolic conditions and after 1 week of treatment with oral furosemide,\
  \ 40 mg/d, or acetazolamide, 500 mg/d. Hypercapnia (change in end-tidal carbon dioxide\
  \ > 1 kPa) was induced by administering adequate amounts of carbon dioxide in the\
  \ inspired air. CBV was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy. Results: Compared\
  \ with baseline metabolic condition, chronic metabolic acidosis and alkalosis did\
  \ not change ventilatory ($\u0394$VI/$\u0394$Paco2) and cerebrovascular ($\u0394\
  $CBV/$\u0394$Paco2) reactivity. Base excess (BE) decreased by 6.8 \xB1 1.1 mEq/L\
  \ and 6.9 \xB1 1.6 mEq/L, respectively, in the normocapnic and chronic hypercapnic\
  \ COPD groupsduring metabolic acidosis, resulting in a not-quite-significant leftward\
  \ shift of both the ventilatory and cerebrovascular carbon dioxide response curve.\
  \ BE increased by 2.3 \xB1 1.2 mEq/L and 1.2 \xB1 1.3 mEq/L, respectively, during\
  \ chronic metabolic alkalosis in both COPD groups, without concomitant shift. Poor\
  \ correlations between ventilatory and cerebrovascular carbon dioxide responsiveness\
  \ ($\u0394$CBV/$\u0394$Paco2 and $\u0394$VI/$\u0394$Paco2, $\u0394$CBV/$\u0394$Paco2\
  \ and $\u0394$P0.1/$\u0394$Paco2, respectively) were found irrespective of baseline,\
  \ respiratory condition, and induced metabolic state. Conclusions: Normocapnic and\
  \ chronic hypercapnic COPD patients have the same ventilatory and cerebrovascular\
  \ carbon dioxide responsiveness irrespective of induced metabolic state. \xA9 2002\
