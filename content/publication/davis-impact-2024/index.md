abstract: Low‐load resistance exercise (LLRE) to failure can increase muscle mass,
  strength, endurance, and mitochondrial oxidative capacity (OXPHOS). However, the
  impact of adding blood flow restriction to low‐load resistance exercise (LLBFR)
  when matched for volume on these outcomes is incompletely understood. This pilot
  study examined the impact of 6 weeks of single‐legged LLBFR and volume‐matched LLRE
  on thigh bone‐free lean mass, strength, endurance, and mitochondrial OXPHOS. Twenty
  (12 males and 8 females) untrained young adults (mean ± SD; 21 ± 2 years, 168 ± 11 cm,
  68 ± 12 kg) completed 6 weeks of either single‐legged LLBFR or volume‐matched LLRE.
  Participants performed four sets of 30, 15, 15, and 15 repetitions at 25% 1‐RM of
  leg press and knee extension with or without BFR three times per week. LLBFR increased
  knee extension 1‐RM, knee extension endurance, and thigh bone‐free lean mass relative
  to control (all p textless 0.05). LLRE increased leg press and knee extension 1‐RM
  relative to control (p = 0.012 and p = 0.054, respectively). LLRE also increased
  mitochondrial OXPHOS (p = 0.047 (nonparametric)). Our study showed that LLBFR increased
  muscle strength, muscle endurance, and thigh bone‐free lean mass in the absence
  of improvements in mitochondrial OXPHOS. LLRE improved muscle strength and mitochondrial
  OXPHOS in the absence of improvements in thigh bone‐free lean mass or muscle endurance.
