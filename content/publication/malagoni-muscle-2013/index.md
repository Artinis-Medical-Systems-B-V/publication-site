abstract: "Background: The study of muscle metabolism by near-infrared spectroscopy\
  \ (NIRS) has been poorly implemented in multiple sclerosis (MS). Aims of the study\
  \ were to compare resting muscle oxygen consumption (rmVO2) at gastrocnemius in\
  \ MS patients and in age-matched healthy controls (HC) measured using NIRS, and\
  \ to evaluate its possible relationship with patients' mobility.Methods: Twenty-eight\
  \ consecutively enrolled MS patients (male, n = 16; age = 42.7 \xB1 14.0 y, Relapsing-Remitting,\
  \ n = 19; Primary-Progressive, n = 9) and 22 HC (male, n = 13; age = 36.0 \xB1 8.2\
  \ y) were studied during rest applying the NIRS probes at gastrocnemius, producing\
  \ a venous occlusion at the thigh using a cuff, and analyzing the slope of the total\
  \ hemoglobin to calculate rmVO2. Mobility was assessed by a 6-Minute Walking Test\
  \ and 6-Minute Walking Distance (6MWD) was recorded.Results: rmVO2 was higher in\
  \ MS compared to HC (0.059 \xB1 0.038 vs 0.039 \xB1 0.016 mlO2/min/100 g, P < 0.003),\
  \ not different in clinical subtypes, not correlated to patients' characteristics\
  \ (age, disease duration, Expanded Disability Status Scale, resting heart rate,\
  \ skinfold thickness), and significantly higher in patients with lower walking ability\
  \ (6MWD < 450 m, n = 12) compared to those at better performance (respectively,\
  \ 0.072 \xB1 0.043 vs 0.049 \xB1 0.032 mlO2/min/100 g, P = 0.03).Conclusion: rmVO2\
  \ values, significantly higher in MS patients compared to HC, and in low versus\
  \ high performing patients, might represent a marker of peripheral adaptations occurred\
  \ to sustain mobility, as observed in other chronic diseases. \xA9 2013 Malagoni\
