abstract: "Thinking creatively requires the ability to consciously augment creative\
  \ insight through processes such as analogical reasoning and relational cognition.\
  \ Prior work has examined augmented states of creativity using a modified verb generation\
  \ task which requires brief engagement in attempts to think creatively during MRI.\
  \ In this study, we employed the verb generation task to examine augmented creative\
  \ states and frontopolar cortex activation in a less-constrained setting using functional\
  \ near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Participants (n = 29) were presented with\
  \ a noun and were required to think of an associated verb. In 50% of the trials,\
  \ participants were instructed to \u2018think creatively' (cued condition) as opposed\
  \ to stating the first or most prominent verb that came to mind (uncued condition).\
  \ The task was administered in French to native speakers. Hemodynamic responses\
  \ were recorded over the frontopolar cortex using fNIRS. The relatedness of the\
  \ noun-verb pairs was calculated and other measures of creativity (the Alternate\
  \ Uses Test, Compound Remote Associate Test and the Biographical Inventory of Creative\
  \ Behaviors) were recorded. We showed that in the cued condition, semantic scores\
  \ were higher (indicating more creative responses), positively associated with other\
  \ measures of creativity, and changes in oxygenated hemoglobin were larger and more\
  \ extensive in the left frontopolar cortex, than in the uncued condition. Our findings\
  \ support the use of the verb generation task (administered in French) to augment\
  \ creative states and provides further validation of the use of the task to capture\
  \ creativity (i.e., processes involved in generating creative responses through\
  \ distant associations). We highlight the use of fNIRS to measure associated regional\
  \ changes in frontopolar cortex activity during augmented states of creativity."
