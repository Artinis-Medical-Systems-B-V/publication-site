abstract: "It was the purpose of this study to examine the effect of a priming contractile\
  \ bout on oxygen, uptake (V\u0307o2) on-kinetics in highly oxidative skeletal muscle.\
  \ Canine gastrocnemii (n = 12) were stimulated via their sciatic nerves (8 V, 0.2-ms\
  \ duration, 50 Hz, 200-ms train) at a rate of 2 contractions/3 s (\u224870% peak\
  \ V\u0307o2) for two 2-min bouts, separated by 2 min of recovery. Blood flow was\
  \ recorded with an ultrasonic flowmeter, and muscle oxygenation monitored via near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy. Compared with the first bout (bout 2 vs. bout 1), the V\u0307o2\
  \ primary time constant (mean \xB1 SD, 9.4 \xB1 2.3 vs. 12.0 \xB1 3.9 s) and slowcomponent\
  \ amplitude (5.9 \xB1 6.3 vs. 12.1 \xB1 9.0 ml O 2\u02D9kg wet wt-1\u02D9min-1)\
  \ were significantly reduced (P < 0.05) during the second bout. Blood flow on-kinetics\
  \ were significantly speeded during the second bout (time constant = 7.7 \xB1 2.6\
  \ vs. 14.8 \xB1 5.8 s), and O2 extraction was greater at the onset of contractions\
  \ (0.050 \xB1 0.030 vs. 0.020 \xB1 0.010 ml 02/ml blood). Kinetics of muscle deoxygenation\
  \ were significantly slower at the onset of the second bout (7.2 \xB1 2.2 vs. 4.4\
  \ \xB1 1.2 s), while relative oxyhemoglobin concentration was elevated throughout\
  \ the second bout. These results suggest that better matching of O2 delivery to\
  \ V\u0307o2 speeds V\u0307o2 on-kinetics at this metabolic rate, but do not eliminate\
  \ a potential role for enhanced metabolic activation. Additionally, altered motor\
  \ unit recruitment at the onset of a second bout is not a prerequisite for reductions\
  \ in the V\u0307o2 slow-component amplitude after a priming contractile bout in\
  \ canine muscle in situ. Copyright \xA9 2010 the American. Physiological Society."
