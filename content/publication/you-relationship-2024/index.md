abstract: 'Objectives: Short sleep is becoming more common in modern society. This
  study aimed to explore the relationship between accelerometer-measured sleep duration
  and cognitive performance among young adults as well as the underlying hemodynamic
  mechanisms. Methods: A total of 58 participants were included in this study. Participants
  were asked to wear an ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer to identify their sleep duration
  for 7 consecutive days. Cognitive function was assessed by the Stroop test. Two
  conditions, including the congruent and incongruent Stroop, were set. In addition,
  stratified analyses were used to examine sensitivity. 24-channel functional near-infrared
  spectroscopy (fNIRS) equipment was applied to measure hemodynamic changes of the
  prefrontal cortex (PFC) during cognitive tasks. Results: Results showed that sleep
  duration was positively associated with accuracy of the incongruent Stroop test
  (0.001 (0.000, 0.002), p = 0.042). Compared with the regular sleep (≥7 h) group,
  lower accuracy of the incongruent Stroop test (−0.012 (−0.023, −0.002), p = 0.024)
  was observed in the severe short sleep (textless6 h). Moreover, a stratified analysis
  was conducted to examining gender, age, BMI, birthplace, and education’s impact
  on sleep duration and the incongruent Stroop test accuracy, confirming a consistent
  correlation across all demographics. In the severe short sleep group, the activation
  of left middle frontal gyri and right dorsolateral superior frontal gyri were negatively
  associated with the cognitive performance. Conclusions: This study emphasized the
  importance of maintaining enough sleep schedules in young college students from
  a fNIRS perspective. The findings of this study could potentially be used to guide
  sleep time in young adults and help them make sleep schemes.'
