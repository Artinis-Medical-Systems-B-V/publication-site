abstract: "The aim of this study was to locate the breakpoints of cerebral and muscle\
  \ oxygenation and muscle electrical activity during a ramp exercise in reference\
  \ to the first and second ventilatory thresholds. Twenty-five cyclists completed\
  \ a maximal ramp test on an electromagnetically braked cycle-ergometer with a rate\
  \ of increment of 25 W/min. Expired gazes (breath-by-breath), prefrontal cortex\
  \ and vastus lateralis (VL) oxygenation [Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)] together\
  \ with electromyographic (EMG) Root Mean Square (RMS) activity for the VL, rectus\
  \ femoris (RF), and biceps femoris (BF) muscles were continuously assessed. There\
  \ was a non-linear increase in both cerebral deoxyhemoglobin (at 56 \xB1 13% of\
  \ the exercise) and oxyhemoglobin (56 \xB1 8% of exercise) concomitantly to the\
  \ first ventilatory threshold (57 \xB1 6% of exercise, p > 0.86, Cohen's d < 0.1).\
  \ Cerebral deoxyhemoglobin further increased (87 \xB1 10% of exercise) while oxyhemoglobin\
  \ reached a plateau/decreased (86 \xB1 8% of exercise) after the second ventilatory\
  \ threshold (81 \xB1 6% of exercise, p < 0.05, d > 0.8). We identified one threshold\
  \ only for muscle parameters with a non-linear decrease in muscle oxyhemoglobin\
  \ (78 \xB1 9% of exercise), attenuation in muscle deoxyhemoglobin (80 \xB1 8% of\
  \ exercise), and increase in EMG activity of VL (89 \xB1 5% of exercise), RF (82\
  \ \xB1 14% of exercise), and BF (85 \xB1 9% of exercise). The thresholds in BF and\
  \ VL EMG activity occurred after the second ventilatory threshold (p < 0.05, d >\
  \ 0.6). Our results suggest that the metabolic and ventilatory events characterizing\
  \ this latter cardiopulmonary threshold may affect both cerebral and muscle oxygenation\
  \ levels, and in turn, muscle recruitment responses. \xA9 2014 Racinais, Buchheit\
