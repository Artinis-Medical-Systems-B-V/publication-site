abstract: "Hemibody movements are strongly considered as being under the control of\
  \ the contralateral hemisphere of the cerebral cortex. However, some neuroimaging\
  \ studies have found a bilateral activation of either the primary sensori-motor\
  \ (SM1) areas or the rostral prefrontal cortex (PFC), during unimanual tasks. More\
  \ than just bilateral, the activation of these areas was found to be symmetrical\
  \ in some studies. However, the symmetrical response remains strongly controversial\
  \ notably for handgrip force generations. We therefore aimed to examine the bilateral\
  \ SM1 and rostral PFC area activations in response to graded submaximal force generation\
  \ during a unilateral handgrip task. Fifteen healthy subjects performed 6 levels\
  \ of force (ranging from 5 to 50% of MVC) during a handgrip task. We concomitantly\
  \ measured the activation of bilateral SM1 and rostral PFC areas through near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy (NIRS) and the electromyographic (EMG) activity of the bilateral\
  \ flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) muscles. Symmetrical activation was found\
  \ over the SM1 areas for all the investigated levels of force. At the highest level\
  \ of force (i.e., 50% of MVC), the EMG of the passive FDS increased significantly\
  \ and the ipsilateral rostral PFC activation was found more intense than the corresponding\
  \ contralateral rostral PFC activation. We suggest that the visuo-guided control\
  \ of force levels during a handgrip task requires the cross-talk from ipsi- to contralateral\
  \ SM1 to cope for the relative complexity of the task, similar to that which occurs\
  \ during complex sequential finger movement. We also propose alternative explanations\
  \ for the observed symmetrical SM1 activation including (i) the ipsilateral corticospinal\
  \ tract and (ii) interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) mechanism. The increase in EMG\
  \ activity over the passive FDS could be associated with a release of IHI at 50%\
  \ of MVC. Finally, our results suggest that the greater ipsilateral (right) rostral\
  \ PFC activation may reflect the greater demand of attention required to control\
  \ the motor output at high levels of force. \xA9 2013 Elsevier Inc."
