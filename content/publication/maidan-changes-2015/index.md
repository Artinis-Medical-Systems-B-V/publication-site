abstract: "Recent studies have suggested that deficits in executive function contribute\
  \ to freezing of gait (FOG), an episodic disturbance common among patients with\
  \ Parkinson's disease (PD). To date, most findings provide only indirect evidence\
  \ of this relationship. Here, we evaluated a more direct link between FOG and frontal\
  \ lobe dysfunction. Functional, near infrared spectroscopy measured frontal activation,\
  \ i.e., oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) levels in Brodmann area 10 before and during\
  \ FOG. Eleven patients with PD and eleven healthy older adults were studied. Changes\
  \ in frontal lobe activation before and during FOG that occurred during turns were\
  \ determined. Altogether, 49 FOG episodes were observed\u201428 occurred during\
  \ turns that were anticipated (i.e., the patient knew in advance that the turn was\
  \ coming), 21 during unanticipated turns that were performed \u201Cabruptly\u201D\
  , according to the examiner's request. During anticipated turns, HbO2 increased\
  \ by 0.22\_\xB1\_0.08\_\xB5M (p\_=\_0.004) before FOG and by an additional 0.19\_\
  \xB1\_0.13\_\xB5M (p\_=\_0.072) during FOG. In contrast, during unanticipated turns,\
  \ HbO2 did not increase before or during FOG. HbO2 decreased by 0.32\_\xB1\_0.08\_\
  \xB5M (p\_=\_0.004) during turns without FOG; in healthy controls HbO2 did not change\
  \ during turns. These findings support the existence of an association between FOG\
  \ episodes and changes in frontal lobe HbO2. Increased activation in Brodmann area\
  \ 10 before FOG, specifically during anticipated turns, highlights the connections\
  \ between motor planning, information processing, and FOG. These results support\
  \ the idea that alterations in executive control play a role in this debilitating\
  \ motor disturbance."
