abstract: "Background: The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is involved with\
  \ allocating attentional resources to maintain postural control. However, it is\
  \ unknown whether age-related structural and functional declines of the DLPFC may\
  \ impair postural control during sensory manipulation. In this study, we aim to\
  \ understand the effects of aging on the DLPFC when sensory cues were removed or\
  \ presented inaccurately (i.e., increased sensory complexity) during the sensory\
  \ orientation test (SOT). Methods: Twenty young (18\u201325\_years) and 18 older\
  \ (66\u201373\_years) healthy adults were recruited to undertake the SOT, which\
  \ consisted of six conditions aimed at removing or disrupting the visual, vestibular,\
  \ and proprioceptive senses. During these six SOT conditions, functional near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy (fNIRS), consisting of eight transmitter-receiver optode pairs (four\
  \ channels over the left and right DLPFC), was used to measure hemodynamic responses\
  \ (i.e., changes in oxy- [O2Hb] and deoxyhemoglobin [HHb]) from the bilateral DLPFC.\
  \ Results: Our results show an increase in bilateral DLPFC activation (i.e., increase\
  \ in O2Hb and concomitant smaller decrease in HHb) with increasing sensory complexity\
  \ in both young and older adults. The increase in left and right DLPFC activation\
  \ during more complex sensory conditions was greater, which was concomitant with\
  \ reduced balance performance in older adults compared to younger adults. Furthermore,\
  \ we observed a right lateralized DLPFC activation in younger adults. Finally, a\
  \ significant positive association was observed between balance performance and\
  \ increased bilateral DLPFC activation particularly for SOT conditions with greater\
  \ sensory disruptions. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the involvement of the\
  \ DLPFC in maintaining postural control, particularly during complex sensory tasks,\
  \ and provide direct evidence for the role of the DLPFC during postural control\
  \ of a clinically relevant measure of balance."
