abstract: "Frailty in older adults is characterised by dysregulation in multiple physiological\
  \ systems. The frailty phenotype is defined on the basis of exhaustion, unexplained\
  \ weight loss, weakness, slowness and low physical activity (one or two: pre-frail;\
  \ 3 or more: frail). Our aim was to explore if increasing frailty is associated\
  \ with the complexity of resting state physiological signals in a large cohort of\
  \ community-dwelling older adults, enrolled as part of The Irish Longitudinal Study\
  \ on Ageing (TILDA). Systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP), mean arterial\
  \ pressure (MAP), and heart rate (HR) were measured in 3154 participants (66.2%\
  \ non-frail; 31.3% pre-frail; 2.5% frail) using a Finometer\xAEdevice at 200 Hz;\
  \ and frontal lobe oxygenation (tissue saturation index (TSI)) in 2749 individuals\
  \ (66.3% non-frail; 31.3% pre-frail; 2.4% frail) at 50Hz using an Artinis Portalite\xAE\
  near infrared spectroscopy system. Data were acquired continuously during five minutes\
  \ of supine rest and the last minute (downsampled to 5 Hz) was utilised in these\
  \ analyses. The complexity of signals was quantified using approximate entropy (ApEn)\
  \ with m = 2 and an optimal r derived via multiple iterations, implemented in Matlab\
  \ (R2019a). Statistical analysis was performed using multivariate linear regression\
  \ models in STATA (v14.1), controlling for age, sex, education, antihypertensive\
  \ medication, diabetes, number of cardiovascular conditions, smoking, alcohol, and\
  \ depression. Mean age for both groups was 64.3 \xB1 8.1 years and 53% were female.\
  \ The pre-frail group was associated with significantly increased ApEn for all measures\
  \ investigated (sBP: $\u03B2$ = 0.014, p \u2264 0.001; dBP: $\u03B2$ = 0.009, p\
  \ = 0.002; MAP: $\u03B2$ = 0.012, p \u2264 0.001; HR: $\u03B2$ = 0.011, p = 0.003;\
  \ TSI: $\u03B2$ = 0.009, p = 0.002). Likewise, the frail group was associated with\
  \ further increased ApEn for all measures investigated (sBP: $\u03B2$ = 0.031, p\
  \ = 0.002; dBP: $\u03B2$ = 0.028, p = 0.003; MAP: $\u03B2$ = 0.038, p \u2264 0.001;\
  \ HR: $\u03B2$ = 0.034, p = 0.001; TSI: $\u03B2$ = 0.018, p = 0.029). Approximate\
  \ entropy seems to be a sensitive method to capture increasing signal complexity\
  \ in multiple physiological systems associated with the frailty phenotype during\
  \ resting state."
