abstract: 'This study aimed to investigate the effects of caffeine on performances
  of simulated match, Wingate Anaerobic Test (WAnT), and cognitive function test of
  elite taekwondo athletes. Ten elite taekwondo athletes in Hong Kong volunteered
  to participate in two main trials in a randomized double-blinded crossover design.
  In each main trial, 1 h after consuming a drink with caffeine (CAF) or a placebo
  drink without caffeine (PLA), the participants completed two simulated taekwondo
  match sessions followed by the WAnT. The participants were instructed to complete
  three cognitive function tests, namely the Eriksen Flanker Test (EFT), Stroop Test,
  and Rapid Visual Information Processing Test, at baseline, before exercise, and
  immediately after the simulated matches. They were also required to wear functional
  near-infrared spectroscopy equipment during these tests. Before exercise, the reaction
  time in the EFT was shorter in the CAF trial than in the PLA trial (PLA: 494.9 ±
  49.2 ms vs. CAF: 467.9 ± 38.0 ms, p = 0.035). In the WAnT, caffeine intake increased
  the peak power and mean power per unit of body weight (by approximately 13% and
  6%, respectively, p = 0.018 & 0.042). The performance in the simulated matches was
  not affected by caffeine intake (p = 0.168). In conclusion, caffeine intake enhances
  anaerobic power and may improve certain cognitive functions of elite taekwondo athletes
  in Hong Kong. However, this may not be enough to improve the simulated match performance.'
