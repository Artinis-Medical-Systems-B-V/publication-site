abstract: 'Microvascular autoregulation (MA) maintains adequate tissue perfusion over
  a range of arterial blood pressure (ABP) and is frequently impaired in critical
  illness. MA has been studied in the brain to derive personalized hemodynamic targets
  after brain injury. The ability to measure MA in other organs is not known, which
  may inform individualized management during shock. OBJECTIVES: This study determines
  the feasibility of measuring MA in skeletal muscle using near-infrared spectroscopy
  (NIRS) as a marker of tissue perfusion, the derivation of optimal mean arterial
  pressure (MAPopt), and comparison with indices from the brain. DESIGN: Prospective
  observational study. SETTING: Medical and surgical ICU in a tertiary academic hospital.
  PARTICIPANTS: Adult critically ill patients requiring vasoactive support on the
  first day of ICU admission. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Fifteen critically ill patients
  were enrolled. NIRS was applied simultaneously to skeletal muscle (brachioradialis)
  and brain (frontal cortex) while ABP was measured continuously via invasive catheter.
  MA correlation indices were calculated between ABP and NIRS from skeletal muscle
  total hemoglobin (MVx), muscle tissue saturation index (MOx), brain total hemoglobin
  (THx), and brain tissue saturation index (COx). Curve fitting algorithms derive
  the MAP with the lowest correlation index value, which is the MAPopt. RESULTS: MAPopt
  values were successfully calculated for each correlation index for all patients
  and were frequently (77%) above 65 mm Hg. For all correlation indices, median time
  was substantially above impaired MA threshold (24.5–34.9%) and below target MAPopt
  (9.0–78.6%). Muscle and brain MAPopt show moderate correlation (MVx–THx r = 0.76,
  p textless 0.001; MOx–COx p = 0.005), with a median difference of –1.27 mm Hg (–9.85
  to –0.18 mm Hg) and 0.05 mm Hg (–7.05 to 2.68 mm Hg). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:
  This study demonstrates, for the first time, the feasibility of calculating MA indices
  and MAPopt in skeletal muscle using NIRS. Future studies should explore the association
  between impaired skeletal muscle MA, ICU outcomes, and organ-specific differences
  in MA and MAPopt thresholds.'
