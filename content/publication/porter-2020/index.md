abstract: "This study examined performance and physiological responses (power output,\
  \ tissue saturation index) to repeat sprint cycling with oxygen supplementation\
  \ (O2Supp [fraction of inspired oxygen 1.00]). Fourteen amateur male cyclists took\
  \ part. Two visits to the laboratory entailed; 15min relative intensity warm-up,\
  \ 10min of passive recovery, followed by 10x15s repeated sprints, during which air\
  \ inspired had FiO2 1.00 oxygen or normal air. Outcome measures include, mean power\
  \ (W) and change in Tissue Saturation Index ($\u0394$TSI%). Repeated measures ANOVA\
  \ were used to examine difference between conditions in mean power output. Paired\
  \ samples t-tests were used to examine differences between conditions in $\u0394\
  $TSI (%) and rate of muscle reoxygenation and deoxygenation (%\u02D9s-1). Mean power\
  \ output was 4% higher in the oxygen condition compared to normoxia (p <.01). There\
  \ was a significant positive correlation between power output and reoxygenation\
  \ rate during O2Supp (r = 0.65, p =.04). No correlation was seen between power output\
  \ and reoxygenation rate during normoxia (r =-0.30, p =.40). A significantly increased\
  \ deoxy rate was seen in the O2Supp condition compared to normoxia (p =.05). Oxygen\
  \ supplementation appears to elicit the greatest performance improvements in mean\
  \ power, potentially facilitated by an increasing muscle reoxygenation rate. This\
  \ evidences the utility of oxygen as an ergogenic aid to in cycling performance."
