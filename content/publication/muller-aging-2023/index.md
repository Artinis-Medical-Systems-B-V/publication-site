abstract: 'Healthy aging leads to poorer performance in upper limb (UL) daily living
  movements. Understanding the neural correlates linked with UL functional movements
  may help to better understand how healthy aging affects motor control. Two non-invasive
  neuroimaging methods allow for monitoring the movement-related brain activity: functional
  near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG), respectively
  based on the hemodynamic response and electrical activity of brain regions. Coupled,
  they provide a better spatiotemporal mapping. The aim of this study was to evaluate
  the effect of healthy aging on the bilateral sensorimotor (SM1) activation patterns
  of functional proximal UL movements. Twenty-one young and 21 old healthy participants
  realized two unilateral proximal UL movements during: i) a paced reaching target
  task and ii) a circular steering task to capture the speed-accuracy trade-off. Combined
  fNIRS-EEG system was synchronised with movement capture system to record SM1 activation
  while moving. The circular steering task performance was significantly lower for
  the older group. The rate of increase in hemodynamic response was longer in the
  older group with no difference on the amplitude of fNIRS signal for the two tasks.
  The EEG results showed aging related reduction of the alpha-beta rhythms synchronisation
  but no desynchronisation modification. In conclusion, this study uncovers the age-related
  changes in brain electrical and hemodynamic response patterns in the bilateral sensorimotor
  network during two functional proximal UL movements using two complementary neuroimaging
  methods. This opens up the possibility to utilise combined fNIRS-EEG for monitoring
  the movement-related neuroplasticity in clinical practice.'
