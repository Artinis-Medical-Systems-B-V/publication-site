abstract: "The recovery of muscle oxygen consumption (m (Formula presented.) O2) after\
  \ exercise measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) provides a measure of\
  \ skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity. Nevertheless, due to sex differences in\
  \ factors that can influence scattering and thus penetration depth of the NIRS signal\
  \ in the tissue, e.g., subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness and intramuscular myoglobin\
  \ and hemoglobin, it is unknown whether results in males can be extrapolated to\
  \ a female population. Therefore, the aim of this study was to measure skeletal\
  \ muscle mitochondrial capacity in females at different levels of aerobic fitness\
  \ to test whether NIRS can measure relevant differences in mitochondrial capacity.\
  \ Mitochondrial capacity was analyzed in the gastrocnemius muscle and the wrist\
  \ flexors of 32 young female adults, equally divided in relatively high ((Formula\
  \ presented.) O2peak \u2265 47 ml/kg/min) and relatively low aerobic fitness group\
  \ ((Formula presented.) O2peak \u2264 37 ml/kg/min). m (Formula presented.) O2 recovery\
  \ was significantly faster in the high- compared to the low-fitness group in the\
  \ gastrocnemius, but not in the wrist flexors (p = 0.009 and p = 0.0528, respectively).\
  \ Furthermore, (Formula presented.) O2peak was significantly correlated to m (Formula\
  \ presented.) O2 recovery in both gastrocnemius (R2 = 0.27, p = 0.0051) and wrist\
  \ flexors (R2 = 0.13, p = 0.0393). In conclusion, NIRS measurements can be used\
  \ to assess differences in mitochondrial capacity within a female population and\
  \ is correlated to (Formula presented.) O2peak. This further supports NIRS assessment\
  \ of muscle mitochondrial capacity providing additional evidence for NIRS as a promising\
  \ approach to monitor mitochondrial capacity, also in an exclusively female population."
