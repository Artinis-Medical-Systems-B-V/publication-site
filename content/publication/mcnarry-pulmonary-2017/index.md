abstract: "Background: Little is known about the mechanistic basis for the exercise\
  \ intolerance characteristic of patients with respiratory disease; a lack of clearly\
  \ defined, distinct patient groups limits interpretation of many studies. The purpose\
  \ of this pilot study was to investigate the pulmonary oxygen uptake (V\u02D9: O2)\
  \ response, and its potential determinants, in patients with emphysema and idiopathic\
  \ pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Methods: Following a ramp incremental test for the determination\
  \ of peak V\u02D9: O2 and the gas exchange threshold, six emphysema (66 \xB1 7 years;\
  \ FEV1, 36 \xB1 16%), five IPF (65 \xB1 12 years; FEV1, 82 \xB1 11%) and ten healthy\
  \ control participants (63 \xB1 6 years) completed three repeat, heavy-intensity\
  \ exercise transitions on a cycle ergometer. Throughout each transition, pulmonary\
  \ gas exchange, heart rate and muscle deoxygenation ([HHb], patients only) were\
  \ assessed continuously and subsequently modelled using a mono-exponential with\
  \ (V\u02D9: O2, [HHb]) or without (HR) a time delay. Results: The V\u02D9: O2 phase\
  \ II time-constant ($\u03C4$) did not differ between IPF and emphysema, with both\
  \ groups significantly slower than healthy controls (Emphysema, 65 \xB1 11; IPF,\
  \ 69 \xB1 7; Control, 31 \xB1 7 s; P < 0.05). The HR $\u03C4$ was slower in emphysema\
  \ relative to IPF, with both groups significantly slower than controls (Emphysema,\
  \ 87 \xB1 19; IPF, 119 \xB1 20; Control, 58 \xB1 11 s; P < 0.05). In contrast, neither\
  \ the [HHb] $\u03C4$ nor [HHb]:O2 ratio differed between patient groups. Conclusions:\
  \ The slower V\u02D9: O2 kinetics in emphysema and IPF may reflect poorer matching\
  \ of O2 delivery-to-utilisation. Our findings extend our understanding of the exercise\
  \ dysfunction in patients with respiratory disease and may help to inform the development\
  \ of appropriately targeted rehabilitation strategies."
