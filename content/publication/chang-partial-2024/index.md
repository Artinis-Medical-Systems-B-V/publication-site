abstract: Establishing proper trust between human workers and robots is crucial for
  ensuring safe and effective human-robot interaction in various industries, including
  construction. An accurate trust prediction facilitates timely feedback and interventions,
  helping  workers calibrate their trust levels. While machine learning modeling personalization
  (i.e., tailoring  models to individual characteristics) has garnered attention in
  the literature, the conventional approach of developing a personalized model for
  each  individual is impractical in labor-intensive industries like construction.
  Such an approach compromises efficiency and leads to an accuracy-efficiency tradeoff.
  To address this gap, this study aims to investigate the tradeoff inherent in model
  personalization and identify a cost-effective solution to enhance trust prediction
  accuracy without compromising efficiency.  The results suggested that a partial
  model personalization method can effectively balance this tradeoff. Moreover, the
  proposed feature-based partial personalization approach enables a cost effective
  trust prediction model development for the construction industry, demonstrating
  its broader  applicability to other worker-related predictions in other settings.
  This study provides insights into the strategies to improve trust prediction accuracy
  while maintaining the efficiency of model development by considering the distinctiveness
  of the future construction industry.
