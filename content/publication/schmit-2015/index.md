abstract: 'This study aimed at investigating concurrent changes in cognitive control
  and cerebral oxygenation (Cox) during steady intense exercise to volitional exhaustion.
  Fifteen participants were monitored using prefrontal near-infrared spectroscopy
  and electromyography of the thumb muscles during the completion of an Eriksen flanker
  task completed either at rest (control condition) or while cycling at a strenuous
  intensity until exhaustion (exercise condition). Two time windows were matched between
  the conditions to distinguish a potential exercise-induced evolutive cognitive effect:
  an initial period and a terminal period. In the initial period, Cox remained unaltered
  and, contrary to theoretical predictions, exercise did not induce any deficit in
  selective response inhibition. Rather, the drop-off of the delta curve as reaction
  time lengthened suggested enhanced efficiency of cognitive processes in the first
  part of the exercise bout. Shortly before exhaustion, Cox values were severely reduced
  - though not characteristic of a hypofrontality state - while no sign of deficit
  in selective response inhibition was observed. Despite this, individual''s susceptibility
  to making fast impulsive errors increased and less efficient online correction of
  incorrect activation was observed near exhaustion. A negative correlation between
  Cox values and error rate was observed and is discussed in terms of cerebral resources
  redistribution.'
