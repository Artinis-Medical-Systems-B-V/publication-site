abstract: Equine-assisted services (EAS) are used for civilian and military trauma
  survivors to reduce depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms. While early scientific
  evidence supports the benefits of EAS, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying
  these benefits are unknown. The specific aims of this exploratory study were to
  determine (1) whether functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging
  can be used to explore neural responses of EAS veteran participants and (2) the
  correlation between neural responses and psychological outcomes of the participants
  interacting with equines. Fifteen veterans participated in a 2-day EAS program consisting
  of four randomized activities. An fNIRS sensor cap was used to measure the oxygenated
  (O2Hb), deoxygenated (hHb), and total hemoglobin (tHb) of the participants during
  each activity. The results indicated no significant differences for O2Hb and tHb
  across the visits or activities, however, a significant difference in hHb was observed.
  There was an increase in hHb during the activities that included an equine, which
  indicated a greater cognitive load and attention. Further, data from pre-/post-psychometric
  assessments showed a significant improvement in participantsâ€™ trait anxiety, psychological
  flexibility, and positive and negative affect after interacting with the horse.
  Preliminary data revealed a potential association between the cognitive attention
  and psychological health of participants during an EAS session.
