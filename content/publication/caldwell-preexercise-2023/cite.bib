Acute aerobic exercise stress is associated with decreased endothelial function that may increase the likelihood of an acute cardiovascular event. Passive stretch (PS) elicits improvements in vascular function, but whether PS can be performed before exercise to prevent declines in vascular function remains unknown. This strategy could be directly applicable in populations that may not be able to perform dynamic exercise. We hypothesized that preexercise PS would provide better vascular resilience after treadmill exercise. Sixteen healthy college-aged males and females participated in a single laboratory visit and underwent testing to assess micro- and macrovascular function. Participants were randomized into either PS group or sham control group. Intermittent calf PS was performed by having the foot in a splinting device for a 5-min stretch and 5-min relaxation, repeated four times. Then, a staged V̇o

peak test was performed and 65% V̇o

peak calculated for subjects to run at for 30 min. Near-infrared spectroscopy-derived microvascular responsiveness was preserved with the PS group [(pre: 0.53 ± 0.009%/s) (post: 0.56 ± 0.012%/s; P = 0.55)]. However, there was a significant reduction in the sham control group [(pre: 0.67 ± 0.010%/s) (post: 0.51 ± 0.007%/s; P = 0.05)] after treadmill exercise. Flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) of the popliteal artery showed similar responses. In the PS group, FMD [(pre: 7.23 ± 0.74%) (post: 5.86 ± 1.01%; P = 0.27)] did not significantly decline after exercise. In the sham control group, FMD [(pre: 8.69 ± 0.72%) (post: 5.24 ± 1.24%; P \textless 0.001)] was significantly reduced after treadmill exercise. Vascular function may be more resilient if intermittent PS is performed before moderate-intensity exercise and, importantly, can be performed by most individuals.

NEW & NOTEWORTHY We demonstrate for the first time that popliteal artery and gastrocnemius microvascular responsiveness after acute aerobic exercise are reduced. The decline in vascular function was mitigated in those who performed intermittent passive stretching before the exercise bouts. Collectively, these findings suggest that intermittent passive stretching is a novel method to increase vascular resiliency before aerobic activity.},
