abstract: "Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) has recently gained interest both for\
  \ breast cancer screening and diagnosis. Its employment has increased also in conjunction\
  \ with digital mammography (DM), to improve cancer detection and reduce false positive\
  \ recall rate. Synthetic mammograms (SMs) reconstructed from DBT data have been\
  \ introduced to replace DM in the DBT + DM approach, for preserving the benefits\
  \ of the dual-acquisition modality whilst reducing radiation dose and compression\
  \ time. Therefore, different DBT models have been commercialized and the effective\
  \ potential of each system has been investigated. In particular, wide-angle DBT\
  \ was shown to provide better depth resolution than narrow-angle DBT, while narrow-angle\
  \ DBT allows better identification of microcalcifications compared to wide-angle\
  \ DBT. Given the increasing employment of SMs as supplement to DBT, a comparison\
  \ of image quality between SMs obtained in narrow-angle and wide-angle DBT is of\
  \ practical interest. Therefore, the aim of this phantom study was to evaluate and\
  \ compare the image quality of SMs reconstructed from 15\xB0 (SM15) and 40\xB0 (SM40)\
  \ DBT in a commercial system. Spatial resolution, noise and contrast properties\
  \ were evaluated through the modulation transfer function (MTF), noise power spectrum,\
  \ maps of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), image contrast, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)\
  \ and contrast-detail (CD) thresholds. SM40 expressed higher MTF than SM15, but\
  \ also lower SNR and CNR levels. SM15 and SM40 were characterized by slight different\
  \ texture, and a different behavior in terms of contrast was found. SM15 provided\
  \ better CD performances than SM40. These results suggest that the employment of\
  \ wide/narrow-angle DBT + SM images should be optimized based on the specific image\
  \ task."
