abstract: "The aim of this study was to induce acute metabolic acid/base changes of\
  \ \u2265 2 mequiv \u02D9 l-1 change in base excess (BE) to aid future investigations\
  \ of respiratory parameters under these conditions. Ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) was\
  \ administered to induce acidification and furosemide was used to induce alkalization.\
  \ Nine healthy volunteers (six men and three women aged 35 \xB1 18 years) ingested\
  \ a calculated amount of NH4Cl at t = 0 and a repeat dose after 60 min. Eight healthy\
  \ volunteers (three men and five women aged 37 \xB1 16 years) consumed 40 mg of\
  \ furosemide. Arterialized capillary blood gases were measured at t = 0, 30, 60,\
  \ 90, 120 and 180 min. In the case of acute metabolic acidosis, the target acidification\
  \ of 2 mequiv \u02D9 l-1 was attained after 30 min and the greatest change was achieved\
  \ at 90 min: -4.9 (2.2) mequiv \u02D9 l-1. In the case of acute metabolic alkalosis,\
  \ the target alkalization of 2 mequiv \u02D9 l-1 was reached between 120 and 180\
  \ min and the greatest change was seen at 180 min: +2.2 (1.4) mequiv \u02D9 l-1.\
  \ Significant (P < 0.05) changes in acidification compared with baseline BE values\
  \ were found between 60 and 180 min; significant (P < 0.05) changes in alkalization\
  \ were found between 120 and 150 min. Paco2 did not change significantly in either\
  \ condition. We conclude that NH4Cl and furosemide induce a steady state of pure\
  \ metabolic acid/base conditions in humans, which is buffered in an isocapnic manner."
