abstract: Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) have so far been used primarily in the medical
  context. The question arises whether an interface between brain and user device
  could be established as an innovative technology in everyday life and which potential
  disruptive factors would have to be taken into account.  The investigations conducted
  for this paper intend to show whether the mirror neuron effect is a confounding
  factor for BCI with fNIRS as a means of thought-based device control for people
  with uninhibited motor skills. A further aim was to gain insights into whether there
  is a difference in the mirror neuron effect between looking at a stranger and looking
  at oneself while performing a waving movement.  The conducted research showed that
  the subjects’ reactions to a seen movement were stronger than the reactions to an
  imagined movement. Thus, the mirror neuron effect represents a confounding factor
  for thought-based device control via fNIRS.  Furthermore, no significant difference
  was found between the responses to a stranger waving and the subjects themselves
  carrying out the motion. Although the subjects’ reactions to seeing themselves were
  slightly increased, the available data does not allow for definite conclusions in
  this matter.
