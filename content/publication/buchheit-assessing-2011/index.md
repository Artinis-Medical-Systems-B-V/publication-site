abstract: "Purpose: To examine physiological responses to submaximal field running\
  \ with changes of direction (COD), and to compare two approaches to assess running\
  \ economy (RE) with COD, ie, during square-wave (SW) and incremental (INC) exercises.\
  \ Methods: Ten male team-sport athletes performed, in straight-line or over 20 m\
  \ shuttles, one maximal INC and four submaximal SW (45, 60, 75 and 90% of the velocity\
  \ associated with maximal pulmonary O2 uptake [vVO 2pmax]). Pulmonary (VO2p) and\
  \ gastrocnemius (VO 2m) O2 uptake were computed for all tests. For both running\
  \ mode, RE was estimated as the O2 cost per kilogram of bodyweight, per meter of\
  \ running during all SW and INC. Results: Compared with straight-line runs, shuttle\
  \ runs were associated with higher VO2p (eg, 33 \xB1 6 vs 37 \xB1 5 mL O2\u02D9\
  min -1\u02D9kg-1 at 60%, P <.01) and VO2m (eg, 1.1 \xB1 0.5 vs 1.3 \xB1 0.8 mL O2\u02D9\
  min -1\u02D9100 g-1 at 60%, P = .18, Cohen's d = 0.32). With COD, RE was impaired\
  \ during SW (0.26 \xB1 0.02 vs 0.24 \xB1 0.03 mL O2\u02D9kg-1\u02D9m-1, P <.01)\
  \ and INC (0.23 \xB1 0.04 vs 0.16 \xB1 0.03 mL O2\u02D9kg -1\u02D9m-1, P < .001).\
  \ For both SW and INC tests, the changes in RE with COD were related to height (eg,\
  \ r = .56 [90%CL, 0.01;0.85] for SW) and weekly training/competitive volume (eg,\
  \ r = -0.58 [-0.86;-0.04] for SW). For both running modes, RE calculated from INC\
  \ was better than that from SW (both P <.001). Conclusion: Although RE is impaired\
  \ during field running with COD, team-sport players of shorter stature and/or presenting\
  \ greater training/competitive volumes may present a lower RE deterioration with\
  \ COD. Present results do not support the use of INC to assess RE in the field,\
  \ irrespective of running mode. \xA9 2011 Human Kinetics, Inc."
