abstract: 'Introduction: There is a well-established relationship between the respiratory
  compensation point (RCP) and local muscular breakpoints determined from near-infrared
  spectroscopy (NIRS) and electromyography (EMG). However, these breakpoints have
  not yet been compared both in locomotor and non-locomotor muscles simultaneously
  in single-leg cycling exercise. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate
  the relationship and agreement between systemic and local breakpoints in locomotor
  and non-locomotor muscles.  Method: Data from twelve physically-active participants
  (25.5 ± 3.9 years, 176.1 ± 11.6 cm, 71.2 ± 9.4 kg, 4 females) who completed a continuous
  single-leg step incremental cycling test (10 W min-1) with their right leg were
  included in the analysis. Ventilation and gas exchange were recorded to determine
  RCP. Surface EMG (sEMG) and NIRS signals were measured from both vasti lateralis
  muscles and breakpoints were determined from root mean Q square sEMG and deoxygenated
  hemo- and myoglobin signal m[HHb].  Results: There was no significant difference
  in the power output at RCP (127.3 ± 21.8 W) and local muscular breakpoints both
  from the locomotor (m[HHb]: 119.7 ± 23.6 W, sEMG: 126.6 ± 26.0 W) and non-locomotor
  (m[HHb]: 117.5 ± 17.9 W, sEMG: 126.1 ± 28.4 W) muscles. Breakpoints also showed
  significant (p textless 0.01) correlations (r = 0.67–0.90, ICC = 0.80–0.94) to each
  other with weaker correlations in the non-locomotor muscle (r = 0.66–0.86, ICC =
  0.74–0.90). Despite the strong correlations, high individual variability and weak
  limits of agreement (up to −32.5–46.5 W) and substantial absolute differences (10.2–16.7
  W) were observed which indicates that these breakpoints cannot be used interchangeably.  Discussion:
  These findings offer further insights into the mechanistic relationship between
  local and systemic physiological response to exercise with increasing workload.
  We conclude that, despite strong correlations, local muscular breakpoints do not
  have to coincide with systemic boundaries of physiological domains.'
