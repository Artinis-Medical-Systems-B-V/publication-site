abstract: "Oxygen uptake kinetics ($\u03C4$V\u0307O2) are slowed when exercise is\
  \ initiated from a raised metabolic rate. Whether this reflects the recruitment\
  \ of muscle fibres differing in oxidative capacity, or slowed blood flow (Q\u0307\
  ) kinetics is unclear. This study determined $\u03C4$V\u0307O2 in canine muscle\
  \ in situ, with experimental control over muscle activation and Q\u0307 during contractions\
  \ initiated from rest and a raised metabolic rate. The gastrocnemius complex of\
  \ nine anaesthetised, ventilated dogs was isolated and attached to a force transducer.\
  \ Isometric tetanic contractions (50 Hz; 200 ms duration) via supramaximal sciatic\
  \ nerve stimulation were used to manipulate metabolic rate: 3 min stimulation at\
  \ 0.33 Hz (S1), followed by 3 min at 0.67 Hz (S2). Circulation was initially intact\
  \ (SPON), and subsequently isolated for pump-perfusion (PUMP) above the greatest\
  \ value in SPON. Muscle V\u0307O2 was determined contraction-by-contraction using\
  \ an ultrasonic flowmeter and venous oximeter, and normalised to tension-time integral\
  \ (TTI). $\u03C4$V\u0307O2/TTI and $\u03C4$Q\u0307 were less in S1SPON (mean \xB1\
  \ s.d.: 13 \xB1 3 s and 12 \xB1 4 s, respectively) than in S2SPON (29 \xB1 19 s\
  \ and 31 \xB1 13 s, respectively; P < 0.05). $\u03C4$V\u0307O2/TTI was unchanged\
  \ by pump-perfusion (S1PUMP, 12 \xB1 4 s; S2PUMP, 24 \xB1 6 s; P < 0.001) despite\
  \ increased O2 delivery; at S2 onset, venous O2 saturation was 21 \xB1 4% and 65\
  \ \xB1 5% in SPON and PUMP, respectively. V\u0307O2 kinetics remained slowed when\
  \ contractions were initiated from a raised metabolic rate despite uniform muscle\
  \ stimulation and increased O2 delivery. The intracellular mechanism may relate\
  \ to a falling energy state, approaching saturating ADP concentration, and/or slowed\
  \ mitochondrial activation; but further study is required. These data add to the\
  \ evidence that muscle V\u0307O2 control is more complex than previously suggested.\
