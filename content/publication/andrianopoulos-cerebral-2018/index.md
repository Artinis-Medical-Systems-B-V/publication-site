abstract: "Insufficient cerebral blood flow regulation to meet increasing metabolic\
  \ demand during physical exertion could be associated with cognitive impairment.\
  \ We compared cerebral oxygen availability during exercise in cognitively impaired\
  \ (CI) to cognitively normal (CN) COPD patients. Fifty-two patients (FEV1: 51 \xB1\
  \ 16%) were classified as CN or CI according to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment.\
  \ Patients performed cycle-ergometry at 75% peak capacity with continuous measurement\
  \ of Near-Infrared Spectroscopy frontal-cortex Tissue oxygen Saturation Index (TSI),\
  \ cerebral haemoglobin indices (oxy/deoxy/total- Hb), transcutaneous carbon-dioxide\
  \ partial pressure (TcPCO2), and arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2). Twenty-one patients\
  \ (40%) presented evidences of CI. During exercise, CN and CI patients exhibited\
  \ mild to moderate SpO2decline (nadir[$\u0394$]\u2265 \u22123 \xB1 2% and \u2212\
  5 \xB1 3%, respectively) but preserved baseline frontal-cortex TSI levels, whilst\
  \ presenting small TcPCO2 perturbations and increased cerebral total-Hb (post [$\u0394\
  $]\u2265 2.0 \xB1 3 $\u03BC$M sec\u22121). CI patients preserve the capacity to\
  \ adequately maintain cerebral oxygen availability during submaximal exercise. Therefore,\
  \ rehabilitative exercise training in CI patients with COPD exhibiting mild to moderate\
  \ exercise-induced SpO2 decline does not appear to lead to reduced cerebral oxygen\
  \ availability."
