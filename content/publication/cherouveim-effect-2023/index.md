abstract: 'This study aimed to elucidate whether muscle blood flow restriction during
  maximal exercise is associated with alterations in hemodynamics, cerebral oxygenation,
  cerebral activation, and deterioration of exercise performance in male participants.
  Thirteen healthy males, cyclists (age 33 ± 2 yrs., body mass: 78.6 ± 2.5 kg, and
  body mass index: 25.57 ± 0.91 kg·m−1), performed a maximal incremental exercise
  test on a bicycle ergometer in two experimental conditions: (a) with muscle blood
  flow restriction through the application of thigh cuffs inflated at 120 mmHg (with
  cuffs, WC) and (b) without restriction (no cuffs, NC). Exercise performance significantly
  deteriorated with muscle blood flow restriction, as evidenced by the reductions
  in V˙O2max (−17 ± 2%, p textless 0.001), peak power output (−28 ± 2%, p textless
  0.001), and time to exhaustion (−28 ± 2%, p textless 0.001). Muscle oxygenated hemoglobin
  (Δ[O2Hb]) during exercise declined more in the NC condition (p textless 0.01); however,
  at exhaustion, the magnitude of muscle oxygenation and muscle deoxygenation were
  similar between conditions (p textgreater 0.05). At maximal effort, lower cerebral
  deoxygenated hemoglobin (Δ[HHb]) and cerebral total hemoglobin (Δ[THb]) were observed
  in WC (p textless 0.001), accompanied by a lower cardiac output, heart rate, and
  stroke volume vs. the NC condition (p textless 0.01), whereas systolic blood pressure,
  rating of perceived exertion, and cerebral activation (as assessed by electroencephalography
  (EEG) activity) were similar (p textgreater 0.05) between conditions at task failure,
  despite marked differences in exercise duration, maximal aerobic power output, and
  V˙O2max. In conclusion, in trained cyclists, muscle blood flow restriction during
  an incremental cycling exercise test significantly limited exercise performance.
  Exercise intolerance with muscle blood flow restriction was mainly associated with
  attenuated cardiac responses, despite cerebral activation reaching similar maximal
  levels as without muscle blood flow restriction.'
