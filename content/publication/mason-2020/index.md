abstract: 'Dementia cognitive decline vascular cognitive impairment functional near
  infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) A B S T R A C T The commonest causes of dementia are
  Alzheimer''s disease and vascular cognitive impairment. Although these conditions
  have been viewed as distinct entities, there is increasing evidence that neurodegenerative
  and vascular pathologies interact or overlap to cause cognitive decline, and that
  at least in some cases individuals at risk of cognitive decline exhibit abnormal
  cardiovascular physiology long before emergence of disease. However, the mechanisms
  linking haemodynamic disturbances with cognitive impairment and the various pathologies
  that cause dementia are poorly understood. A sub-sample of 502 participants from
  the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) have
  participated in the first visit of a neuroscience sub-study referred to as Insight
  46, where clinical, cognitive, imaging, and lifestyle data have been collected for
  the purpose of elucidating the pathological changes preceding dementia. This paper
  outlines the cardiovascular phenotyping performed in the follow-up visit of Insight
  46, with the study participants now aged 74. In addition to standard cardiovascular
  assessments such as blood pressure measurements, echocardiography, and electrocardiography
  (ECG), functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) has been included to provide
  an assessment of cerebrovascular function. A detailed description of the fNIRS protocol
  along with preliminary results from pilot data is presented. The combination of
  lifestyle data, brain structure/ function, cognitive performance, and cardiovascular
  health obtained not only from Insight 46, but also from the whole NSHD provides
  an exciting opportunity to advance our understanding of the cardiovascular mechanisms
  underlying dementia and cognitive decline, and identify novel targets for intervention.
