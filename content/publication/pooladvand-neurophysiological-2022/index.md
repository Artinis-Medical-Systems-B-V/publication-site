abstract: Productivity demands, time pressure, and cognitively demanding construction
  tasks increase workers' arousal and stress; however, it is not clear how these factors
  may worsen risk compensation effects and lead to unanticipated hazards. This paper
  examined the extent to which limited time and increased mental load amplify the
  risk compensatory behavior of workers. Using an immersive mixed-reality environment
  to simulate an electrical construction task, this paper applied a promising neuroimaging
  approach (functional near-infrared spectroscopy- fNIRS) to study changes in individuals'
  cognitive responses and decision dynamics under normal and stressful conditions.
  The results showed that workers failed to process surrounding information due to
  limited cognitive resources, and misperceived potential risks under time pressure
  and increased mental demand. These cognitive failures then led to increased overreliance
  on safety protections and at-risk decisions, and decreased safety performance. This
  paper offers valuable insights into the potential neural mechanism driving risk-taking
  and risk compensatory behaviors and the importance of counteracting risk compensation
  bias in the construction industry.
