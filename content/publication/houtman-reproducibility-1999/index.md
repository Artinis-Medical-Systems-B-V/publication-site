abstract: "Cardiovascular stability, as affected by several diseases, may be assessed\
  \ by head-up tilt testing. Follow-up studies are essential in both evaluating interventions\
  \ and assessing progression. However, data on the reproducibility of the changes\
  \ in circulatory status and cerebral oxygenation provoked by head-up tilt testing\
  \ are fundamental to follow-up studies. The aim of this study was, therefore, to\
  \ assess the reproducibility of the alterations in stroke volume (SV), mean arterial\
  \ pressure (MAP), as well as oxygenated ([O2Hb]) and deoxygenated haemoglobin ([HHb])\
  \ concentration in cerebral tissue from supine rest (SUP) to head-up tilt (HUT).\
  \ SV was calculated by Modelflow, a pulse contour method, from the finger arterial\
  \ pressure wave measured by Portapres, the portable version of Finapres. [O2Hb]\
  \ and [HHb] were measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIPS). Ten healthy individuals\
  \ visited the laboratory on two different days. On both days, they underwent 10\
  \ min SUP followed by 10 min 70\xB0HUT twice. SV decreased, which was (in part)\
  \ compensated for by an increased heart rate, while MAP increased slightly during\
  \ HUT compared with SUP. Although [HHb] increased during HUT, no presyncope symptoms\
  \ were experienced. The circulatory variables (SV, HR and MAP) as well as [HHb]\
  \ showed an acceptably small systematic and random error as well as reproducibility\
  \ error compared with the observed difference between HUT and SUP and were similar\
  \ between and within visits. Therefore, it is concluded that MAP measured by Portapres\
  \ and SV calculated by Modelflow as well as HHb measured by NIRS seem to be reproducible\
  \ and may therefore be used in follow-up studies."
