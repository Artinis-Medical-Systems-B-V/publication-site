abstract: "We investigated the effect of hypoxic acclimatization per se, without any\
  \ concomitant influence of strenuous physical activity on muscle and cerebral oxygenation.\
  \ Eight healthy male subjects participated in a crossover-designed study. In random\
  \ order, they conducted a 10-day normoxic (CON) and a 10-day hypoxic (EXP) confinement.\
  \ Pre and post both CON and EXP confinements, subjects conducted two incremental-load\
  \ cycling exercises to exhaustion; one under normoxic, and the other under hypoxic\
  \ (FIO2=0.154) conditions. Oxygen uptake (V \u0307 O 2), ventilation (V \u0307 E),\
  \ and relative changes in regional hemoglobin oxygenation ($\u0394$([HbO2]) in the\
  \ cerebral cortex and in the serratus anterior (SA) and vastus lateralis (VL) muscles\
  \ were measured. No changes were observed in the CON confinement. Peak work rate\
  \ and V \u0307 O 2 peak were similar pre and post in the EXP confinement, whereas\
  \ V \u0307 E increased in the EXP post normoxic and hypoxic trials (P<0.05). The\
  \ exercise-induced drop in VL $\u0394$[HbO2] was less in the post- than pre-EXP\
  \ trial by 4.0\xB10.4 and 4.2\xB10.6$\u03BC$M during normoxic and hypoxic exercise,\
  \ respectively. No major changes were observed in cerebral or SA oxygenation. These\
  \ results demonstrate that a 10-day hypoxic exposure without any concomitant physical\
  \ activity had no effect on normoxic or hypoxic V \u0307 O 2 peak, despite the enhanced\
  \ VL oxygenation. \xA9 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S."
