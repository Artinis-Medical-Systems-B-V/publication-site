abstract: "Background: Habituation of postural response to perturbations is impaired\
  \ in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) due to deficits in cortico-basal pathways.\
  \ Although transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) modulate cortico-basal\
  \ networks, it remains unclear if it can benefit postural control in PD. Objective:\
  \ To analyze the effect of different intensities of anodal tDCS on postural responses\
  \ and prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity during the habituation to the external perturbation\
  \ in patients with PD (n = 24). Methods: Anodal tDCS was applied over the primary\
  \ motor cortex (M1) with 1 mA, 2 mA, and sham stimulation in 3 different sessions\
  \ ($\u223C$2 weeks apart) during 20 minutes immediately before the postural assessment.\
  \ External perturbation (7 trials) was applied by a support base posterior translation\
  \ (20 cm/s and 5 cm). Primary outcome measures included lower limb electromyography\
  \ and center of pressure parameters. Measures of PFC activity are reported as exploratory\
  \ outcomes. Analyses of variance (Stimulation Condition \xD7 Trial) were performed.\
  \ Results: Habituation of perturbation was evidenced independent of the stimulation\
  \ conditions. Both active stimulation intensities had shorter recovery time and\
  \ a trend for lower cortical activity in the stimulated hemisphere when compared\
  \ to sham condition. Shorter onset latency of the medial gastrocnemius as well as\
  \ lower cortical activity in the nonstimulated hemisphere were only observed after\
  \ 2 mA concerning the sham condition. Conclusions: tDCS over M1 improved the postural\
  \ response to external perturbation in PD, with better response observed for 2 mA\
  \ compared with 1 mA. However, tDCS seems to be inefficient in modifying the habituation\
  \ of perturbation."
