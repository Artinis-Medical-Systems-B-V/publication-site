abstract: "Introduction: Retrograde shear causes endothelial damage and is pro-atherogenic.\
  \ The purpose of our study was to examine the impact of vascular remodeling from\
  \ habitual exercise training on acute changes in retrograde shear and microvascular\
  \ oxygenation (SMO2) induced via 30\_min of external compression. Methods: Participants\
  \ included 11 exercise trained (ET) men (Division I track athletes; age 20 \xB1\
  \ 3\_years) and 18 recreationally active (RA) men (age 23 \xB1 5\_years). Near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to measure vastus medialis SMO2. Doppler-ultrasound\
  \ was used to assess SFA intima-media thickness, diameter and flow velocity to derive\
  \ retrograde shear. Vascular measures were made at baseline (BASELINE), during a\
  \ sham condition (calf compression to 5\_mmHg, SHAM) and during the experimental\
  \ condition (calf compression to 60\_mmHg, EXP). Results: Compared to RA, ET had\
  \ larger SFA diameters (0.66 \xB1 0.06 vs 0.58 \xB1 0.06\_cm, p < 0.05) and lower\
  \ SFA IMT (0.33 \xB1 0.03 vs 0.36 \xB1 0.07\_mm, p < 0.05). Retrograde shear increased\
  \ similarly in both groups during EXP (p < 0.05) but ET men had lower overall retrograde\
  \ shear during the conditions (BASELINE 75.8 \xB1 26.8 vs EXP 88.2 \xB1 16.9\_s\u2212\
  1) compared to RA men (BASELINE 84.4 \xB1 23.3 vs EXP 106.4 \xB1 19.6\_s\u22121p\
  \ < 0.05). There was a similar increase in SMO2 from BASELINE to SHAM (ET + 8.1\
  \ \xB1 4.8 vs RA + 6.4 \xB1 9.7%) and BASELINE to EXP (ET + 8.7 \xB1 6.4 vs RA +\
  \ 7.1 \xB1 9.0%) in both groups. Conclusion: Beneficial vascular remodeling in ET\
  \ men is associated with lower retrograde shear during external compression. Acute\
  \ increases in retrograde shear with external compression do not detrimentally impact\
  \ microvascular oxygenation."
