abstract: Long sleep durations (≥540 min) are associated with poor cognitive performance
  in ageing adults, but the underlying cause is unclear. The aim of this study was
  to investigate the effect of extended sleep on cognitive performance and cerebral
  vascular function before and then after aerobic exercise. In all, 12 adults completed
  6 nights of 8- (control) and 10+-h (sleep extension) time in bed in a randomised,
  crossover experiment. Sleep was measured using wrist actigraphy. On the last day
  of each time in bed protocol, participants performed three bouts of brisk walking.
  Sustained attention, spatial rotation ability, mental flexibility, and working memory
  were assessed, while prefrontal oxygen saturation index (ΔTSI) was measured using
  near-infrared spectroscopy. A two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (time
  in bed × before/after exercise) was used for statistical analysis. Average sleep
  duration was longer following sleep extension as compared to control, at a mean
  (SD) of 551 (16) versus 428 (20) min (p textless 0.001). Sleep extension did not
  alter cognitive performance as compared to control, but increased ΔTSI during tests
  of spatial rotation ability (main effect for time in bed, p = 0.03), mental flexibility
  (p = 0.04), and working memory (p textless 0.01). Cognitive performance was improved
  (main effect for exercise, p textless 0.05) following brisk walking for all cognitive
  domains except sustained attention with no interaction with time in bed. In summary,
  6 nights of extended time in bed accompanied by long sleep durations does not impair
  cognitive performance at rest or alter the positive effect of acute aerobic exercise
  on cognition but may increase frontal cerebral oxygenation during cognitive functioning.
