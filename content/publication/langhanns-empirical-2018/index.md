abstract: Motor-cognitive dual tasks have been intensely studied and it has been demonstrated
  that even well practiced movements like walking show signs of interference when
  performed concurrently with a challenging cognitive task. Typically walking speed
  is reduced, at least in elderly persons. In contrast to these findings, some authors
  report an increased movement frequency under dual-task conditions, which they call
  hastening. A tentative explanation has been proposed, assuming that the respective
  movements are governed by an automatic control regime. Though, under single-task
  conditions, these automatic processes are supervised by "higher-order" cognitive
  control processes. However, when a concurrent cognitive task binds all cognitive
  resources, the automatic process is freed from the detrimental effect of cognitive
  surveillance, allowing higher movement frequencies. Fast rhythmic movements (> 1
  Hz) should more likely be governed by such an automatic process than low frequency
  discrete repetitive movements. Fifteen subjects performed two repetitive movements
  under single and dual-task condition, that is, in combination with a mental calculation
  task. According to the expectations derived from the explanatory concept, we found
  an increased movement frequency under dual-task conditions only for the fast rhythmic
  movement (paddleball task) but not for the slower discrete repetitive task (pegboard
  task). fNIRS measurements of prefrontal cortical load confirmed the idea of an automatic
  processing in the paddleball task, whereas the pegboard task seems to be more controlled
  by processes interfering with the calculation related processing.
