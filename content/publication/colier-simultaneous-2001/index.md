abstract: "In this study we have shown that in humans it is possible to monitor non-invasively\
  \ and simultaneously both hemispheres revealing cortical oxygenation changes in\
  \ the occipital area in response to a contra-lateral hemi-field paradigm. A novel\
  \ multi-channel near infrared spectroscopy approach with a high temporal resolution\
  \ was used. The results confirm previous findings obtained by functional magnetic\
  \ resonance imaging and positron emission tomography with the advantage to measure\
  \ directly not only concentration changes in deoxyhemoglobin as measured by functional\
  \ magenetic resonance imaging (MRI), but also in oxyhemoglobin with low cost instrumentation\
  \ potentially useful to investigate the pathophysiology of vision. \xA9 2000 Elsevier\
