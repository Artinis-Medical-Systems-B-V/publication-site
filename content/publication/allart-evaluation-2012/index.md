abstract: "Several authors have reported alterations in vasodilation during effort\
  \ in patients with dystrophinopathies, in which a lack of neuronal NO synthase is\
  \ thought to lead to functional muscle ischemia. In order to determine changes in\
  \ muscle oxygenation during effort in patients with Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD)\
  \ and assess the parameters' links with disease severity and functional status,\
  \ 10 BMD patients and 10 age-matched controls performed isokinetic, constant-load\
  \ knee extension exercises at (i) 20% of their extensors' peak torque (i.e. the\
  \ same relative load) and (ii) the same absolute load (20. Nm). Muscle oxygenation\
  \ was evaluated noninvasively using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), with the\
  \ time course of deoxygenation as the main criterion. As expected, BMD patients\
  \ displayed a lower peak torque than controls (-62%). During both types of exercise,\
  \ initial muscle deoxygenation was faster (by 27-41%) in BMD patients than in controls.\
  \ Greater disease severity (according to the Motor Function Measure) and functional\
  \ impairment (walking endurance) were associated with a faster second deoxygenation\
  \ phase (. $\u03C4$). The validity and relevance of muscle deoxygenation parameters\
  \ and the alteration of vasodilatation by nNOS deficiency in dystrophinopathies\
  \ should be assessed by further studies. \xA9 2012 Elsevier B.V."
