abstract: "Purpose Small sided games (SSG) of football are an effective and efficient\
  \ format to simultaneously train the physiological, technical, and tactical components\
  \ of football. The duration of the recovery period between bouts of SSG will affect\
  \ the physiological response to subsequent bouts. It was hypothesised that decreasing\
  \ the duration of recovery periods separating serial SSG bouts would increase physiological,\
  \ and perceptual responses, and decrease high speed running, and distance during\
  \ SSG bouts. Methods Twelve experienced footballers (mean \xB1 SD; age 21 \xB1 3\
  \ yrs; VO2peak 64 \xB17ml\u02D9min\u02D9kg-1; playing experience 15 \xB1 3 yrs)\
  \ completed two SSG sessions. Each SSG consisted of 3 vs. 3 players and 6 bouts\
  \ of 2 min duration, with bouts separated by either 30 s recovery (REC- 30) or 120\
  \ s recovery (REC-120). Deoxygenated haemoglobin (HHb) in the vastus lateralis (VL)\
  \ (using near infrared spectroscopy), heart rate (HR) and time motion descriptors\
  \ (TMD) (speed and distance) were measured continuously during the SSG sessions\
  \ and perceived exertion (RPE) was measured for each bout. Results During the recovery\
  \ periods, in REC-30 compared to REC-120, there was a significant (p < 0.05) main\
  \ effect of a higher HHb and HR. During the bouts, in REC-30 compared to REC- 120,\
  \ there were no significant differences in HHb, HR, RPE, or TMD, but within both\
  \ REC- 30 and REC-120 there were significant increases as a function of bout number\
  \ in RPE. Conclusions Although a four-fold increase in recovery period allowed a\
  \ significant increase in the recovery of HHb and HR, this did not increase the\
  \ physiological, and perceptual responses, or time motion descriptors during the\
  \ bouts. These results could have been due to the regulation of effort (pacing),\
  \ in these experienced players performing an exercise task to which they were well\
  \ adapted."
