abstract: Congenital myopathies (CM) are a group of rare hereditary muscle diseases
  defined by characteristic abnormalities on muscle biopsy. The most prominent clinical
  features are generalized muscle weakness often pronounced axially, variable cardiorespiratory
  and bulbar impairment, and skeletal and joint involvement. Currently, no curative
  therapies are available for CMs, however, a few phase I-II trials have been performed
  or are expected in the near future. To reach trial readiness, an informed understanding
  of the disease course and a selection of relevant and sensitive patient-reported
  outcomes, clinical and functional outcome measures, and blood and imaging biomarkers
  is necessary. In collaboration with patient representatives, a natural history study
  has been designed. We are performing a prospective, longitudinal cohort study with
  five 6 monthly visits over a 2-year-period in patients with Centronuclear myopathy,
  Core myopathy, and Nemaline myopathy at the Radboudumc in the Netherlands. 45 patients
  aged ≥2 years old will be included. At each visit, the participants will undergo
  several measurements; neurological exam, functional tests, hand-held dynamometry,
  pulmonary function tests, and receive questionnaires. At the first and last visit,
  they will also undergo muscle imaging; muscle ultrasound bilaterally, muscle MRI
  of the lower extremities bilaterally, and a Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan.
  The study is ongoing and the baseline measurements will have been performed at the
  end of spring 2025. This study will provide important natural history data of CM
  patients. Preliminary results of the baseline measurements will be presented at
  the conference.
