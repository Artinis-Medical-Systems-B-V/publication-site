abstract: Objectives Aerobic exercise training can increase skeletal muscle mitochondrial
  content. Supine exercise training with legs above the heart potentially augments
  these increases. However, the impact of supine exercise training on mitochondrial
  biogenesis and cardiovascular adaptations remains unclear. Methods In this single-centred,
  randomized, parallel arm trial, 19 recreationally active individuals underwent seven
  sessions of either supine with legs up (SUP; n=9, 6 females) or upright with legs
  down (UP; n=10, 7 females) aerobic training on a recumbent bike at 71 ± 7 % and
  71 ± 2 % of peak work rate (WRpeak), respectively. The study aimed to test the effects
  of training with decreased muscle oxygenation on indices of muscle mitochondrial
  remodelling. Secondary outcomes included exercise performance, muscle oxygenation,
  and cardiovascular responses. Results Secondary outcomes revealed significant interaction
  effects for time to fatigue (TTF) and WRpeak in the SUP group during supine testing,
  suggesting enhanced exercise tolerance and performance. No between group interaction
  effects were observed for upright testing. No clear effects on mitochondrial biogenesis
  were observed based on expression of mitochondrial protein subunits and transcriptional
  regulators. Acutely, HRpeak was lower during the SUP Test compared to the UP Test.
  No central cardiovascular adaptations were observed following training. Conclusions
  Our exploratory analyses showed that supine aerobic training more effectively improves
  supine exercise tolerance and performance compared with upright training, despite
  no differences in measured proteins related to mitochondrial biogenesis. Further
  research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these postural-specific
  training effects.
