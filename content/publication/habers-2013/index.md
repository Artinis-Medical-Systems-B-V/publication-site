abstract: "Introduction: We hypothesized that microvascular disturbances in muscle\
  \ tissue play a role in the reduced exercise capacity in juvenile dermatomyositis\
  \ (JDM). Methods: Children with JDM, children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis\
  \ (clinical controls), and healthy children performed a maximal incremental cycloergometric\
  \ test from which normalized concentration changes in oxygenated hemoglobin ($\u0394\
  $[O2Hb]) and total hemoglobin ($\u0394$[tHb]) as well as the half-recovery times\
  \ of both signals were determined from the vastus medialis and vastus lateralis\
  \ muscles using near-infrared spectroscopy. Results: Children with JDM had lower\
  \ $\u0394$[tHb] values in the vastus medialis at work rates of 25%, 50%, 75%, and\
  \ 100% of maximal compared with healthy children; the increase in $\u0394$[tHb]\
  \ with increasing intensity seen in healthy children was absent in children with\
  \ JDM. Other outcome measures did not differ by group. Conclusions: The results\
  \ suggest that children with JDM may experience difficulties in increasing muscle\
  \ blood volume with more strenuous exercise. \xA9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
