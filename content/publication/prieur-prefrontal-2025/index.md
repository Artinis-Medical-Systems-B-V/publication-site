abstract: 'Objectives: To investigate prefrontal cortex activation during single-
  and dual-task treadmill exercises at an imposed speed and a speed selected by patients
  with Parkinson''s disease (PD). Methods: Eleven patients with PD (Hoehn and Yahr''s
  stages I–II) and 11 matched healthy controls (HC) performed six 2-minute tasks on
  a treadmill: two static cognitive tasks, two single-task walking tests and two dual-task
  walking tests, with each walking test being performed at an imposed and at a self-selected
  speed. The hemodynamics in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) were measured continuously
  using functional near-infrared spectroscopy to evaluate cortical activation. The
  perceived difficulty of the task, cognitive performance and gait parameters were
  also assessed. Results: For the walking tasks, the HCs activated their PFC during
  dual-tasks (P textless 0.01) but not when carrying out single-tasks, unlike PD patients
  who activated their PFC at a similar level for both the single-task and dual-task
  at an imposed speed (P textless 0.05); no activation occurred at a self-selected
  speed. Perceived difficulty of the task was significantly greater among PD patients
  than among HCs (P textless 0.05) and while executing dual-task more than single-tasks
  (P textless 0.001). Variability in the pace was higher among PD patients than among
  HCs (P textless 0.01). Conclusion: Imposing a walking speed on a treadmill for PD
  patients with mild disease severity increases their PFC activity. However, PD patients
  were unable to further boost PFC activity when a cognitive task was added to the
  imposed walking speed.'
