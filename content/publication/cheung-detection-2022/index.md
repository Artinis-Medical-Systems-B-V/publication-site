abstract: 'Significance: Pulse oximetry is widely used in clinical practice to monitor
  changes in arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2). However, decreases in SpO2 can be
  delayed relative to the actual clinical event, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)
  may detect alterations in oxygenation earlier than pulse oximetry, as shown in previous
  cerebral oxygenation monitoring studies.  Aim: We aim to compare the response of
  transcutaneous muscle NIRS measures of the tissue saturation index with pulse oximetry
  SpO2 during hypoxia.  Approach: Episodes of acute hypoxia were induced in nine anesthetized
  Yucatan miniature pigs. A standard pulse oximeter was attached to the ear of the
  animal, and a transcutaneous NIRS sensor was placed on the hind limb muscle. Hypoxia
  was induced by detaching the ventilator from the animal and reattaching it once
  the pulse oximeter reported 70% SpO2.  Results: Twenty-four episodes of acute hypoxia
  were analyzed. Upon the start of hypoxia, the transcutaneous NIRS measures changed
  in 5.3 ± 0.4 s, whereas the pulse oximetry measures changed in 14.9 ± 1.0 s (p textless
  0.0001).  Conclusions: Transcutaneous muscle NIRS can detect the effects of hypoxia
  significantly sooner than pulse oximetry in the Yucatan miniature pig. A transcutaneous
  NIRS sensor may be used as an earlier detector of oxygen saturation changes in the
  clinical setting than the standard pulse oximeter.'
