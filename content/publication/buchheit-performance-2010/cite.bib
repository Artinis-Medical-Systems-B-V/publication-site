 abstract = {In this study, the performance and selected physiological responses to team-sport specific repeated-sprint and jump sequence were investigated. On four occasions, 13 team-sport players (22 ± 3 year) performed alternatively six repeated maximal straight-line or shuttle-sprints interspersed with a jump ([RS+j, 6 × 25 m] or [RSS+j, 6 × (2 × 12.5 m)]) or not ([RS, 6 × 25 m] or [RSS, 6 × (2 × 12.5 m)]) within each recovery period. Mean running time, rate of perceived exertion (RPE), pulmonary oxygen uptake ( $$ \dotV $$ O2), blood lactate ([La]b), and vastus lateralis deoxygenation ([HHb]) were obtained for each condition. Mean sprint times were greater for RS+j versus RS (4.14 ± 0.17 vs. 4.09 ± 0.16 s, with the qualitative analysis revealing a 82% chance of RS+j times to be greater than RS) and for RSS+j versus RSS (5.43 ± 0.18 vs. 5.29 ± 0.17 s; 99% chance of RSS+j to be >RSS). The correlation between sprint and jump abilities were large-to-very-large, but below 0.71 for RSSs. Jumps increased RPE (Cohen's d ± 90% CL: +0.7 ± 0.5; 95% chance for RS+j > RS and +0.7 ± 0.5; 96% for RSS+j > RSS), $$ \dotV $$ O 2 (+0.4 ± 0.5; 80% for RS+j > RS and +0.5 ± 0.5; 86% for RSS+j > RSS), [La]b (+0.5 ± 0.5; 59% for RS+j > RS and +0.2 ± 0.5; unclear for RSS+j > RSS), and [HHb] (+0.5 ± 0.5; 86% for RS +j > RS and +0.5 ± 0.5; 85% for RSS+j > RSS). To conclude, repeated-sprint and jump abilities could be considered as specific qualities. The addition of a jump within the recovery periods during repeated-sprint running sequences impairs sprinting performance and might be an effective training practice for eliciting both greater systemic and vastus lateralis physiological loads. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},
