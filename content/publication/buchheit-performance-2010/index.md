abstract: "In this study, the performance and selected physiological responses to\
  \ team-sport specific repeated-sprint and jump sequence were investigated. On four\
  \ occasions, 13 team-sport players (22 \xB1 3 year) performed alternatively six\
  \ repeated maximal straight-line or shuttle-sprints interspersed with a jump ([RS+j,\
  \ 6 \xD7 25 m] or [RSS+j, 6 \xD7 (2 \xD7 12.5 m)]) or not ([RS, 6 \xD7 25 m] or\
  \ [RSS, 6 \xD7 (2 \xD7 12.5 m)]) within each recovery period. Mean running time,\
  \ rate of perceived exertion (RPE), pulmonary oxygen uptake ( $$ dotV $$ O2), blood\
  \ lactate ([La]b), and vastus lateralis deoxygenation ([HHb]) were obtained for\
  \ each condition. Mean sprint times were greater for RS+j versus RS (4.14 \xB1 0.17\
  \ vs. 4.09 \xB1 0.16 s, with the qualitative analysis revealing a 82% chance of\
  \ RS+j times to be greater than RS) and for RSS+j versus RSS (5.43 \xB1 0.18 vs.\
  \ 5.29 \xB1 0.17 s; 99% chance of RSS+j to be >RSS). The correlation between sprint\
  \ and jump abilities were large-to-very-large, but below 0.71 for RSSs. Jumps increased\
  \ RPE (Cohen's d \xB1 90% CL: +0.7 \xB1 0.5; 95% chance for RS+j > RS and +0.7 \xB1\
  \ 0.5; 96% for RSS+j > RSS), $$ dotV $$ O 2 (+0.4 \xB1 0.5; 80% for RS+j > RS and\
  \ +0.5 \xB1 0.5; 86% for RSS+j > RSS), [La]b (+0.5 \xB1 0.5; 59% for RS+j > RS and\
  \ +0.2 \xB1 0.5; unclear for RSS+j > RSS), and [HHb] (+0.5 \xB1 0.5; 86% for RS\
  \ +j > RS and +0.5 \xB1 0.5; 85% for RSS+j > RSS). To conclude, repeated-sprint\
  \ and jump abilities could be considered as specific qualities. The addition of\
  \ a jump within the recovery periods during repeated-sprint running sequences impairs\
  \ sprinting performance and might be an effective training practice for eliciting\
  \ both greater systemic and vastus lateralis physiological loads. \xA9 2010 Springer-Verlag."
