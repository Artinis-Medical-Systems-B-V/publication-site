abstract: Objective This study investigates the mechanisms behind exercise capacity
  in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), focusing on central and peripheral
  components, as described by the Fick equation. Methods A cross-sectional study of
  141 adults with T2DM was conducted, using cardiopulmonary exercise testing, near-infrared
  spectroscopy (NIRS) and exercise echocardiography. Participants with sufficient-quality
  NIRS data were stratified into tertiles based on percentage predicted VO₂peak. Group
  comparisons and stepwise regression were used to examine the contributions of central
  and peripheral components to VO₂peak. Results Sixty-seven participants had insufficient
  quality NIRS data. Those with lower-quality data were more likely to be female (p textless 0.001)
  and had a lower exercise capacity (p textless 0.001). Among participants with good-quality
  NIRS data, those in the lowest fitness tertile were older (p textless 0.01), had
  a longer diabetes duration (p = 0.04), lower eGFR (p textless 0.001) and more frequent
  use of beta-blockers (p = 0.02) and diuretics (p = 0.04). Significant differences
  were observed in peak cardiac output (p textless 0.001) and NIRS-derived parameters
  across fitness groups. Multivariate regression identified cardiac output as the
  strongest predictor of VO₂peak, while peripheral oxygen extraction did not improve
  model performance. Conclusion Cardiac output is the primary determinant of exercise
  capacity in adults with T2DM. This suggests that muscle perfusion may be the main
  limiting factor in relatively fit individuals with T2DM. However, cardiac output
  and local muscle perfusion are not directly equivalent, as mechanical factors, such
  as intramuscular pressure during high-intensity exercise, may prevent maximal perfusion.
