abstract: "The ergogenic effect of beetroot on the exercise performance of trained\
  \ cyclists, runners, kayakers, and swimmers has been demonstrated. However, whether\
  \ or not beetroot supplementation presents a beneficial effect on the exercise performance\
  \ of jiu-jitsu athletes remains inconclusive. Therefore, the present study assessed\
  \ the effect of beetroot-based gel (BG) supplementation on maximal voluntary contraction\
  \ (MVC), exercise time until fatigue (ETF), muscle O2 saturation (Sm O2), blood\
  \ volume (tHb), and plasma nitrate and lactate in response to handgrip isotonic\
  \ exercise (HIE) in jiu-jitsu athletes. In a randomized, crossover, double-blind\
  \ design, 12 jiu-jitsu athletes performed 3 sets of HIE at 40% of the MVC until\
  \ fatigue after 8 days (the eighth dose was offered 120 min previous exercise) of\
  \ BG supplementation or a nitrate-depleted gel (PLA), and forearm Sm O2 and tHb\
  \ were continuously monitored by using near-infrared spectroscopy. Blood samples\
  \ were taken before, immediately after exercise, and 20 min after exercise recovery\
  \ in the PLA and BG conditions. MVC was evaluated at baseline and 20 min after HIE.\
  \ There was a significant reduction in $\u0394$MVC decline after HIE in the BG condition.\
  \ Forearm Sm O2 during exercise recovery was significantly greater only after BG\
  \ supplementation. No significant difference in ETF and tHb were observed between\
  \ both BG and PLA in response to HIE. Plasma nitrate increased only after BG, whereas\
  \ the exercise-induced increase in plasma lactate was significantly lower in BG\
  \ when compared with PLA. In conclusion, BG supplementation may be a good nutritional\
  \ strategy to improve forearm Sm O2 and prevent force decline in response to exercise\
  \ in jiu-jitsu athletes."
