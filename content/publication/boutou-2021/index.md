abstract: "Background: The integrative physiological effects of O2 treatment on patients\
  \ with pulmonary hypertension (PH) during exercise, have not been fully investigated.\
  \ We simultaneously evaluated, for the first time, the effect of oxygen supplementation\
  \ on hemodynamic responses, autonomic modulation, tissue oxygenation, and exercise\
  \ performance in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)/Chronic Thromboembolic\
  \ PH(CTEPH). Material-methods: In this randomized, cross-over, placebo-controlled\
  \ trial, stable outpatients with PAH/CTEPH underwent maximal cardiopulmonary exercise\
  \ testing, followed by two submaximal trials, during which they received supplementary\
  \ oxygen (O2) or medical-air. Continuous, non-invasive hemodynamics were monitored\
  \ via photophlythesmography. Cerebral and quadriceps muscle oxygenation were recorded\
  \ via near-infrared spectroscopy. Autonomic function was assessed by heart rate\
  \ variability; root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) and standard-deviation-Poincare-plot\
  \ (SD1) were used as indices of parasympathetic output. Baroreceptor sensitivity\
  \ (BRS) was assessed throughout the protocols. Results: Nine patients (51.4 \xB1\
  \ 9.4 years) were included. With O2-supplementation patients exercised for longer\
  \ (p = 0.01), maintained higher cerebral oxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb;p = 0.02) levels,\
  \ exhibited an amelioration in cortical deoxygenation (HHb;p = 0.02), and had higher\
  \ average cardiac output (CO) during exercise (p < 0.05), compared to medical air;\
  \ with no differences in muscle oxygenation. With O2-supplementation patients exhibited\
  \ higher BRS and sample-entropy throughout the protocol (p < 0.05) vs. medical air,\
  \ and improved the blunted RMSSD, SD1 responses during exercise (p = 0.024). Conclusion:\
  \ We show that O2 administration improves BRS and autonomic function during submaximal\
  \ exercise in PAH/CTEPH, without significantly affecting muscle oxygenation. The\
  \ improved autonomic function, along with enhancements in cardiovascular function\
  \ and cerebral oxygenation, probably contributes to increased exercise tolerance\
  \ with O2-supplementation in PH patients."
