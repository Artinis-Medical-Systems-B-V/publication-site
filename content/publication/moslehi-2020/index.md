abstract: The purpose of this study was to discriminate between left- and right-hand
  motor imagery tasks. We recorded the brain signals from two participants using a
  fNIRS system and compared different feature extraction (mean, peak, minimum, skewness
  and kurtosis) and classification techniques (linear (LDA) and quadratic discriminant
  analysis (QDA), support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression, K-nearest-neighbor
  (KNN), and neural networks with Levenberg-Marquardt (LMA), Bayesian Regularization
  (BRANN) and Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCGA) training algorithms). The results showed
  poor classification accuracies (<58%) when skewness and kurtosis were used. When
  mean, peak, and minimum were used as features, QDA, SVM and KNN produced higher
  classification accuracies relative to LDA and logistic regression. Overall, BRANN
  led to the highest accuracies (>98%) when mean, peak and minimum were used as features.
