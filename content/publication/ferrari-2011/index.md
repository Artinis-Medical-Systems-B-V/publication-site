abstract: "This article provides a snapshot of muscle near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)\
  \ at the end of 2010 summarizing the recent literature, offering the present status\
  \ and perspectives of the NIRS instrumentation and methods, describing the main\
  \ NIRS studies on skeletal muscle physiology, posing open questions and outlining\
  \ future directions. So far, different NIRS techniques (e.g. continuous-wave (CW)\
  \ and spatially, time- and frequency-resolved spectroscopy) have been used for measuring\
  \ muscle oxygenation during exercise. In the last four years, approximately 160\
  \ muscle NIRS articles have been published on different physiological aspects (primarily\
  \ muscle oxygenation and haemodynamics) of several upper- and lower-limb muscle\
  \ groups investigated by using mainly two-channel CW and spatially resolved spectroscopy\
  \ commercial instruments. Unfortunately, in only 15 of these studies were the advantages\
  \ of using multi-channel instruments exploited. There are still several open questions\
  \ in the application of NIRS in muscle studies: (i) whether NIRS can be used in\
  \ subjects with a large fat layer; (ii) the contribution of myoglobin desaturation\
  \ to the NIRS signal during exercise; (iii) the effect of scattering changes during\
  \ exercise; and (iv) the effect of changes in skin perfusion, particularly during\
  \ prolonged exercise. Recommendations for instrumentation advancements and future\
  \ muscle NIRS studies are provided. This journal is \xA9 2011 The Royal Society."
