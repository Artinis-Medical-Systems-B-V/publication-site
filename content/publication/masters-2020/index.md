abstract: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has been used with moderate
  success in many passive brain-computer interface applications. Much of this recent
  work has been focused on differentiating between various states shortly following
  discrete stimuli. We aim to extend these results to the to the assessment of an
  operator's mental state during the complex environment encountered by helicopter
  pilots. This work presents initial efforts made in this direction. Stepping though
  phases of increasing complexity, fNIRS data from the pre-frontal cortex were collected
  and analyzed from four participants as they completed n-back tests, discrete flight
  simulator tasks, and during abbreviated simulated medevac mission scenarios. Data
  collected during the n-back tests and discrete simulator tasks were found not to
  be significantly clustered in the feature space considered. A support vector machine
  (SVM) classifier was trained on the n-back data to differentiate between workload
  levels and applied to the discrete simulator task data achieving an average 3-class
  classification accuracy of 57% and an average 2-class classification accuracy of
  68%. Finally, this classifier was applied to the data collected during the simulated
  mission and the result was found to be only weakly correlated with the participant's
  subjectively-Assessed workload. Due to these results, it is not yet clear how an
  n-back-Trained classifier could be utilized to augment an adaptive crew support
  system. We suggest that the levels of 'workload' measured by an n-back test should
  not be expected to 'map onto' other, more complex, subjective evaluations of 'workload.'
  Strong hemodynamic responses observed during mission execution however, suggest
  fNIRS may contain data relevant for the augmentation of an adaptive assistant system.
