abstract: "Purpose: A self-paced maximal exercise protocol has demonstrated higher\
  \ V\u02D9 O 2 max values when compared against traditional tests. The aim was to\
  \ compare physiological responses to this self-paced V\u02D9 O 2 max protocol (SPV)\
  \ in comparison to a traditional ramp V\u02D9 O 2 max (RAMP) protocol in young (18\u2013\
  30\_years) and old (50\u201375\_years) participants. Methods: Forty-four participants\
  \ (22 young; 22 old) completed both protocols in a randomised, counter-balanced,\
  \ crossover design. The SPV included 5\_\xD7\_2\_min stages, participants were able\
  \ to self-regulate their power output (PO) by using incremental \u2018clamps' in\
  \ ratings of perceived exertion. The RAMP consisted of either 15 or 20\_W\_min\u2212\
  1. Results: Expired gases, cardiac output (Q), stroke volume (SV), muscular deoxyhaemoglobin\
  \ (deoxyHb) and electromyography (EMG) at the vastus lateralis were recorded throughout.\
  \ Results demonstrated significantly higher V\u02D9 O 2 max in the SPV (49.68\_\xB1\
  \_10.26\_ml\_kg\u22121\_min\u22121) vs. the RAMP (47.70\_\xB1\_9.98\_ml\_kg\u2212\
  1\_min\u22121) in the young, but not in the old group (>0.05). Q and SV were significantly\
  \ higher in the SPV vs. the RAMP in the young (<0.05) but not in the old group (>0.05).\
  \ No differences seen in deoxyHb and EMG for either age groups (>0.05). Peak PO\
  \ was significantly higher in the SPV vs. the RAMP in both age groups (<0.05). Conclusion:\
  \ Findings demonstrate that the SPV produces higher V\u02D9 O 2 max, peak Q and\
  \ SV values in the young group. However, older participants achieved similar V\u02D9\
  \ O 2 max values in both protocols, mostly likely due to age-related differences\
  \ in cardiovascular responses to incremental exercise, despite them achieving a\
  \ higher physiological workload in the SPV."
