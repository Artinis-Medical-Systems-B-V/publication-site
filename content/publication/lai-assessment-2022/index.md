abstract: Purpose Muscle biopsies are the gold standard to assess mitochondrial respiration;
  however, biopsies are not always a feasible approach in persons with spinal cord
  injury (SCI). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and near-infrared spectroscopy
  (NIRS) may alternatively be predictive of mitochondrial respiration. The purpose
  of the study was to evaluate whether mitochondrial respiration of PBMCs and NIRS
  are predictive of respiration of permeabilized muscle fibers after SCI.   Methods
  Twenty-two individuals with chronic complete and incomplete motor SCI between 18â€“65
  years old were recruited to participate in the current trial. Using high-resolution
  respirometry, mitochondrial respiratory capacity was measured for PBMCs and muscle
  fibers of the vastus lateralis oxidizing complex I, II, and IV substrates. NIRS
  was used to assess mitochondrial capacity of the vastus lateralis with serial cuff
  occlusions and electrical stimulation.   Results  Positive relationships were observed
  between PBMC and permeabilized muscle fibers for mitochondrial complex IV (r = 0.86,
  P textless 0.0001). Bland-Altman displayed agreement for complex IV (MD = 0.18,
  LOA = -0.86 to 1.21), between PBMCs and permeabilized muscles fibers. No significant
  relationships were observed between NIRS mitochondrial capacity and respiration
  in permeabilized muscle fibers.    Conclusions This is the first study to explore
  and support the agreement of less invasive clinical techniques for assessing mitochondrial
  respiratory capacity in individuals with SCI. The findings will assist in the application
  of PBMCs as a viable alternative for assessing mitochondrial health in persons with
  SCI in future clinical studies.
