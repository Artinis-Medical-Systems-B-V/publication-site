abstract: Abstract  Context Type 1 diabetes (T1D) negatively affects both the endothelin
  system and muscle oxidative capacity. The endothelin pathway is a critical regulator
  of microcirculatory function and may exhibit sexual dichotomy by which healthy premenopausal
  women have greater endothelin-B receptor (ETBR) function compared to men. Moreover,
  T1D may differentially alter muscle oxidative capacity in men and women; however,
  whether ETBR function is impaired in women compared to men with T1D and its relationship
  with muscle oxidative capacity has yet to be explored.   Objective The purpose of
  this investigation was to determine if ETBR-mediated dilation is impaired in women
  compared to men with T1D and if this is related to their skeletal muscle oxidative
  capacity.   Methods Men (n = 9; glycated hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] = 7.8 ± 1.0%) and
  women (N = 10 women; HbA1c = 8.4 ± 1.3%) with uncomplicated T1D were recruited for
  this investigation. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and intradermal microdialysis
  (750 nM BQ-123 + ET-1 [10−20–10−8 mol/L]) were used to evaluate skeletal muscle
  oxidative capacity and assess ETBR-mediated vasodilation, respectively.   Results
  Skeletal muscle oxidative capacity was significantly lower (P = .031) in women compared
  with men with T1D. However, ETBR-mediated dilation induced a significantly greater
  (P = .012) vasodilatory response in women compared to men with T1D, and the area
  under the curve was negatively associated with skeletal muscle oxidative capacity
  (r = −.620; P = .042).   Conclusion Compared to men with uncomplicated T1D, muscle
  oxidative capacity was lower and ETBR-mediated vasodilation was higher in women
  with uncomplicated T1D. ETBR-induced vasodilatory capacity was inversely related
  to skeletal muscle oxidative capacity, suggesting there may be compensatory mechanisms
  occurring to preserve microvascular blood flow in women with T1D.
