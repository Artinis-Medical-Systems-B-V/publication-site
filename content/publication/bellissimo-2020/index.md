abstract: "Background: Yoga breathing has shown to impose significant cardiovascular\
  \ and psychological health benefits. Objective: The mechanism (s) responsible for\
  \ these health benefits remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to assess\
  \ the differences in cerebral and central hemodynamic responses following fast breathing\
  \ (FB) and slow breathing (SB) protocols compared to breathing awareness (BA) as\
  \ a control. Methods: Twenty healthy participants (10 males and 10 females) volunteered\
  \ to take part in the study. Participants were between ages 18\u201355 years (group\
  \ mean: 24 \xB1 5 years), with a height of 168.7 \xB1 9.8 cm and a weight of 70.16\
  \ \xB1 10.9 kg. A familiarization trial including FB and SB protocols were performed\
  \ by each participant at least 24 h before the testing day. The breathing protocols\
  \ were designed to achieve 6 breath/min for SB and $\u223C$ 120 breaths/min for\
  \ FB. Results: FB resulted in an increase in both right prefrontal cortex (RPFC)\
  \ and left prefrontal cortex (LPFC) hemoglobin difference (Hbdiff) (brain oxygenation)\
  \ compared to BA (P P P Conclusion: FB may be an effective yoga breathing technique\
  \ for eliciting cerebral brain oxygenation indicated by increased Hbdiff. These\
  \ results may be applicable to both healthy and clinical populations."
