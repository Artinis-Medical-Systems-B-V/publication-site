abstract: "Caffeine has been shown to modulate cerebral blood flow, with little evidence\
  \ of tolerance to these effects following habitual use. However, previous studies\
  \ have focused on caffeine levels much higher than those found in dietary servings\
  \ and have compared high caffeine consumers with low consumers rather than \u0149\
  on-consumers'. The current placebo-controlled double-blind, balanced-crossover study\
  \ employed near infrared spectroscopy to monitor pre-frontal cerebral-haemodynamics\
  \ at rest and during completion of tasks that activate the pre-frontal cortex. Twenty\
  \ healthy young habitual and non-habitual consumers of caffeine received 75. mg\
  \ caffeine or placebo. Caffeine significantly decreased cerebral blood flow but\
  \ this was subject to a significant interaction with consumption status, with no\
  \ significant effect being shown in habitual consumers and an exaggerated effect\
  \ in non-habitual consumers. These findings suggest that caffeine, at levels typically\
  \ found in a single dietary serving, is able to modulate cerebral blood flow but\
  \ these effects are subject to tolerance. \xA9 2011 Elsevier B.V."
