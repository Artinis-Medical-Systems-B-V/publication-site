abstract: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder, and continuous
  positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the most effective treatment. Poor adherence
  is one of the major challenges in CPAP therapy. The recent boom of wearable optical
  sensors measuring oxygen saturation makes at-home multiple-night CPAP titrations
  possible, which may essentially improve the adherence of CPAP therapy by optimizing
  its pressure in a real-life setting economically. We tested whether the oxygen desaturations
  (ODs) measured in the arm muscle (arm_OD) by gold-standard frequency-domain multi-distance
  near-infrared spectroscopy (FDMD-NIRS) change quantitatively with titrated CPAP
  pressures in OSA patients together with polysomnography. We found that the arm_OD
  (2.08 ± 1.23%, mean ± standard deviation) was significantly smaller (p-value textless
  0.0001) than the fingertip OD (finger_OD) (4.46 ± 2.37%) measured by a polysomnography
  pulse oximeter. Linear mixed-effects models suggested that CPAP pressure was a significant
  predictor for finger_OD but not for arm_OD. Since FDMD-NIRS measures a mixture of
  arterial and venous OD, whereas a fingertip pulse oximeter measures arterial OD,
  our results of no association between arm_OD and finger_OD indicate that the arm_OD
  mainly represented venous desaturation. Arm_OD measured by optical sensors used
  for wearables may not be a suitable indicator of the CPAP titration effectiveness.
