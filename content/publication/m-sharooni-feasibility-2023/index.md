abstract: Background Many studies have shown some relationships between thermal perception
  (including thermal sensation and thermal comfort) and human physiological parameters,
  such as brain signals. However, further research is still needed on how these parameters
  can help recognize the state of a human’s personal thermal perception.  Objective
  This study aims to investigate the potential of using fNIRS brain signals to evaluate
  and predict personal thermal perception and cognitive performance in a steady-state
  temperature.  Methods The present study investigated changes in the fNIRS signal
  during ambient temperature manipulation. Thirty healthy young individuals were selected
  as the subjects, and they were exposed to two steady temperatures of 28.8 and 19 °C.
  After acclimatizing to either temperature, the oxy/deoxy-hemoglobin changes of the
  prefrontal cortex (PFC) were measured in both rest and cognitive task states using
  16-channel fNIRS.  Results Results showed that exposure to different temperatures
  was significantly associated with the brain signals recorded during the task state.
  Many significant correlations were discovered between fNIRS signals and thermal
  perception indices. Furthermore, subjects’ performance changes led to changes in
  the fNIRS signals. Logistic regression showed that fNIRS can determine whether a
  person is thermally comfortable or uncomfortable.
