abstract: In patients with airway obstruction, an increase in breathing frequency
  at rest is commonly associated with a dynamic hyperinflation (DH). In such a situation,
  intercostal muscle oxygenation may be disturbed. This hypothesis was examined in
  a context of simulated airway obstruction in healthy subjects.  After a control
  period of 5 min, twelve participants (20 ± 2 years) breathed at rest through a 20-cmH2O
  expiratory threshold load, either by increasing or reducing their respiratory rate
  (ETLF+ or ETLFsingle bond). Tissue saturation index (TSI) and concentration changes
  in oxyhaemoglobin (oxy[Hb+Mb]) were measured as well as cardiorespiratory variables.  Inspiratory
  capacity was decreased in ETLF+ (p textless 0.001) and correlated with dyspnea.
  An increase in oxy[Hb+Mb] occurred in ETLF+ that was higher than in ETLFsingle bond
  (p textless 0.01). TSI was not different between conditions.  In healthy subjects
  at rest, an increase in respiratory rate during a simulated obstruction with an
  expiratory threshold load resulted in paradoxical response with DH emergence while
  intercostal muscle oxygenation was preserved.
