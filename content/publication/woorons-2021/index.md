abstract: "The goal of this study was to assess the effects of repeated running bouts\
  \ with end-expiratory breath holding (EEBH) up to the breaking point on muscle oxygenation.\
  \ Eight male runners participated in three randomised sessions each including two\
  \ exercises on a motorised treadmill. The first exercise consisted in performing\
  \ 10\u201312 running bouts with EEBH of maximum duration either (separate sessions)\
  \ at 60% (active recovery), 80% (passive recovery) or 100% (passive recovery) of\
  \ the maximal aerobic velocity (MAV). Each repetition started at the onset of EEBH\
  \ and ended at its release. In the second exercise of the session, subjects replicated\
  \ the same procedure but with normal breathing (NB). Arterial oxygen saturation\
  \ (SpO2), heart rate (HR) and the change in vastus lateralis muscle deoxy-haemoglobin/myoglobin\
  \ ($\u0394$[HHb/Mb]) and total haemoglobin/myoglobin ($\u0394$[THb/Mb]) were continuously\
  \ monitored throughout exercises. On average, the EEBHs were maintained for 10.1\
  \ \xB1 1.1 s, 13.2 \xB1 1.8 s and 12.2 \xB1 1.7 s during exercise at 60%, 80% and\
  \ 100% of MAV, respectively. In the three exercise intensities, SpO2 (mean nadir\
  \ values: 76.3 \xB1 2.5 vs 94.5 \xB1 2.5%) and HR were lower with EEBH than with\
  \ NB at the end of the repetitions; whereas, the mean $\u0394$[HHb/Mb] (12.6 \xB1\
  \ 5.2 vs 7.7 \xB1 4.4 \xB5m) and $\u0394$[THb/Mb] (\u2212 0.6 \xB1 2.3 vs 3.8 \xB1\
  \ 2.6 \xB5m) were, respectively, higher and lower with EEBH (p < 0.05). This study\
  \ showed that performing repeated bouts of running exercises with EEBH up to the\
  \ breaking point induced a large and early drop in muscle oxygenation compared with\
  \ the same exercise with NB. This phenomenon was probably the consequence of the\
  \ strong arterial oxygen desaturation induced by the maximal EEBHs."
