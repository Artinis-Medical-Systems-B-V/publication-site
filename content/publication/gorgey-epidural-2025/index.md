abstract: 'Introduction: Implanted spinal cord epidural stimulation (SCES) is an emerging
  neuromodulation approach that increases the excitability of the central pattern
  generator [CPG] and enhances tonic and rhythmic motor patterns after spinal cord
  injury (SCI). We determine the effects of exoskeleton-assisted walking [EAW] + epidural
  stimulation [ES] + resistance training [RT] on volitional motor control as a primary
  outcome, as well as autonomic cardiovascular profile, body composition, and bladder
  function compared to EAW + delayed ES + noRT in persons with motor-complete SCI
  AIS A and B. Methods and Analysis: Twenty male and female participants [age 18–60
  years] with traumatic motor-complete SCI [2 years or more post injury], and level
  of injury below C5 were randomized into either EAW + ES + RT or EAW + delayed-ES
  + no-RT groups for more than 12 months. Baseline, post-interventions 1 and 2 were
  conducted six months apart. Measurements included body composition assessment using
  anthropometry, dual x-ray absorptiometry, and magnetic resonance imaging prior to
  implantation to evaluate the extent of spinal cord damage, neurophysiologic assessments
  to record H-reflexes, overground ambulation and peak torque for both groups, and
  the Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury Scale [WISCI 2]. Metabolic profile measurements
  included the resting metabolic rate, fasting biomarkers of HbA1c, lipid panels,
  total testosterone CRP, IL-6, TNF-α, plasma IGF-I, IGFBP-3, and then a glucose tolerance
  test. Finally, urodynamic testing was conducted to assess functional bladder improvement
  due to ES. Results: The restoration of locomotion with ES and EAW may result in
  a reduction in psychosocial, cardiovascular, and metabolic bladder parameters and
  socioeconomic burden. The addition of the resistance training paradigm may further
  augment the outcomes of ES on motor function in persons with SCI. Conclusions: Percutaneous
  SCES appears to be a feasible and safe rehabilitation approach for the restoration
  of motor function in persons with SCI. The procedure may be successfully implemented
  with other task-specific training similar to EAW and resistance training.'
