 abstract = {Introduction. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is used as a neuroimaging tool for the study of different areas of the  brain  involved  in  motor  control  through  the  measurement  of  changes  in  brain  hemodynamics.  Its  wireless  usage  and  portability  has  made  it  suitable  for  investigating  the  cortical  control  of  postural  balance  under  static  and  dynamic  testing  conditions. Aim  of  Study.  The  aim  of  this  systematic  review  is  to  evaluate  studies  on  cortical  activation  while  performing  static  and  dynamic  balance  tasks  using  fNIRS  as  a  tool  and  emphasizing the location of brain areas activated. Material and Methods. The  search  was  performed  following  the  PRISMA  guidelines. Relevant keywords were used for the search through Google  Scholar,  PubMed,  Science  Direct,  Taylor  and  Francis,  and  Scopus.  The  methodological  quality  of  included  studies  was  assessed  using  the  Downs  and  Black  checklist.  Ten  studies  met  the  inclusion  criteria.  Results.  The  included  studies  were  found  to  be  of  good  methodological  quality.  The  results  in  this  review  showed  that  the  dorsolateral  prefrontal  cortex,  sensory  motor  area  and  superior  temporal  gyrus  are  activated  predominantly   during   static   and   dynamic   balance   tasks.   Conclusions.  The  recent  findings  reflect  a  whole  new  scope  of analysis involving multitasking during complex motor activities. The fNIRS technique is an adjunct to assess static and dynamic postural imbalances in persons with balance related issues with availability of a greater number of channels and more regions of interest to be covered at one given instance.},
