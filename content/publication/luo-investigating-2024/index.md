abstract: 'Maintaining good situation awareness is crucial for workersâ€™ safety on
  the dynamic and complex construction site, and workers with more experience may
  contribute to better performance in safety. However, little research has investigated
  the cognitive differences between experienced and novice workers regarding different
  levels of situation awareness (Level 1: perception, Level 2: comprehension, Level
  3: projection). To address this gap, this study investigated the cognitive processes
  of hazard recognition behaviors among experienced and novice participants using
  functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) across 12 virtual reality scenarios.
  The results revealed that novice participants showed higher activation in the left
  prefrontal cortex across all three levels of situation awareness, indicating their
  tendency to focus on detailed information when faced with unfamiliar environments.
  In contrast, more experienced workers exhibited increased activation in the right
  prefrontal cortex, particularly in hazard comprehension and projection (Level 2
  and Level 3). This suggests that experienced participants prioritize global control
  mechanisms by activating the right prefrontal cortex associated with spatial awareness.
  These results highlight cognitive differences at different levels of situation awareness
  between experienced and novice participants, providing insights into following behavioral
  patterns and decisions. Furthermore, these findings offer a theoretical foundation
  for tailoring safety interventions to address the cognitive deficiencies in each
  level of situation awareness.'
