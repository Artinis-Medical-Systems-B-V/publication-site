abstract: "Background: Complex walking conditions (e.g. dual tasking) have been associated\
  \ with increased prefrontal (PFC) activity. However, most paradigms include a predictable\
  \ environment, specifically, a predictable walking terrain. In the present study\
  \ we investigate PFC activity under an unusual walking condition where each foot\
  \ placement was on unexpected terrain, thus causing a mismatch between visuospatial\
  \ perception and lower-extremity proprioception. Research objective: To assess whether\
  \ PFC activity increases under unstable unpredictable conditions compared to unstable\
  \ but predictable conditions. Methods: This was a prospective study involving twenty\
  \ healthy adults. Participants walked in two conditions: unstable but predictable,\
  \ and unstable and unpredictable. To assess walking stability, both stride-time\
  \ (ST) and stride-time variability (CV) were measured. To assess PFC activity, two\
  \ wireless near-infrared spectroscopy devices were used. The group hemodynamic response\
  \ (GHR) was calculated for each condition. For statistical analysis, a linear-mixed-effects\
  \ model was used. Results: Walking with unpredictable perturbations did not change\
  \ the ST (t = 0.51, p = 0.61) but significantly increased the parameter CV (t =\
  \ 11.74, p < 0.001). The GHR of both conditions indicated brief per-initiation PFC\
  \ activity that was similar across conditions. However, when GHRs were calculated\
  \ relative to normal walking (i.e., the participants' own shoes), continuous activity\
  \ was evident. Compared to the predictable condition, the unpredictable condition\
  \ significantly increased this activity during steady-state walking (t = 2.13, p\
  \ = 0.033). Significance: Observations from the present study suggest that at least\
  \ two neural components are present in the measured signal\u2014a brief one, occurring\
  \ per-initiation, and a continuous one, sensitive to the predictability of the terrain.\
  \ The second component was accompanied by a decrease in walking stability. These\
  \ results may contribute to our understanding of the control mechanism underlying\
  \ gait and future planning of rehabilitation protocols."
