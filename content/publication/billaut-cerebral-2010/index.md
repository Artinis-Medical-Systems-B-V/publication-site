abstract: "Aim: The reduction in cerebral oxygenation (Cox) is associated with the\
  \ cessation of exercise during constant work rate and incremental tests to exhaustion.\
  \ Yet in exercises of this nature, ecological validity is limited due to work rate\
  \ being either fully or partly dictated by the protocol, and it is unknown whether\
  \ cerebral deoxygenation also occurs during self-paced exercise. Here, we investigated\
  \ the cerebral haemodynamics during a 5-km running time trial in trained runners.\
  \ Methods: Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and surface electromyogram (EMG) of\
  \ lower limb muscles were recorded every 0.5 km. Changes in Cox (prefrontal lobe)\
  \ were monitored via near-infrared spectroscopy through concentration changes in\
  \ oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin ($\u03B4$[O 2Hb], $\u03B4$[HHb]). Changes in total Hb\
  \ were calculated ($\u03B4$[THb] = $\u03B4$[O2Hb] + $\u03B4$[HHb]) and used as an\
  \ index of change in regional blood volume. Results: During the trial, RPE increased\
  \ from 6.6 \xB1 0.6 to 19.1 \xB1 0.7 indicating maximal exertion. Cox rose from\
  \ baseline to 2.5 km (\u2191$\u03B4$[O2Hb], \u2191$\u03B4$[HHb], \u2191$\u03B4$[THb]),\
  \ remained constant between 2.5 and 4.5 km, and fell from 4.5 to 5 km (\u2193$\u03B4\
  $[O2Hb], \u2191$\u03B4$[HHb], \u2194$\u03B4$[THb]). Interestingly, the drop in Cox\
  \ at the end of the trial coincided with a final end spurt in treadmill speed and\
  \ concomitant increase in skeletal muscle recruitment (as revealed by higher lower\
  \ limb EMG). Conclusion: Results confirm the large tolerance for change in Cox during\
  \ exercise at sea level, yet further indicate that, in conditions of self-selected\
  \ work rate, cerebral deoxygenation remains within a range that does not hinder\
  \ strenuous exercise performance. \xA9 2009 Scandinavian Physiological Society."
