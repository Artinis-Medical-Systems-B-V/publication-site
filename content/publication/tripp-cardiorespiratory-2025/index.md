abstract: 'Epidemiological evidence suggests low-frequency physical activity provides
  health benefits, but the physiological impacts of weekly training frequency are
  understudied. We investigated whether “Weekend Warrior” (WW) training was inferior
  to traditional, high-frequency (HF) training for improving maximal oxygen uptake
  (V̇O2max). The secondary aim was to assess integrative physiological adaptations
  to each protocol. Twenty-eight sedentary-to-recreationally-active adults aged 18–45 years
  (14 males and 14 females) were randomized to perform 8-weeks of HF or WW training
  on a cycle ergometer (either four or two sessions weekly, respectively), consisting
  of continuous and interval exercise, with intensity and volume matched between groups.
  WW training was not inferior to HF training for improving V̇O2max (mean ± standard
  deviation; WW: 43.5 ± 6.5 vs. 47.8 ± 6.4 mL/kg/min; HF: 42.3 ± 6.2 vs. 47.3 ± 6.7;
  main effect of training, p textless 0.001). Severe domain cycling time-to-task-failure
  also increased in both groups (WW: 3.7 ± 1.6 vs. 8.6 ± 3.2 min; HF: 3.5 ± 0.9 vs.
  7.7 ± 2.8; main effect of training: p textless 0.001). Frequency did not affect
  improvements in hemoglobin mass (WW: 771 ± 203 vs. 790 ± 189 g; HF: 754 ± 185 vs.
  765 ± 202; main effect of training: p = 0.043) or skeletal muscle oxidative capacity
  (WW: 0.034 ± 0.008 vs. 0.045 ± 0.015 s−1; HF: 0.036 ± 0.011 vs. 0.041 ± 0.010; main
  effect of training: p = 0.002), nor did it influence improvements in cardiorespiratory,
  substrate oxidation, voluntary muscle contractile, and perceptual responses to submaximal
  exercise (interaction effect: p textgreater 0.05 for all outcomes). Eight weeks
  of training improved V̇O2max and a wide range of physiological outcomes with no
  difference between training frequencies, suggesting that the distribution of weekly
  exercise volume has a limited effect during short-term training.'
