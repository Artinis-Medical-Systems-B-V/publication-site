abstract: 'While local anesthesia remains standard for muscle biopsies, it often inadequately
  controls procedural pain. General and spinal anesthesia carry risks in neuromuscular
  disorders. Ultrasound-guided nerve block may reduce the risk of anesthetic complications
  and pain during muscle biopsy. We aimed to evaluate the safety and analgesic efficacy
  of ultrasound-guided nerve block during muscle biopsy procedures. We analyzed ten
  consecutive cases undergoing muscle biopsy with ultrasound-guided nerve block from
  April 2022 to April 2024. Data included biopsy site, nerve block location, anesthetic
  agent type, anesthetic dose, procedure timeline (block-to-biopsy interval, biopsy
  duration), pain assessment, and anesthetic complications. Brachial plexus block
  was selected for 6 patients with biceps brachii biopsy, and femoral nerve block
  for 4 patients with quadriceps biopsy. Anesthetics were 1% lidocaine (Xylocaine)
  in 9/10 patients. The mean time from block to biopsy was 15.0 minutes. No complications
  such as nerve injury, vascular injury, or infection occurred. Only 2/10 patients
  reported pain during muscle biopsy (Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores: 3/10 and 4/10).
  Ultrasound-guided nerve block appears safe and effective for pain control during
  muscle biopsy, with 80% complete analgesia and no adverse events. Study limitations
  include a small sample size; larger trials are needed to establish optimal protocols.'
