abstract: Individual differences in the temporal dynamics of the haemodynamic response
  can reflect cortical excitation and can reveal underlying cortical physiology. Here,
  we show differences in the shape of the haemodynamic response that are dependent
  on stimulus parameters. Two sets of visual stimuli were used varying in parameters
  that are known to manipulate the haemodynamic response in the visual cortex. We
  measured the oxyhaemoglobin response using near infrared spectroscopy. The first
  set of stimuli comprised chromatic square-wave gratings that varied with respect
  to the separation in the CIE UCS chromaticities of the alternating bars. The gratings
  with large separations in chromaticity evoked an oxyhaemoglobin response with greater
  amplitude, consistent with greater activation of the visual cortex. The second set
  of stimuli comprised horizontal achromatic gratings that (1) were static, (2) drifted
  at a constant velocity towards fixation, or (3) reversed direction every half spatial
  cycle to create a vertical vibrating motion. Although the three types of grating
  had a similar effect on the amplitude of the oxyhaemoglobin response, the moving
  gratings (2 and 3) evoked a steeper decrease in oxyhaemoglobin concentration after
  stimulus-offset. The steeper slope appears to reflect the post-stimulus undershoot
  and the slope may provide a correlate of cortical excitability when the amplitude
  of the haemodynamic response has saturated.
