abstract: "Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a common tool used to study oxygen\
  \ availability and utilization during repeated-sprint exercise. However, there are\
  \ inconsistent methods of smoothing and determining peaks and nadirs from the NIRS\
  \ signal, which make interpretation and comparisons between studies difficult. To\
  \ examine the effects of averaging method on deoxyhaemoglobin concentration ([HHb])\
  \ trends, nine males performed ten 10-s sprints, with 30\_seconds of recovery, and\
  \ six analysis methods were used for determining peaks and nadirs in the [HHb] signal.\
  \ First, means were calculated over predetermined windows in the last 5 and 2\_\
  seconds of each sprint and recovery period. Second, moving 5-seconds and 2-seconds\
  \ averages were also applied, and peaks/nadirs were determined for each 40-seconds\
  \ sprint/recovery cycle. Third, a Butterworth filter was used to smooth the signal,\
  \ and the resulting signal output was used to determine peaks and nadirs from predetermined\
  \ time points and a rolling approach. Correlation and residual analysis showed that\
  \ the Butterworth filter attenuated the \u201Cnoise\u201D in the signal, while maintaining\
  \ the integrity of the raw data (r\_=.9892; mean standardized residual \u22129.71\_\
  \xD7\_103\_\xB1\_3.80). Means derived from predetermined windows, irrespective of\
  \ length and data smoothing, underestimated the magnitude of peak and nadir [HHb]\
  \ compared to a rolling mean approach. Consequently, sprint-induced metabolic changes\
  \ (inferred from $\u0394$[HHb]) were underestimated. Based on these results, we\
  \ suggest using a digital filter to smooth NIRS data, rather than an arithmetic\
  \ mean, and a rolling approach to determine peaks and nadirs for accurate interpretation\
  \ of muscle oxygenation trends."
