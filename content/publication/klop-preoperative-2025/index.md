abstract: The health benefit of surgery in older adults may be outweighed by negative
  effects on cognitive or physical function. Physical resilience is defined as the
  potential for recovery after a stressor such as surgery. We assessed associations
  between physical resilience measured by orthostatic blood pressure (BP) and cerebral
  oxygenation recovery or grip work (sustained hand grip strength; GW) and postoperative
  outcome in two cohorts of (older) surgical patients. The first cohort (CTC) consisted
  of patients undergoing complex cardiothoracic surgery. The second cohort (GRR) held
  geriatric outpatients undergoing various surgical procedures. Outcome measures were
  length of stay (LoS) and postoperative complications. Negative binomial (LoS) and
  ordinal (complications) regression models were used to determine associations. 261
  patients (113 CTC and 148 GRR) underwent surgery. Median LoS was 10 (CTC) and 5 days
  (GRR). Postoperative complications occurred in 80% (CTC) and 45% (GRR) of patients.
  In CTC, 10 mmHg higher systolic BP recovery was associated with a 12% shorter LoS
  (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.88 (95% CI 0.78–0.98)). 10 s longer sustained hand
  grip was associated with a 5% shorter LoS in GRR (IRR 0.95 (0.90–1.00)), but a 7%
  longer LoS in CTC (IRR 1.07 (1.03–1.11)). No significant associations were found
  with postoperative complications. Orthostatic cerebral oxygenation recovery in CTC
  was not significantly associated with any postoperative outcome. Our results imply
  that resilience indicators might be associated with LoS after surgery. Future research
  should seek to replicate our findings and investigate whether adding resilience
  parameters to preoperative assessment can support postoperative outcome prediction.
