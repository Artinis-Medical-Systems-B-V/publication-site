abstract: Background. In a randomized control trial conducted in patients with Parkinson’s
  disease, a treadmill training program combined with virtual reality that targeted
  motor and cognitive aspects of safe ambulation led to fewer falls, compared with
  treadmill training alone. Objective. To investigate if the 2 types of training differentially
  affected prefrontal activation and if this might explain differences in fall rates
  after the intervention. Methods. Sixty-four patients with Parkinson’s disease were
  randomized into the treadmill training arm (n = 34, mean age 73.1 ± 1.1 years, 64%
  men, disease duration 9.7 ± 1.0 years) or treadmill training with virtual reality
  arm (n = 30, mean age 70.1 ± 1.3 years, 71% men, disease duration 8.9 ± 1.1 years).
  Prefrontal activation during usual, dual-task, and obstacle negotiation walking
  was assessed before and after 6 weeks of training, using a functional near-infrared
  spectroscopy system. Results. Treadmill training with and without virtual reality
  reduced prefrontal activation during walking ( P textless .001), with specific interactions
  related to training arm ( P = .01), lateralization ( P = .05), and walking condition
  ( P = .001). For example, among the subjects who trained with treadmill training
  alone, prefrontal activation during dual-task walking and obstacle negotiation increased
  after training, while in the combined training arm, activation decreased. Conclusions.
  Prefrontal activation during usual and during more challenging walking conditions
  can be altered in response to 2 different types of training. The addition of a cognitive
  training component to a treadmill exercise program apparently modifies the effects
  of the training on the magnitude and lateralization of prefrontal activation and
  on falls, extending the understanding of the plasticity of the brain in PD.
