abstract: "Background. In a randomized control trial conducted in patients with Parkinson's\
  \ disease, a treadmill training program combined with virtual reality that targeted\
  \ motor and cognitive aspects of safe ambulation led to fewer falls, compared with\
  \ treadmill training alone. Objective. To investigate if the 2 types of training\
  \ differentially affected prefrontal activation and if this might explain differences\
  \ in fall rates after the intervention. Methods. Sixty-four patients with Parkinson's\
  \ disease were randomized into the treadmill training arm (n = 34, mean age 73.1\
  \ \xB1 1.1 years, 64% men, disease duration 9.7 \xB1 1.0 years) or treadmill training\
  \ with virtual reality arm (n = 30, mean age 70.1 \xB1 1.3 years, 71% men, disease\
  \ duration 8.9 \xB1 1.1 years). Prefrontal activation during usual, dual-task, and\
  \ obstacle negotiation walking was assessed before and after 6 weeks of training,\
  \ using a functional near-infrared spectroscopy system. Results. Treadmill training\
  \ with and without virtual reality reduced prefrontal activation during walking\
  \ (P <.001), with specific interactions related to training arm (P =.01), lateralization\
  \ (P =.05), and walking condition (P =.001). For example, among the subjects who\
  \ trained with treadmill training alone, prefrontal activation during dual-task\
  \ walking and obstacle negotiation increased after training, while in the combined\
  \ training arm, activation decreased. Conclusions. Prefrontal activation during\
  \ usual and during more challenging walking conditions can be altered in response\
  \ to 2 different types of training. The addition of a cognitive training component\
  \ to a treadmill exercise program apparently modifies the effects of the training\
  \ on the magnitude and lateralization of prefrontal activation and on falls, extending\
  \ the understanding of the plasticity of the brain in PD."
