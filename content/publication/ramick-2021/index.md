abstract: "Background: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients exhibit a reduced exercise\
  \ capacity that impacts quality of life. Dietary nitrate supplementation has been\
  \ shown to have favorable effects on exercise capacity in disease populations by\
  \ reducing the oxygen cost of exercise. This study investigated whether dietary\
  \ nitrates would acutely improve exercise capacity in CKD patients. Methods and\
  \ results: In this randomized, double-blinded crossover study, 12 Stage 3\u2013\
  4 CKD patients (Mean \xB1 SEM: Age, 60 \xB1 5yrs; eGFR, 50.3 \xB1 4.6 ml/min/1.73\
  \ m2) received an acute dose of 12.6 mmol of dietary nitrate in the form of concentrated\
  \ beetroot juice (BRJ) and a nitrate depleted placebo (PLA). Skeletal muscle mitochondrial\
  \ oxidative function was assessed using near-infrared spectroscopy. Cardiopulmonary\
  \ exercise testing was performed on a cycle ergometer, with intensity increased\
  \ by 25 W every 3 min until volitional fatigue. Plasma nitric oxide (NO) metabolites\
  \ (NOm; nitrate, nitrite, low molecular weight S-nitrosothiols, and metal bound\
  \ NO) were determined by gas-phase chemiluminescence. Plasma NOm values were significantly\
  \ increased following BRJ (BRJ vs. PLA: 1074.4 \xB1 120.4 $\u03BC$M vs. 28.4 \xB1\
  \ 6.6 $\u03BC$M, p < 0.001). Total work performed (44.4 \xB1 10.6 vs 39.6 \xB1 9.9\
  \ kJ, p = 0.03) and total exercise time (674 \xB1 85 vs 627 \xB1 86s, p = 0.04)\
  \ were significantly greater following BRJ. Oxygen consumption at the ventilatory\
  \ threshold was also improved by BRJ (0.90 \xB1 0.08 vs. 0.74 \xB1 0.06 L/min, p\
  \ = 0.04). These changes occurred in the absence of improved skeletal muscle mitochondrial\
  \ oxidative capacity (p = 0.52) and VO2peak (p = 0.35). Conclusions: Our findings\
  \ demonstrate that inorganic nitrate can acutely improve exercise capacity in CKD\
  \ patients. The effects of chronic nitrate supplementation on CKD related exercise\
  \ intolerance should be investigated in future studies."
