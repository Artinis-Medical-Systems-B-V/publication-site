abstract: Objective This study investigated the influences of local ischemic preconditioning
  (LIPC) and remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) on muscle deoxygenation before
  and during a 3-min all-out cycling test (3 MT), as well as on 3 MT performance.
  Methods Fifteen male athletes completed LIPC (thighs, 220 mmHg, 4 × 5 min), RIPC
  (upper limbs, 30 mmHg above systolic blood pressure, 4 × 5 min), and SHAM (thighs,
  20 mmHg, 4 × 5 min) interventions in a randomized crossover design, with a 4-day
  washout period between sessions. The 3 MT was conducted 45 min after each intervention.
  Parameters derived from the 3 MT included end-test power output (EP) and the work
  performed above EP (WEP). Muscle oxygenation of the thigh and blood biochemical
  variables (lactate, pH, nitric oxide, and norepinephrine) were assessed before and
  during exercise. Results During the resting period between the intervention and
  the 3 MT, deoxyhemoglobin and total hemoglobin were significantly higher in the
  LIPC condition than in RIPC and SHAM (P textless 0.05). However, no significant
  differences were observed among conditions in peak oxygen uptake, slow component
  amplitude, EP, WEP, or blood biochemical variables during the 3 MT. Conclusion LIPC
  increased muscle total hemoglobin during the post-intervention resting period, particularly
  within 10 min of the final occlusion. However, neither LIPC nor RIPC improved performance
  during high-intensity cycling exercise
