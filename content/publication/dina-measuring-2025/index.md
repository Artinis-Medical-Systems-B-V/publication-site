abstract: 'Inhibitory control develops over time and is linked to fronto-striatal
  maturation. Traditional computerised assessments often lack ecological validity
  and are not age appropriate. Here, we developed a naturalistic, age-appropriate
  paradigm using a cave automatic virtual environment (CAVE) and mobile functional
  near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure response inhibition in children aged
  3–7-years. The new task was validated in adults (N = 24, Mage = 30.38, SD = 10.54),
  and children (N = 36, Mage = 4.44, SDage = 1.11 years). Participants completed two
  Go/No-Go tasks: a standard computer-based version and an adapted CAVE version, while
  fNIRS recorded brain activity in the bilateral dorsolateral frontal cortices. The
  aims were to compare behavioural performance in the CAVE and computer tasks, establish
  if the tasks capture developmental differences in inhibitory control, assess their
  psychometric properties (convergent and divergent validity), determine the feasibility
  and acceptability of the multimodal CAVE-fNIRS setup in early childhood, and characterise
  the neural correlates of response inhibition in both 2D and 3D tasks. Consistent
  with typical Go/No-Go tasks, we found higher error rates in mixed blocks compared
  to Go-only blocks. No significant correlations were found between self-reported
  (adults) or parent-reported (children) inhibition measures and task performance,
  nor between performance metrics across the CAVE and computer tasks, though children
  generally exhibited poorer performance across most metrics compared to adults, reflecting
  the prolonged developmental trajectory of inhibitory control. The novel CAVE task
  proved feasible and acceptable, with high completion rates and absent or minimal
  virtual reality-induced symptoms. Specific to the early childhood sample, Go/No-Go
  blocks in the CAVE task elicited higher activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus.
  This study shows the brain correlates of response inhibition during unrestricted
  movement in 2D and 3D settings in young children, integrating age-appropriate fNIRS
  with an immersive CAVE, opening potential new approaches to studying neurodevelopment.'
