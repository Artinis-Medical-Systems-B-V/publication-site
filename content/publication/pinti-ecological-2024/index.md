abstract: Significance The advances and miniaturization in functional near-infrared
  spectroscopy (fNIRS) instrumentation offer the potential to move the classical laboratory-based
  cognitive neuroscience investigations into more naturalistic settings. Wearable
  and mobile fNIRS devices also provide a novel child-friendly means to image functional
  brain activity in freely moving toddlers and preschoolers. Measuring brain activity
  in more ecologically valid settings with fNIRS presents additional challenges, such
  as the increased impact of physiological interferences. One of the most popular
  methods for minimizing such interferences is to regress out short separation channels
  from the long separation channels [i.e., superficial signal regression (SSR)]. Although
  this has been extensively investigated in adults, little is known about the impact
  of systemic changes on the fNIRS signals recorded in children in either classical
  or novel naturalistic experiments. Aim We aim to investigate if extracerebral physiological
  changes occur in toddlers and preschoolers and whether SSR can help minimize these
  interferences. Approach We collected fNIRS data from 3- to 7-year-olds during a
  conventional computerized static task and in a dynamic naturalistic task in an immersive
  virtual reality (VR) cave automatic virtual environment. Results Our results show
  that superficial signal contamination data are present in young children as in adults.
  Importantly, we find that SSR helps in improving the localization of functional
  brain activity, both in the computerized task and, to a larger extent, in the dynamic
  VR task. Conclusions Following these results, we formulate suggestions to advance
  the field of developmental neuroimaging with fNIRS, particularly in ecological settings.
