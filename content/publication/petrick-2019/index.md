abstract: "Key points: Blood flow restricted resistance exercise (BFR-RE) is capable\
  \ of inducing comparable adaptations to traditional resistance exercise (RE), despite\
  \ a lower total exercise volume. It has been suggested that an increase in reactive\
  \ oxygen species (ROS) production may be involved in this response; however, oxygen\
  \ partial pressure (PO2) is reduced during BFR-RE, and the influence of PO2 on mitochondrial\
  \ redox balance remains poorly understood. In human skeletal muscle tissue, we demonstrate\
  \ that both maximal and submaximal mitochondrial ROS emission rates are acutely\
  \ decreased 2\_h following BFR-RE, but not RE, occurring along with a reduction\
  \ in tissue oxygenation during BFR-RE. We further suggest that PO2 is involved in\
  \ this response because an in vitro analysis revealed that reducing PO2 dramatically\
  \ decreased mitochondrial ROS emissions and electron leak to ROS. Altogether, these\
  \ data indicate that mitochondrial ROS emission rates are attenuated following BFR-RE,\
  \ and such a response is likely influenced by reductions in PO2. Abstract: Low-load\
  \ blood flow restricted resistance exercise (BFR-RE) training has been proposed\
  \ to induce comparable adaptations to traditional resistance exercise (RE) training,\
  \ however, the acute signalling events remain unknown. Although a suggested mechanism\
  \ of BFR-RE is an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, oxygen partial\
  \ pressure (PO2) is reduced during BFR-RE, and the influence of O2 tension on mitochondrial\
  \ redox balance remains ambiguous. We therefore aimed to determine whether skeletal\
  \ muscle mitochondrial bioenergetics were altered following an acute bout of BFR-RE\
  \ or RE, and to further examine the role of PO2 in this response. Accordingly, muscle\
  \ biopsies were obtained from 10 males at rest and 2\_h after performing three sets\
  \ of single-leg squats (RE or BFR-RE) to failure at 30% one-repetition maximum.\
  \ We determined that mitochondrial respiratory capacity and ADP sensitivity were\
  \ not altered in response to RE or BFR-RE. Although maximal (succinate) and submaximal\
  \ (non-saturating ADP) mitochondrial ROS emission rates were unchanged following\
  \ RE, BFR-RE attenuated these responses by \u223C30% compared to pre-exercise, occurring\
  \ along with a reduction in skeletal muscle tissue oxygenation during BFR-RE (P\_\
  <\_0.01 vs. RE). In a separate cohort of participants, evaluation of mitochondrial\
  \ bioenergetics in vitro revealed that mild O2 restriction (50\_\xB5m) dramatically\
  \ attenuated maximal (\u223C4-fold) and submaximal (\u223C50-fold) mitochondrial\
  \ ROS emission rates and the fraction of electron leak to ROS compared to room air\
  \ (200\_\xB5m). Combined, these data demonstrate that mitochondrial ROS emissions\
  \ are attenuated following BFR-RE, a response which may be mediated by a reduction\
  \ in skeletal muscle PO2."
