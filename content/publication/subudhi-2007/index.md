abstract: "To determine if fatigue at maximal aerobic power output was associated\
  \ with a critical decrease in cerebral oxygenation, 13 male cyclists performed incremental\
  \ maximal exercise tests (25 W/min ramp) under normoxic (Norm: 21% FIO2) and acute\
  \ hypoxic (Hypox: 12% FIO2) conditions. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used\
  \ to monitor concentration ($\u03BC$M) changes of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin ($\u0394\
  $[O2Hb], $\u0394$[HHb]) in the left vastus lateralis muscle and frontal cerebral\
  \ cortex. Changes in total Hb were calculated ($\u0394$[THb] = $\u0394$[O2Hb] +\
  \ $\u0394$[HHb]) and used as an index of change in regional blood volume. Repeated-measures\
  \ ANOVA were performed across treatments and work rates ($\u03B1$ = 0.05). During\
  \ Norm, cerebral oxygenation rose between 25 and 75% peak power output Power peak;\
  \ increased (inc) $\u0394$[O2Hb], inc. $\u0394$[HHb], inc. $\u0394$[THb], but fell\
  \ from 75 to 100% Powerpeak decreased (dec) $\u0394$[O2Hb], inc. $\u0394$[HHb],\
  \ no change $\u0394$[THb]. In contrast, during Hypox, cerebral oxygenation dropped\
  \ progressively across all work rates (dec. $\u0394$[O2Hb], inc. $\u0394$[HHb]),\
  \ whereas $\u0394$[THb] again rose up to 75% Powerpeak and remained constant thereafter.\
  \ Changes in cerebral oxygenation during Hypox were larger than Norm. In muscle,\
  \ oxygenation decreased progressively throughout exercise in both Norm and Hypox\
  \ (dec. $\u0394$[O2Hb], inc. $\u0394$ [HHb], inc. $\u0394$[THb]), although $\u0394\
  $[O2Hb] was unchanged between 75 and 100% Powerpeak. Changes in muscle oxygenation\
  \ were also greater in Hypox compared with Norm. On the basis of these findings,\
  \ it is unlikely that changes in cerebral oxygenation limit incremental exercise\
  \ performance in normoxia, yet it is possible that such changes play a more pivotal\
  \ role in hypoxia. Copyright \xA9 2007 the American Physiological Society."
