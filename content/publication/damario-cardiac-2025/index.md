abstract: Recent empirical investigations suggest that music performance and perception
  can evoke a collective cardiac response in performers and audience members, and
  interpersonal cardiac coupling can be related to musical features. However, the
  relationship between musicians’ and audiences’ cardiac responses is poorly understood.
  This study investigates the interpersonal cardiac coherence of selected audience
  members and performers from the Stavanger Symphony Orchestra and the Norwegian Radio
  Orchestra during multiple performances of Harald Sæverud’s Kjempeviseslåtten. The
  cardiac coherence index (CCI) was computed by applying the intrinsic synchrosqueezing
  transform to the cardiac interbeat interval of each signal, combining noise-assisted
  multivariate empirical mode decomposition and short-time Fourier transforms. The
  results show that the CCI values among the audience members were stronger than those
  of the musicians. Sound pressure level measurements predicted the musicians’ CCI
  values, whilst musical form structure predicted the audiences’ CCI values. These
  results advance our understanding of how cardiac rhythms support interpersonal interactions
  and contribute to research on live orchestra performances.
