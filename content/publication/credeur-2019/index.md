abstract: "Aim: Exercise training with blood flow restriction (BFR) increases muscle\
  \ size and strength. However, there is limited investigation into the effects of\
  \ BFR on cardiovascular health, particularly central hemodynamic load. Purpose:\
  \ To determine the effects of BFR exercise on central hemodynamic load (heart rate\u2014\
  HR, central pressures, arterial wave reflection, and aortic stiffness). Methods:\
  \ Fifteen males (age = 25 \xB1 2 years; BMI = 27 \xB1 2\_kg/m2, handgrip max voluntary\
  \ contraction-MVC = 50 \xB1 2\_kg) underwent 5-min bouts (counter-balanced, 10\_\
  min rest between) of rhythmic unilateral handgrip (1\_s squeeze, 2\_s relax) performed\
  \ with a moderate-load (60% MVC) with and without BFR (i.e., 71 \xB1 5% arterial\
  \ inflow flow reduction, assessed via Doppler ultrasound), and also with a low-load\
  \ (40% MVC) with BFR. Outcomes included HR, central mean arterial pressure (cMAP),\
  \ arterial wave reflection (augmentation index, AIx; wave reflection magnitude,\
  \ RM%), aortic arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity, aPWV), and peripheral (vastus\
  \ lateralis) microcirculatory response (tissue saturation index, TSI%). Results:\
  \ HR increased above baseline and time control for all handgrip bouts, but was similar\
  \ between the moderate load with and without BFR conditions (moderate-load with\
  \ BFR = + 9 \xB1 2; moderate-load without BFR = + 8 \xB1 2\_bpm, p < 0.001). A similar\
  \ finding was noted for central pressure (e.g., moderate load with BFR, cMAP = +\
  \ 14 \xB1 1\_mmHg, p < 0.001). No change occurred for RM% or AIx (p > 0.05) for\
  \ any testing stage. TSI% increased during the moderate-load conditions (p = 0.01),\
  \ and aPWV increased above baseline following moderate-load handgrip with BFR only\
  \ (p = 0.012). Conclusions: Combined with BFR, moderate load handgrip training with\
  \ BFR does not significantly augment central hemodynamic load during handgrip exercise\
  \ in young healthy men."
