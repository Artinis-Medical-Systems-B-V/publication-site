abstract: "Purpose The physiological consequences of freely chosen cadence during\
  \ cycling remains poorly understood. We sought to determine the effect of cadence\
  \ on the respiratory and hemodynamic response to cycling exercise. Methods Eleven\
  \ cyclists (10 males, 1 female; age, 27 \xB1 6 yr; VO2max = 60.8 \xB1 3.7 mL\u02D9\
  kg-1\u02D9min-1) completed four, 6-min constant-load cycling trials at 10% below\
  \ their previously determined gas exchange threshold (i.e., 63% \xB1 5% peak power)\
  \ while pedaling at 60, 90, and 120 rpm, and a freely chosen cadence (94.3 \xB1\
  \ 6.9 rpm) in randomized order. Standard cardiorespiratory parameters were measured\
  \ and an esophageal electrode balloon catheter was used to assess electromyography\
  \ of the diaphragm (EMGdi) and the work of breathing (Wb). Leg blood flow index\
  \ (BFI) was determined on four muscles using near-infrared spectroscopy with indocyanine\
  \ green dye injections. Results Oxygen uptake (VO2) increased as a function of increasing\
  \ cadence (all pairwise comparisons, P < 0.05). The EMGdi and Wb were significantly\
  \ greater at 120 rpm compared with all other conditions (all P < 0.01). Vastus medialis\
  \ and semitendinosus BFI were significantly greater at 120 rpm compared with 60\
  \ and 90 rpm (all P < 0.05). Gastrocnemius BFI was higher at 120 rpm compared with\
  \ all other cadences (all P < 0.01). No difference in BFI was found in the vastus\
  \ lateralis (P = 0.06). Blood flow index was significantly correlated with the increase\
  \ in VO2 with increasing cadence in the medial gastrocnemius (P < 0.001) and approached\
  \ significance in the vastus lateralis (P = 0.09), vastus medialis (P = 0.06), and\
  \ semitendinosus (P = 0.09). There was no effect of cadence on Borg 0-10 breathing\
  \ or leg discomfort ratings (P > 0.05). Conclusions High cadence cycling at submaximal\
  \ exercise intensities is metabolically inefficient and increases EMGdi, Wb, and\
  \ leg muscle blood flow relative to slower cadences."
