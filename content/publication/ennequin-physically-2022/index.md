abstract: 'Purpose: Post-meal cardiometabolic responses are critical for health, and
  may be influenced by physical activity. The objective of this study was to investigate
  the effect of habitual physical activity level on the metabolic, autonomic nervous
  system and cardiovascular responses to a balanced meal in healthy men.  Methods:
  12 active and 12 inactive healthy males, matched for age and body composition, attended
  the laboratory in fasting condition. Participants were asked to sit quietly and
  comfortably in an armchair for the whole duration of the experiment (~ 2h30). Metabolic,
  autonomic nervous system and cardiovascular measurements were performed in fasting
  conditions, and at regular intervals until one hour after the end of a balanced
  breakfast.  Results: No significant difference was observed between groups in glycaemia
  or energy expenditure throughout the experiment. Fat oxidation rate was significantly
  higher one-hour post-meal in active vs inactive men (Respiratory Quotient: 0.78
  ± 0.04 vs 0.88 ± 0.03; p textless 0.01). Heart rate was significantly lower in active
  compared to inactive individuals (p textless 0.001) throughout the experiment and
  active participants displayed significantly enhanced vagal tone one-hour post-meal
  (square root of the sum of successive differences between adjacent normal R-R intervals
  squared: 72.4 ± 27.9 vs 46.4 ± 14.1 ms; p textless 0.05).  Conclusion: In healthy
  men, habitual physical activity level seems discriminant to decipher specific profiles
  in terms of cardiometabolic responses to a meal. Overall, it may suggest pre-signal
  cardiometabolic impairments in healthy inactive individuals and highlight the need
  to consider primary prevention in inactive subjects as a key factor for health management.'
