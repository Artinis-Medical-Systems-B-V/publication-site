abstract: The LEGO model was used to simulate the actual assembly line assembly operation,
  and a repetitive assembly task experiment was designed, taking into account the
  differences in the skills of adjacent assembly personnel, and the behavior performance
  data of the personnel combination during the task was recorded. Simultaneously,
  the fNIRS near-infrared device was utilized to track changes in HBO2 concentration
  in the prefrontal lobe of the assembled brain, in order to investigate the impact
  of differences in adjacent assembly personnelâ€™s combined skills on job performance.
  The results of the experimental analysis show that the assembly error rate and task
  completion time do not show a relationship of first increasing and then decreasing
  with the difference in the skills of the personnel combination; however, within
  a certain range, the brain load of the personnel combination will increase as the
  skill difference increases. When the skill gap is too wide, it will play a part
  in reducing mental stress. As a result, when designing personnel arrangements to
  reduce worker load and improve production efficiency, manufacturing businesses should
  take into account the differences in skills between neighboring operators.
