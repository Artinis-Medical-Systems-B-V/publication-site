abstract: 'Optimizing collaborative behavior is crucial in educational activities,
  directly improving academic performance, social skills, and social-emotional learning
  for both teachers and students. In an effort to decipher the mechanisms underlying
  the effectiveness of collaborative learning, educators and neuroscientists have
  initiated the collection and analysis of learnersâ€™ physiological parameters during
  such collaborative exercises. Considering both accuracy and portability, functional
  near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as a viable tool. The current study
  aims to understand its potential for studying neural mechanisms of collaboration.
  Sixty articles were reviewed from three databases to address three research questions:
  (1) What are the characteristics (i.e., number of publications per year and for
  different age groups of participants, sample size, and the usage of fNIRS devices)
  of fNIRS-based collaboration research? (2) What experimental designs are commonly
  employed in fNIRS-based collaboration research? (3) What is the relationship between
  neural activity and interactive behavioral performance? The results provide a comprehensive
  descriptive statistical analysis of the literature characteristics and offer a detailed
  summary of the research methods employed, including the experimental protocol, task,
  and duration. Importantly, these findings demonstrate compelling evidence of inter-brain
  synchrony (IBS), indicating synchronized cortical activities between interacting
  individuals, and it was observed in the prefrontal cortex or temporoparietal cortex
  during collaboration and interaction tasks, highlighting the crucial role of these
  brain regions in facilitating collaborative behavior. The finding of this review
  advanced our understanding of how fNIRS is ultilized in collaborative research and
  offer practical implications for designing educational interventions or programs
  aimd at enhancing collaborative behaviors and their associated benefits.'
