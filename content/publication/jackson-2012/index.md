abstract: The impact of dietary n-3 PUFA on behavioural outcomes has been widely researched;
  however, very little attention has been given to their impact on brain functioning
  in physiological terms. A total of twenty-two healthy adults took part in this double-blind,
  placebo-controlled study, wherein the cerebral haemodynamic effects of 12 weeks
  of daily dietary supplementation with either 1 g DHA-rich or 1 g EPA-rich fish oil
  (FO) or placebo (1 g olive oil) were assessed. Relative changes in the concentration
  of oxygenated Hb (oxy-Hb) and deoxygenated Hb were assessed in the prefrontal cortex
  using near IR spectroscopy (NIRS) during the performance of four computerised cognitive
  tasks. Supplementation with DHA-rich FO, in comparison with placebo, resulted in
  a significant increase in the concentrations of oxy-Hb and total levels of Hb, indicative
  of increased cerebral blood flow (CBF), during the cognitive tasks. In comparison,
  no effect on CBF was observed following supplementation with EPA-rich FO, where
  concentration changes in the chromophores followed the same pattern as placebo.
  These encouraging pilot data warrant further application of NIRS in this area.
