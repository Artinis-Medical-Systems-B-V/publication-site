abstract: "Fatigue resistance of knee extensor muscles is higher during voluntary\
  \ isometric contractions at short compared with longer muscle lengths. In the present\
  \ study we hypothesized that this would be due to lower energy consumption, at short\
  \ muscle lengths. Ten healthy male subjects performed isometric contractions with\
  \ the knee extensor muscles at a 30, 60, and 90\xB0 knee angle (full extension =\
  \ 0\xB0). At each angle, muscle oxygen consumption (mV\u0307O2) of the rectus femoris,\
  \ vastus lateralis, and vastus medialis muscle was obtained with near-infrared spectroscopy.\
  \ mV\u0307O 2 was measured during maximal isometric contractions and during contractions\
  \ at 10, 30, and 50% of maximal torque capacity. During all contractions, blood\
  \ flow to the muscle was occluded with a pressure cuff (450 mmHg). mV\u0307O2 significantly\
  \ (P < 0.05) increased with torque and at all torque levels, and for each of the\
  \ three muscles mV\u0307O2 was significantly lower at 30\xB0 compared with 60\xB0\
  \ and 90\xB0 and mV\u0307O2 was similar (P > 0.05) at 60\xB0 and 90\xB0. Across\
  \ all torque levels, average (\xB1 SD) mV\u0307O2 at the 30\xB0 angle for vastus\
  \ medialis, rectus femoris, and vastus lateralis, respectively, was 70.0 \xB1 10.4,\
  \ 72.2 \xB1 12.7, and 75.9 \xB1 8.0% of the average mV\u0307O2 obtained for each\
  \ torque at 60 and 90\xB0. In conclusion, oxygen consumption of the knee extensors\
  \ was significantly lower during isometric contractions at the 30\xB0 than at the\
  \ 60\xB0 and 90\xB0 knee angle, which probably contributes to the previously reported\
  \ longer duration of sustained isometric contractions at relatively short muscle\
  \ lengths. Copyright \xA9 2005 the American Physiological Society."
