abstract: 'This single-blind, crossover study aimed to measure and evaluate the short-term
  metabolic responses to continuous and intermittent hypoxic patterns in individuals
  with obesity. Indirect calorimetry was used to quantify changes in resting metabolic
  rate (RMR), carbohydrate (CHO ox , %CHO) and fat oxidation (FAT ox , %FAT) in nine
  individuals with obesity pre- and post-: (i) breathing normoxic air [normoxic sham
  control (NS-control)]; (ii) breathing continuous hypoxia (CH); or (iii) breathing
  intermittent hypoxia (IH). A mean peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) of 80-85%
  was achieved over a total of 45 minutes of hypoxia. Throughout each intervention
  pulmonary gas exchanges - oxygen consumption ( ), carbon dioxide production ( -
  and deoxyhaemoglobin concentration ( [HHb]) in the vastus lateralis were measured.
  Both RMR and CHO ox measured pre- and post-interventions were unchanged following
  each treatment: NS-control; CH; or IH (all p textgreater 0.05). Conversely, a significant
  increase in FAT ox was evident between pre- and post-IH (+44%, p = 0.048). While
  the mean [HHb] values significantly increased during both IH and CH ( ptextless0.05),
  the greatest zenith of [HHb] was achieved in IH compared to CH ( p = 0.002). Furthermore,
  there was a positive correlation between ∆[HHb] and the shift in FAT ox measured
  pre- and post-intervention. It is suggested that during IH the increased bouts of
  muscle hypoxia, revealed by elevated ∆[HHb], coupled with cyclic periods of excess
  post-hypoxia oxygen consumption (EPHOC, inherent to the intermittent pattern) played
  a significant role in driving the increase in FAT ox post-IH.'
