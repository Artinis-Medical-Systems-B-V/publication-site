 abstract = {Purpose: This study investigated the physical fitness and oxygen uptake kinetics (τ[Formula: see text]) along with the O2 delivery and utilization (heart rate kinetics, τHR; deoxyhemoglobin/[Formula: see text] ratio, ∆[HHb]/[Formula: see text]) adaptations of untrained female participants responding to 4 weeks of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and 2 weeks of detraining.

Methods: Participants were randomly assigned to HIIT (n = 11, 4 × 4 protocol) or nonexercising control (n = 9) groups. Exercising group engaged 4 weeks of treadmill HIIT followed by 2 weeks of detraining while maintaining daily activity level. Ramp-incremental (RI) tests and step-transitions to moderate-intensity exercise were performed. Aerobic capacity and performance (maximal oxygen uptake, [Formula: see text]; gas-exchange threshold, GET; power output, PO), body composition (skeletal muscle mass, SMM; body fat percentage, BF%), muscle oxygenation status (∆[HHb]), [Formula: see text], and HR kinetics were assessed.

Results: HIIT elicited improvements in aerobic capacity ([Formula: see text], + 0.17 ± 0.04 L/min; GET, + 0.18 ± 0.05 L/min, P \textless 0.01; PO-[Formula: see text], ± 23.36 ± 8.37 W; PO-GET, + 17.18 ± 3.07 W, P \textless 0.05), body composition (SMM, + 0.92 ± 0.17 kg; BF%, - 3.08% ± 0.58%, P \textless 0.001), and speed up the τ[Formula: see text] (- 8.04 ± 1.57 s, P \textless 0.001) significantly, extending to better ∆[HHb]/[Formula: see text] ratio (1.18 ± 0.08 to 1.05 ± 0.14). After a period of detraining, the adaptation in body composition and aerobic capacity, as well as the accelerated τ[Formula: see text] were maintained in the HIIT group, but the PO-[Formula: see text] and PO-GET declined below the post-training level (P \textless 0.05), whereas no changes were reported in controls (P \textgreater 0.05). Four weeks of HIIT induced widespread physiological adaptations in females, and the majority of improvements were preserved after 2 weeks of detraining except for power output corresponding to [Formula: see text] and GET.},
