abstract: 'Purpose: Balance is crucial for an individual''s capacity to maintain an
  upright position during both static and dynamic conditions. Balance control is a
  complex sensory-motor action based on automated and spinal reflexes, under the influence
  of several distinct and separate supraspinal centres in the brainstem, cerebellum,
  and cortex. However, cortical neural activation during the functioning of sensory
  feedback mechanisms involved in the dynamic balance of the sporting group (SG) and
  non-sporting group (NSG) of young adults is yet to be evaluated. Thus, we evaluated
  hemodynamic changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) following a dynamic balance task
  in SG and NSG of young adults.  Materials and methods: The dynamic balance of 48
  participants was evaluated using the wobble board of the Kinematics Measurement
  System. Hemodynamic changes were recorded using Functional Near Infra-red Spectroscopy
  System during the dynamic balance task.  Results: SG performed significantly better
  (p textless .05) on the dynamic balance, as compared to the NSG. PFC hemodynamics
  was significantly different (p textless .05) in SG and NSG.  Conclusion: We conclude
  that superior balance scores in SG compared to NSG are associated with different
  areas of activation of PFC during dynamic balance tasks.'
