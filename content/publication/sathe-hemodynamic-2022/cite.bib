 abstract = {Purpose: Balance is crucial for an individual's capacity to maintain an upright position during both static and dynamic conditions. Balance control is a complex sensory-motor action based on automated and spinal reflexes, under the influence of several distinct and separate supraspinal centres in the brainstem, cerebellum, and cortex. However, cortical neural activation during the functioning of sensory feedback mechanisms involved in the dynamic balance of the sporting group (SG) and non-sporting group (NSG) of young adults is yet to be evaluated. Thus, we evaluated hemodynamic changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) following a dynamic balance task in SG and NSG of young adults.

Materials and methods: The dynamic balance of 48 participants was evaluated using the wobble board of the Kinematics Measurement System. Hemodynamic changes were recorded using Functional Near Infra-red Spectroscopy System during the dynamic balance task.

Results: SG performed significantly better (p \textless .05) on the dynamic balance, as compared to the NSG. PFC hemodynamics was significantly different (p \textless .05) in SG and NSG.

Conclusion: We conclude that superior balance scores in SG compared to NSG are associated with different areas of activation of PFC during dynamic balance tasks.},
