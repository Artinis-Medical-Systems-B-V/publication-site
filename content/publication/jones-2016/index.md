abstract: "Purpose of review Continuous wave near infrared spectroscopy (CW NIRS)\
  \ provides non-invasive technology to measure relative changes in oxy- and deoxy-haemoglobin\
  \ in a dynamic environment. This allows determination of local skeletal muscle O2\
  \ saturation, muscle oxygen consumption ( V\u02D9O2 ) and blood flow. This article\
  \ provides a brief overview of the use of CW NIRS to measure exercise-limiting factors\
  \ in skeletal muscle. Recent findings NIRS parameters that measure O2 delivery and\
  \ capacity to utilise O2 in the muscle have been developed based on response to\
  \ physiological interventions and exercise. NIRS has good reproducibility and agreement\
  \ with gold standard techniques and can be used in clinical populations where muscle\
  \ oxidative capacity or oxygen delivery (or both) are impaired. CW NIRS has limitations\
  \ including: the unknown contribution of myoglobin to the overall signals, the impact\
  \ of adipose tissue thickness, skin perfusion during exercise, and variations in\
  \ skin pigmentation. These, in the main, can be circumvented through appropriate\
  \ study design or measurement of absolute tissue saturation. Summary CW NIRS can\
  \ assess skeletal muscle O2 delivery and utilisation without the use of expensive\
  \ or invasive procedures and is useable in large population-based samples, including\
  \ older adults."
