abstract: "In summary, NIRS measurements of mitochondrial function can be made with\
  \ both VOL and ES exercises. The intensity of both ES and VOL exercises does not\
  \ influence the measurement of the recovery of mVO2. The recovery of mVO2 after\
  \ low- to moderate-intensity exercise appears to follow a monoexponential function,\
  \ and measurements can be made with reasonably small increases in mVO2. NIRS represents\
  \ an important new methodology for assessing muscle energetics, and future studies\
  \ should aim to apply NIRS measurements to various populations of interest. \xA9\
