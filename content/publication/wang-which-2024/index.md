abstract: Collaboration plays a crucial role in STEM education. This study aimed to
  investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the benefits of collaborative behaviors
  using fNIRS hyperscanning. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and right temporoparietal
  junction (r-TPJ) were targeted as regions of interest. Three key findings emerged
  from the analysis. First, IBS in the r-TPJ increased during the initial phases of
  collaboration, while IBS in the PFC increased during the later phases. Second, the
  frequency of scaffolding and questioning behaviors exhibited a significant positive
  correlation with the enhancement of IBS in the r-TPJ. Furthermore, the frequency
  of scaffolding behavior during the initial phases significantly correlated with
  task outcomes' fluency, integration, and technology scores. Overall, this study
  sheds light on the impact of different collaborative behaviors on IBS in different
  brain regions and task performance and proposes a new perspective on learning science
  using the brain-scanning method of fNIRS hyperscanning.
