abstract: "Cognitive training has been shown to result in improved behavioral performance\
  \ in normal aging and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), yet little is known about\
  \ the neural correlates of cognitive plasticity, or about individual differences\
  \ in responsiveness to cognitive training. In this study, 21 healthy older adults\
  \ and 14 patients with MCI received five weeks of adaptive computerized working-memory\
  \ (WM) training. Before and after training, functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy\
  \ (fNIRS) was used to assess the hemodynamic response in left and right prefrontal\
  \ cortex during performance of a verbal n-back task with varying levels of WM load.\
  \ After training, healthy older adults demonstrated decreased prefrontal activation\
  \ at high WM load, which may indicate increased processing efficiency. Although\
  \ MCI patients showed improved behavioral performance at low WM load after training,\
  \ no evidence was found for training-related changes in prefrontal activation. Whole-group\
  \ analyses showed that a relatively strong hemodynamic response at low WM load was\
  \ related to worse behavioral performance, while a relatively strong hemodynamic\
  \ response at high WM load was related to higher training gain. Therefore, a \u2018\
  youth-like' prefrontal activation pattern at older age may be associated with better\
  \ behavioral outcome and cognitive plasticity."
