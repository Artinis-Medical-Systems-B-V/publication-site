abstract: "Muscle oxygenation (MO) status is the dynamic balance between O2 utilization\
  \ and O2 delivery. Low-impact high-intensity interval exercise MO responses in the\
  \ exercise and recovery stage are still unclear. We compared the differences in\
  \ MO and physiological parameters between high-intensity interval water-based exercise\
  \ (WHIIE) and high-intensity interval land bike ergonomic exercise (LBEHIIE) in\
  \ postmenopausal women. Eleven postmenopausal women completed WHIIE or LBEHIIE in\
  \ counter-balanced order. Eight sets were performed and each exercise set included\
  \ high intensity with 80% heart rate reserve (HRR) in 30\_s and dynamic recovery\
  \ with 50% HRR in 90\_s. Muscle tissue oxygen saturation index (TSI), total hemoglobin\
  \ (tHb), oxy-hemoglobin (O2Hb), and deoxy-hemoglobin (HHb) were recorded. Blood\
  \ lactate, heart rate and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were measured at pre\
  \ and post-exercise. Under similar exercise intensity, RPE in WHIIE was lower than\
  \ that in LBEHIIE. The heart rate in WHIIE was lower than that in LBEHIIE at 1 and\
  \ 2\_min post-exercise. During the dynamic recovery, TSI, tHb, and O2Hb in water\
  \ were higher than on land. A negative correlation was found between the change\
  \ in TSI and lactate concentration (r = \u2212 0.664). WHIIE produced greater muscle\
  \ oxygenation during dynamic recovery. Muscle TSI% was inversely related to blood\
  \ lactate concentration during exercise in water."
