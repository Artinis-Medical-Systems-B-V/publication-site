abstract: "Background: Exercise can improve muscle function and mobility in people\
  \ with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the effects of exercise training on skeletal\
  \ muscle oxidative capacity and endurance in people with MS remain unclear, and\
  \ few studies have evaluated muscle plasticity in people with MS who have moderate-to-severe\
  \ disability. The present study evaluated the effects of treadmill training on muscle\
  \ oxidative capacity and muscle endurance and examined the relationship to walking\
  \ function in people with MS who have moderate-to-severe disability. Methods: Six\
  \ adults (mean \xB1 SD age, 50 \xB1 4.9 years) with MS (Expanded Disability Status\
  \ Scale score, 6.0-6.5) performed treadmill training for 24 minutes approximately\
  \ twice per week for approximately 8 weeks (16 sessions total) using an antigravity\
  \ treadmill system. The following measures were taken before and after the intervention\
  \ phase: muscle oxidative capacity in the medial gastrocnemius using near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy after 15 to 20 seconds of electrical stimulation; muscle endurance\
  \ in the medial gastrocnemius using accelerometer-based mechanomyography during\
  \ 9 minutes of twitch electrical stimulation in three stages (3 minutes per stage)\
  \ of increasing frequency (2, 4, and 6 Hz); and walking function using the 2-Minute\
  \ Walk Test. Results: Mean \xB1 SD muscle oxidative capacity increased from 0.64\
  \ \xB1 0.19 min-1 to 1.08 \xB1 0.52 min-1 (68.2%). Mean \xB1 SD muscle endurance\
  \ increased from 80.9% \xB1 15.2% to 91.5% \xB1 4.8% at 2 Hz, from 56.3% \xB1 20.1%\
  \ to 76.6% \xB1 15.8% at 4 Hz, and from 29.2% \xB1 13.1% to 53.9% \xB1 19.4% at\
  \ 6 Hz of stimulation in the gastrocnemius. There were no significant improvements\
  \ in walking function. Conclusions: Treadmill training can improve muscle oxidative\
  \ capacity and endurance in people with MS who have moderate-to-severe levels of\
  \ disability."
