abstract: "The purpose of this study was to review acute physiological responses induced\
  \ by repeated running sprint ability (RRSA) tests that could serve as references\
  \ for practitioners utilising repeated sprints as a performance measure with athletes.\
  \ This research was conducted following the PRISMA methodology. The systematic search\
  \ was conducted in November 2019 and yielded 26 different scientific articles. Only\
  \ peer-reviewed full-text article were included as abstracts are too short to allow\
  \ proper explanation of the RRSAT methodology that was employed. According to the\
  \ present literature, practitioners should use the following assessments: the 6\xD7\
  40m RRSA protocol with one Change of Direction (COD) (20+20 m with a 180\xB0 COD)\
  \ and 25s of passive recovery between sprints with soccer players; the Intensive\
  \ Repeated Sprint Ability (IRSA) test with men basketball players; the Futsal Intermittent\
  \ Endurance Test (FIET) with futsal players; the Repeated Shuttle Sprint Test (RSST)\
  \ with men handball players; and the Multiple Repeated Sprint Ability test for Badminton\
  \ players (MRSAB). The present review should serve as a reference standard for RRSA\
  \ tests. Further research should be directed towards creating and validating more\
  \ specific RRSA tests protocols to each sports physiological and physical demands."
