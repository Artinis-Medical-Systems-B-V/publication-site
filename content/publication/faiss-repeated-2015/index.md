abstract: "Purpose: Repeated-sprint training in hypoxia (RSH) was recently shown to\
  \ improve repeated-sprint ability (RSA) in cycling. This phenomenon is likely to\
  \ reflect fiber type-dependent, compensatory vasodilation, and therefore, our hypothesis\
  \ was that RSH is even more beneficial for activities involving upper body muscles,\
  \ such as double poling during cross-country skiing. Methods: In a double-blinded\
  \ fashion, 17 competitive cross-country skiers performed six sessions of repeated\
  \ sprints (each consisting of four sets of five 10-s sprints, with 20-s intervals\
  \ of recovery) either in normoxia (RSN, 300 m; FiO2, 20.9%; n = 8) or normobaric\
  \ hypoxia (RSH, 3000 m; FiO2, 13.8 %; n = 9). Before (pre) and after (post) training,\
  \ performance was evaluated with an RSA test (10-s all-out sprints-20-s recovery,\
  \ until peak power output declined by 30%) and a simulated team sprint (team sprint,\
  \ 3\xD73-min all-out with 3-min rest) on a double-poling ergometer. Triceps brachii\
  \ oxygenation was measured by near-infrared spectroscopy. Results: From pretraining\
  \ to posttraining, peak power output in the RSA was increased (P < 0.01) to the\
  \ same extent (29% \xB1 13% vs 26% \xB1 18%, nonsignificant) in RSH and in RSN whereas\
  \ the number of sprints performed was enhanced in RSH (10.9 \xB1 5.2 vs 17.1 \xB1\
  \ 6.8, P < 0.01) but not in RSN (11.6 T 5.3 vs 11.7 \xB1 4.3, nonsignificant). In\
  \ addition, the amplitude in total hemoglobin variations during sprints throughout\
  \ RSA rose more in RSH (P < 0.01). Similarly, the average power output during all\
  \ team sprints improved by 11% T 9% in RSH and 15% T 7% in RSN. Conclusions: Our\
  \ findings reveal greater improvement in the performance of repeated double-poling\
  \ sprints, together with larger variations in the perfusion of upper body muscles\
  \ in RSH compared with those in RSN."
