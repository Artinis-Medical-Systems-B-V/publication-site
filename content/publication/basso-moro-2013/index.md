abstract: "Encoding, storage and retrieval constitute three fundamental stages in\
  \ information processing and memory. They allow for the creation of new memory traces,\
  \ the maintenance and the consolidation of these traces over time, and the access\
  \ and recover of the stored information from short or long-term memory. Functional\
  \ near- infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that\
  \ measures concentration changes of oxygenated-hemoglobin (O2Hb) and deoxygenated-hemoglobin\
  \ (HHb) in cortical microcirculation blood vessels by means of the characteristic\
  \ absorption spectra of hemoglobin in the near-infrared range. In the present study,\
  \ we monitored, using a 16-channel fNIRS system, the hemodynamic response during\
  \ the encoding and retrieval processes (EP and RP, respectively) over the prefrontal\
  \ cortex (PFC) of 13 healthy subjects (27.2 \xB1 2.6 years) while were performing\
  \ the \u201CLogical Memory Test\u201D (LMT) of the Wechsler Memory Scale. A LMT-related\
  \ PFC activation was expected; specifically, it was hypothesized a neural dissociation\
  \ between EP and RP. The results showed a heterogeneous O2Hb/HHb response over the\
  \ mapped area during the EP and the RP, with a O2Hb progressive and prominent increment\
  \ in ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC) since the beginning of the EP. During the RP a broader\
  \ activation, including the VLPFC, the dorsolateral PFC and the frontopolar cortex,\
  \ was observed. This could be explained by the different contributions of the PFC\
  \ regions in the EP and the RP. Considering the fNIRS applicability for the hemodynamic\
  \ monitoring during the LMT performance, this study has demonstrated that fNIRS\
  \ could be utilized as a valuable clinical diagnostic tool, and that it has the\
  \ potential to be adopted in patients with cognitive disorders or slight working\
  \ memory deficits."
