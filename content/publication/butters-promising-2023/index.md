abstract: his systematic review aimed to evaluate previous studies which used near-infrared
  spectroscopy (NIRS) in dementia given its suitability as a diagnostic and investigative
  tool in this population. From 800 identified records which used NIRS in dementia
  and prodromal stages, 88 studies were evaluated which employed a range of tasks
  testing memory (29), word retrieval (24), motor (8) and visuo-spatial function (4),
  and which explored the resting state (32). Across these domains, dementia exhibited
  blunted haemodynamic responses, often localised to frontal regions of interest,
  and a lack of task-appropriate frontal lateralisation. Prodromal stages, such as
  mild cognitive impairment, revealed mixed results. Reduced cognitive performance
  accompanied by either diminished functional responses or hyperactivity was identified,
  the latter suggesting a compensatory response not present at the dementia stage.
  Despite clear evidence of alterations in brain oxygenation in dementia and prodromal
  stages, a consensus as to the nature of these changes is difficult to reach. This
  is likely partially due to the lack of standardisation in optical techniques and
  processing methods for the application of NIRS to dementia. Further studies are
  required exploring more naturalistic settings and a wider range of dementia subtypes.
