abstract: "Purpose: The purpose of the present study was to characterize hypothesized\
  \ relationships among fatigability and cardiorespiratory fitness in individuals\
  \ with chronic motor-incomplete SCI (iSCI) during treadmill walking. The theoretical\
  \ framework was that exacerbated fatigability would occur concomitantly with diminished\
  \ cardiorespiratory fitness in people with iSCI. Methods: Subjects with iSCI (n\_\
  =\_8) and an able-bodied reference group (REF) (n\_=\_8) completed a 6-min walking\
  \ bout followed by a walking bout of 30-min or until volitional exhaustion, both\
  \ at a self-selected walking speed. Fatigability was assessed using both perceived\
  \ fatigability and performance fatigability measures. Pulmonary oxygen uptake kinetics\
  \ (VO2 on-kinetics) was measured breath-by-breath and changes in deoxygenated hemoglobin/myoglobin\
  \ concentration (\u2206[HHb]) of the lateral gastrocnemius was measured by near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy. Adjustment of VO2 and \u2206[HHb] on-kinetics were modeled using\
  \ a mono-exponential equation. Results: Perceived fatigability and performance fatigability\
  \ were 52% and 44% greater in the iSCI group compared to the REF group (p\_=\_0.003\
  \ and p\_=\_0.004). Phase II time constant ($\u03C4$p) of VO2 on-kinetics and \u2206\
  [HHb] \xBD time during resting arterial occlusion were 55.4% and 16.3% slower in\
  \ iSCI vs REF (p\_<\_0.01 and p\_=\_0.047, respectively). Conclusions: The results\
  \ of the present study may suggest that compromised O2 delivery and/or utilization\
  \ may have contributed to the severity of fatigability in these individuals with\
  \ iSCI. The understanding of the extent to which fatigability and VO2 and $\u0394\
  $[HHb] on-kinetics impacts locomotion after iSCI will assist in the future development\
  \ of targeted interventions to enhance function."
