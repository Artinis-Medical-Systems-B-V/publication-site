 abstract = {Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) has been used to measure muscle mitochondrial capacity. The current method requires as many as 22 short ischemic occlusions to generate a recovery curve for mitochondrial capacity. PURPOSE: To determine the effectiveness of using a 6-occlusion analysis protocol to study muscle mitochondrial capacity. METHOD: Two independent, unidentified data sets were analyzed (bicep n=48, forearm n=41) from previous studies using a NIRS device (Artinis, Ltd.). Both data sets had two recovery tests that included 22 ischemic occlusions. A recovery rate used to indicate mitochondrial capacity was calculated two different ways (simultaneously). Each sample was analyzed with a MATLAB program; with a curve-fit for the 22 ischemic occlusions and curve matching for the first six ischemic cuffs and an end resting value. The two resulting rate constants were compared using correlations, both for the two data sets, good and bad fitting data, using the best 5 of 6 points for the 6 cuff approach. RESULTS: The rate constants were not significantly different between the 22 cmuff and 6 cuff for the total data sets: bicep (1.43+0.32min-1, 1.44+0.35min-1, p=0.56), forearm (1.94+0.42min-1, 1.95+0.44min-1, p=0.76). The average bicep rate constants, when compared to each other, had an equation of y=1.07x-0.09, R2=0.90. The average forearm rate constants, when compared to each other, had an equation of 0.98x+0.02, R2=0.93. CONCLUSIONS: The 6-Cuff analysis provided the same results as the longer 22-cuff. The 6-cuff approach is both shorter in time and uses less ischemic occlusion periods, increasing the practicality of the NIRS mitochondrial capacity test.},
