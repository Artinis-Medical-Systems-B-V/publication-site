abstract: 'Background Rectal distension increases regulatory burden to autonomic nervous
  system in the brain.  Purpose To determine the effect of rectal defecation on endurance
  performance and blood supply to the prefrontal brain and sub-navel regions of elite
  triathletes.  Methods Thirteen elite triathletes completed a cycling time trial
  (80% VO2max) under defecated and non-defecated conditions, using a counterbalanced
  crossover design. Oxygenation and blood distribution in prefrontal brain and sub-navel
  regions were monitored by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during cycling.  Results
  Defecation moderately decreased systolic blood pressure (−4 mmHg, p textless 0.05,
  d = 0.71), suggesting an alleviation of autonomic nervous activity. During the exercise
  trials, fatigue (cycling time to exhaustion) occurred when cerebral oxygenation
  decreased to ~ 5 % below baseline regardless of treatment conditions, suggesting
  a critical deoxygenation point for sustaining voluntary exertions. Cerebral blood
  (estimated by total hemoglobin) increased progressively throughout the entire exercise
  period. Defecation decreased sub-navel oxygenation levels below the non-defecated
  level, suggesting an increased sub-navel oxygen consumption. Exercise also decreased
  sub-navel blood distribution, with minimal difference between non-defecated and
  defecated conditions. Defecation improved blood pooling in the prefrontal brain
  during exercise (p textless 0.05) and enhanced cycling performance in triathletes
  (Non-defecated: 1624 ± 138 s vs. defecated: 1902 ± 163 s, d = 0.51, p textless 0.05).  Conclusion
  Our results suggest that improved exercise performance after defecation is associated
  with greater blood availability to compensate deoxygenation in the prefrontal brain
  region during exercise. Further investigation is needed to examine the role of increasing
  sub-navel oxygen consumption in the performance improvement after defecation.'
