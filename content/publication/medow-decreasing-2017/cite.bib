 abstract = {We measured changes in transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during 70° upright tilt in patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope (VVS, N = 20), postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS, N = 20), and healthy controls (N = 12) aged 15–27 years old. VVS was included if they fainted during testing within 5–15 min of upright tilt. We combined TCD and NIRS to obtain estimates of percent change in the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2), cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv), and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF). Over the course of 10 min of upright tilt, CBFv decreased from a baseline of 70 ± 5 to 63 ± 5 cm/sec in controls and 74 ± 3 to 64 ± 3 cm/sec in POTS while decreasing from 74 ± 4 to 44 ± 3 cm/sec in VVS. CMRO2 was unchanged in POTS and controls during tilt while OEF increased by 19 ± 3% and 15 ± 3%, respectively. CMRO2 decreased by 31 ± 3% in VVS during tilt while OEF only increased by 7 ± 3%. Oxyhemoglobin decreased by 1.1 ± 1.3 $μ$mol/kg brain tissue in controls, by 1.1 ± 1.3 $μ$mol/kg in POTS, and 11.1 ± 1.3 $μ$mol/kg in VVS. CBFv and CMRO2 fell steadily in VVS during upright tilt. The deficit in CMRO2 in VVS results from inadequate OEF in the face of greatly reduced CBF.},
