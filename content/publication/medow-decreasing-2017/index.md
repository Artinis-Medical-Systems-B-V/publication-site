abstract: "We measured changes in transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) and near infrared\
  \ spectroscopy (NIRS) during 70\xB0 upright tilt in patients with recurrent vasovagal\
  \ syncope (VVS, N\_=\_20), postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS, N\_=\_20), and healthy\
  \ controls (N\_=\_12) aged 15\u201327\_years old. VVS was included if they fainted\
  \ during testing within 5\u201315\_min of upright tilt. We combined TCD and NIRS\
  \ to obtain estimates of percent change in the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen\
  \ consumption (CMRO2), cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv), and oxygen extraction\
  \ fraction (OEF). Over the course of 10\_min of upright tilt, CBFv decreased from\
  \ a baseline of 70\_\xB1\_5 to 63\_\xB1\_5\_cm/sec in controls and 74\_\xB1\_3 to\
  \ 64\_\xB1\_3\_cm/sec in POTS while decreasing from 74\_\xB1\_4 to 44\_\xB1\_3\_\
  cm/sec in VVS. CMRO2 was unchanged in POTS and controls during tilt while OEF increased\
  \ by 19\_\xB1\_3% and 15\_\xB1\_3%, respectively. CMRO2 decreased by 31\_\xB1\_\
  3% in VVS during tilt while OEF only increased by 7\_\xB1\_3%. Oxyhemoglobin decreased\
  \ by 1.1\_\xB1\_1.3\_$\u03BC$mol/kg brain tissue in controls, by 1.1\_\xB1\_1.3\_\
  $\u03BC$mol/kg in POTS, and 11.1\_\xB1\_1.3\_$\u03BC$mol/kg in VVS. CBFv and CMRO2\
  \ fell steadily in VVS during upright tilt. The deficit in CMRO2 in VVS results\
  \ from inadequate OEF in the face of greatly reduced CBF."
