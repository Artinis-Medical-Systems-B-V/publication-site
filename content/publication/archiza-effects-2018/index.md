abstract: "This study was conducted to determine the effects of inspiratory muscle\
  \ training (IMT) on respiratory and peripheral muscles oxygenation during a maximal\
  \ exercise tolerance test and on repeated-sprint ability (RSA) performance in professional\
  \ women football players. Eighteen athletes were randomly assigned to one of the\
  \ following groups: SHAM (n\_=\_8) or IMT (n\_=\_10). After a maximal incremental\
  \ exercise test, all participants performed (on a different day) a time-to-exhaustion\
  \ (Tlim) test. Peripheral and respiratory muscles oxygenation by near-infrared spectroscopy,\
  \ breath-by-breath ventilatory and metabolic variables, and blood lactate concentration\
  \ were measured. The RSA test was performed on a grass field. After a 6\_week intervention,\
  \ all athletes were reevaluated. Both groups showed increases in inspiratory muscles\
  \ strength, exercise tolerance and RSA performance, however only the IMT group presented\
  \ lower deoxyhemoglobin and total hemoglobin blood concentrations on intercostal\
  \ muscles concomitantly to an increased oxyhemoglobin and total hemoglobin blood\
  \ concentrations on vastus lateralis muscle during Tlim. In conclusion, these results\
  \ may indicate the potential role of IMT to attenuate inspiratory muscles metaboreflex\
  \ and consequently improve oxygen and blood supply to limb muscles during high-intensity\
  \ exercise, with a potential impact on inspiratory muscle strength, exercise tolerance\
  \ and sprints performance in professional women football players."
