abstract: Objective Semantic verbal fluency (SVF) engages cognitive functions such
  as executive function, mental flexibility, and semantic memory. Left frontal and
  temporal lobes, particularly the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), are crucial
  for SVF. This study investigates SVF and associated neural processing in older adults
  with mild SVF impairment and the relationship between structural abnormalities in
  the left IFG and functional activation during SVF in those individuals. Methods
  Fifty-four elderly individuals with modest level of mild cognitive impairment whose
  global cognition were preserved to normal but exhibited mild SVF impairment were
  participated. Prefrontal oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) activation and frontal cortical thickness
  were collected from the participants using functional near-infrared spectroscopy
  (fNIRS) and brain MRI, respectively. We calculated the Î² coefficient of HbO2 activation
  induced by tasks, and performed correlation analysis between SVF induced HbO2 activation
  and cortical thickness in frontal areas. Results We observed increased prefrontal
  activation during SVF task compared to the resting and control task. The activation
  distinct to SVF was identified in the midline superior and left superior prefrontal
  regions (ptextless0.05). Correlation analysis revealed an inverse relationship between
  SVF-specific activation and cortical thickness in the left IFG, particularly in
  pars triangularis (r(54)=-0.304, p=0.025). Conclusion The study contributes to understanding
  the relationship between reduced cortical thickness in left IFG and increased functional
  activity in cognitively normal individuals with mild SVF impairment, providing implications
  on potential compensatory mechanisms for cognitive preservation.
