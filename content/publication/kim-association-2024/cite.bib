Semantic verbal fluency (SVF) engages cognitive functions such as executive function, mental flexibility, and semantic memory. Left frontal and temporal lobes, particularly the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), are crucial for SVF. This study investigates SVF and associated neural processing in older adults with mild SVF impairment and the relationship between structural abnormalities in the left IFG and functional activation during SVF in those individuals.
Methods
Fifty-four elderly individuals with modest level of mild cognitive impairment whose global cognition were preserved to normal but exhibited mild SVF impairment were participated. Prefrontal oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) activation and frontal cortical thickness were collected from the participants using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and brain MRI, respectively. We calculated the Î² coefficient of HbO2 activation induced by tasks, and performed correlation analysis between SVF induced HbO2 activation and cortical thickness in frontal areas.
Results
We observed increased prefrontal activation during SVF task compared to the resting and control task. The activation distinct to SVF was identified in the midline superior and left superior prefrontal regions (p\textless0.05). Correlation analysis revealed an inverse relationship between SVF-specific activation and cortical thickness in the left IFG, particularly in pars triangularis (r(54)=-0.304, p=0.025).
Conclusion
The study contributes to understanding the relationship between reduced cortical thickness in left IFG and increased functional activity in cognitively normal individuals with mild SVF impairment, providing implications on potential compensatory mechanisms for cognitive preservation.},
