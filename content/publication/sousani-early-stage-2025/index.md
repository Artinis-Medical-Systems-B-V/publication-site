abstract: Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
  impairs both motor and cognitive functions. Accurate detection of PD remains a major
  challenge, particularly at early stages when clinical symptoms are subtle. This
  study presents the first multimodal machine learning framework integrating functional
  near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data for
  early-stage PD detection during dual-task mobility assessments. Data were collected
  from 62 participants, including 28 people with PD and 34 age-matched controls, who
  performed the clinically recommended Timed Up and Go (TUG), Cognitive Dual-Task
  TUG (CDTUG), and Motor Dual-Task TUG (MDTUG) tests. This complex multimodal experimental
  design simultaneously captured brain activation and body motion under motor and
  cognitive dual-task conditions. Four machine learning models combined with two feature
  selection techniques were applied to unimodal and multimodal datasets. The multimodal
  approach achieved superior classification accuracy (96%) compared to fNIRS-only
  (87%) and IMU-only (95%) models. Key brain–body biomarkers were identified, including
  dorsolateral prefrontal and frontopolar cortex activations during dual tasks, alongside
  motor features such as turn, sit-to-stand, and stand-to-sit durations. These findings
  highlight the promise of combining brain and motion measures and complex functional
  mobility tests for early-stage PD detection and advance the development of non-invasive,
  AI-driven biomarker discovery frameworks.
