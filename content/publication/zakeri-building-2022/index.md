abstract: The use of collaborative robots (cobots) in the industrial setting has grown
  and continues to expand globally, especially in the context of the smart factory.
  Mistrust and stress results, as cobots don’t provide facial, auditory, and visual
  cues that workers normally use to predict behavior. For quantification of mental
  stress, physiological, behavioral and subjective measures are integrated, processed
  and analyzed in a smart factory lab setting. The impact on the human workers as
  mental stress and fatigue conditions are correlated with the task complexity, speed
  of work, length of collaborative task and cobot payload etc. Multimodal functional
  neuroimaging was used to record participants’ neural and cardiac activity, in addition
  to the standard subjective and behavioral measures as they collaborated with robots
  in multitasking contexts. Preliminary results show that task complexity is positively
  correlated with beta and gamma band power, left prefrontal cortex activation, and
  heart rate, while it is negatively correlated with alpha band power during task
  performance.
