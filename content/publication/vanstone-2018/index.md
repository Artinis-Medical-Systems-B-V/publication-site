abstract: Due to the value of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), adulteration has become
  an important issue in the industry, which has created demand for quick and inexpensive
  fraud detection testing. In contrast to many current food fraud detection methods,
  near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can be inexpensive and convenient by minimizing
  sample preparation and measurement times. In this study, we developed a method using
  NIRS and chemometrics to detect adulteration of EVOO with other edible oil types
  that does not require sample preparation and can be completed in less than 10 min.
  First, a single EVOO was adulterated with corn oil from 2.7% to 25% w/w. Spectra
  for the unadulterated sample and its adulterated counterparts were measured. A principal
  component analysis (PCA) scores plot showed separation between the adulterated mixtures
  and the unadulterated sample, which demonstrated that the developed method could
  detect as low as 2.7% w/w adulteration if an unadulterated sample of the oil in
  question is provided. To study adulteration detection without an unadulterated sample
  for reference, the spectra of unadulterated samples and samples adulterated with
  corn, sunflower, soybean, and canola oils were measured. A PCA with soft independent
  modelling of class analogy was used for adulteration detection. Lower limits of
  adulteration detection for corn, sunflower, soybean, and canola oils were found
  to be approximately 20%, 20%, 15%, and 10%, respectively. These results demonstrate
  that the developed method can be used to rapidly screen for adulterated olive oils.
