abstract: "Purpose: Previous work identified an asymmetry in tissue desaturation changes\
  \ in the left and right quadriceps muscles during on-ice skating at maximal speed\
  \ in males. The effect of changing race distance on the magnitude of desaturation\
  \ or leg asymmetry is unknown. Methods: Six elite male skaters (age = 23 \xB1 1.8\
  \ yr, height = 1.8 \xB1 0.1 m, mass = 80.1 \xB1 5.7 kg, midthigh skinfold thickness\
  \ = 7 \xB1 2 mm) and four elite female skaters (age = 21 \xB1 4 yr, height = 1.6\
  \ \xB1 0.1 m, mass = 65.2 \xB1 4.3 kg, midthigh skinfold thickness = 10 \xB1 1 mm)\
  \ were studied. Subjects completed time trials over three race distances. Blood\
  \ lactate concentration and O2 uptake measurements were combined with near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy measures of muscle oxygenation (TSI) and blood volume (tHb) in the\
  \ right and left vastus lateralis. Results: Neither race distance nor gender had\
  \ a significant effect on the magnitude of maximal muscle desaturation ($\u0394\
  $TSImax). Pattern of local changes in tHb during individual laps was dependent upon\
  \ subtle differences in skating technique used for the different race distances.\
  \ Linear regression analysis revealed asymmetry between the right and left leg desaturation\
  \ in males during the final stages of each race distance, but not in females. At\
  \ all race distances, local muscle desaturation reached maximal values much more\
  \ quickly than global V\u0307O2peak. Conclusion: The use of wearable near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy devices enabled measurement of muscle oxygenation during competitive\
  \ race simulation, thus providing unique insight into the effects of velocity and\
  \ technique changes on local muscle oxygenation. This may have implications for\
  \ training and race pacing in speed skating. \xA9 2012 by the American College of\
