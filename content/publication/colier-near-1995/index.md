abstract: "A short history of oximetry During the second half of the 19th century\
  \ it was discovered that blood cells contain a colouring substance whose spectrum\
  \ is influenced by various blood gases [Hoppe, 1862]. Stokes discovered that this\
  \ coloured substance was the oxygen carrier of the blood. Felix Hoppe-Seyler, a\
  \ German chemist, named the substance haemoglobin. He found that when shaking a\
  \ solution of haemoglobin with air this resulted in a spectral change. He called\
  \ the component responsible for this change \"oxyhaemoglobin\". In 1876 Karl von\
  \ Vierordt published the first study in which spectroscopy was used to study haemoglobin\
  \ in tissue. He found a transition from oxyhaemoglobin to deoxyhaemoglobin in the\
  \ tissue of the finger after the arm was fully occluded, a technique still practised\
  \ today to study oxygenation in muscles (refer to Figure 1.2 at page 16). At the\
  \ begining of the 20th century oximetry developed rapidly in Germany with scientists\
  \ like Nicolai [1932], Kramer [1934], Matthes [1942] and Gross. Last two scientists\
  \ mentioned were the first to use a wavelength region in the near infrared where\
  \ absorption was independent of the oxygenation status of blood and which could\
  \ therefore compensate for changes in blood volume, light scattering and tissue\
  \ thickness [Matthes et al. 1939]. Their instrumentation however was still very\
  \ bulky and not easy to use. The first portable instrument measuring haemoglobin\
  \ saturation in tissue accurately and automatically was built and described by Millikan\
  \ [1942]. He named the instrument an \"oximeter\". The sensor weighed 30 grams,\
  \ used two wavelengths and could be slipped over the subject's ear. To obtain arterial\
  \ saturation the ear was moderately heated, a method also used in later versions\
  \ of oximeters. Millikan's instrument had an accuracy of 3 to 5% at the higher end\
  \ of the scale ( \u2014 98% saturation) and an accuracy of 8% at the lower end of\
  \ the scale ($\u223C$50% saturation). The oximeter of Millikan was improved by Wood\
  \ and Geraci [1949]. Further developments on reflection oximetry were done by Brinkman\
  \ and Zijlstra. They developed the \"Cyclops\", a device measuring oxygen saturation\
  \ on the forehead of a subject [Brinkman et al. 1950]. In the following years, oximetry\
  \ was used more and more in clinical situations. The title of Zijlstra's thesis\
  \ [1951]: \"Fundamentals and applications of clinical oximetry\" indicated that\
  \ they were far ahead of their time. In the seventies two important findings contributed\
  \ to the development and clinical applicability of oximetry. The first was by Aoyagi,\
  \ who found that the variations in arterial blood volume could be used to obtain\
  \ a signal dependent only on arterial blood changes. With this knowledge the arterial\
  \ oxygen saturation of the blood could be measured [Aoyagi et al. 1974, Nakajima\
  \ et al. 1975]. This technique 10 Introduction was called pulse oximetry and has\
  \ been developed into a reliable and widely used method [Kelleher 1989]. The second\
  \ finding was by J\xF3bsis [1977] and was the beginning of near infrared spectroscopy\
