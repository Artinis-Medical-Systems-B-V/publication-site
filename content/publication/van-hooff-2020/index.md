abstract: 'Objectives: Approximately one in five professional cycling athletes will
  eventually develop a sport-related vascular problem. However, detecting such flow
  limitation is a diagnostic challenge as the sensitivity of the currently available
  standard diagnostic tools is limited. Methods: Here we present an athlete with exercise-induced
  pain and weakness of the left leg. During the physical examination, pulsations of
  the femoral artery were palpable but less prominent. He was analyzed in an ongoing
  research project aimed at improving methods detecting sport-related leg flow limitations.
  Results: During functional testing, the ankle-brachial index of the left leg was
  moderately lowered. However, results of near-infrared spectroscopy and pedal power
  measurements were largely abnormal suggesting a severe flow limitation. Conclusion:
  Combining post-exercise ankle-brachial index, near-infrared spectroscopy, and pedal
  power measurements as routine diagnostic functional testing suggested a severe arterial
  flow inflow limitation. Conventional diagnostics encompassing duplex-Doppler echography
  and magnetic resonance angiography confirmed a femoral artery occlusion. Clinical
  trial registration: https://www.trialregister.nl/ identifier is Trial NL8557.Abbreviations:
  NIRS: Near-Infrared Spectroscopy; PPM: Pedal Power Measurements; ABI: Ankle Brachial
  Index; PSV: Peak Systolic Velocity.'
