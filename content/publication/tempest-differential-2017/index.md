abstract: "The acute-exercise effects upon cognitive functions are varied and dependent\
  \ upon exercise duration and intensity, and the type of cognitive tasks assessed.\
  \ The hypofrontality hypothesis assumes that prolonged exercise, at physiologically\
  \ challenging intensities, is detrimental to executive functions due to cerebral\
  \ perturbations (indicated by reduced prefrontal activity). The present study aimed\
  \ to test this hypothesis by measuring oxygenation in prefrontal and motor regions\
  \ using near-infrared spectroscopy during two executive tasks (flanker task and\
  \ 2-back task) performed while cycling for 60\_min at a very low intensity and an\
  \ intensity above the ventilatory threshold. Findings revealed that, compared to\
  \ very low intensity, physiologically challenging exercise (i) shortened reaction\
  \ time in the flanker task, (ii) impaired performance in the 2-back task, and (iii)\
  \ initially increased oxygenation in prefrontal, but not motor regions, which then\
  \ became stable in both regions over time. Therefore, during prolonged exercise,\
  \ not only is the intensity of exercise assessed important, but also the nature\
  \ of the cognitive processes involved in the task. In contrast to the hypofrontality\
  \ hypothesis, no inverse pattern of oxygenation between prefrontal and motor regions\
  \ was observed, and prefrontal oxygenation was maintained over time. The present\
  \ results go against the hypofrontality hypothesis."
