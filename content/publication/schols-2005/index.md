abstract: "Impaired oxidative phosphorylation is a crucial factor in the pathogenesis\
  \ of Friedreich's ataxia (FA). L-carnitine and creatine are natural compounds that\
  \ can enhance cellular energy transduction. We performed a placebo-controlled triple-phase\
  \ crossover trial of L-carnitine (3 g/d) and creatine (6.75 g/d) in 16 patients\
  \ with genetically confirmed FA. Primary outcome measures were mitochondrial ATP\
  \ production measured as phosphocreatine recovery by 31Phosphorus magnetic resonance\
  \ spectroscopy, neurological deficits assessed by the international co-operative\
  \ ataxia rating scale and cardiac hypertrophy in echocardiography. After 4 months\
  \ on L-carnitine phosphocreatine recovery was improved compared to baseline (p<0.03,\
  \ t-test) but comparison to placebo and creatine effects did not reach significance\
  \ (p = 0.06, F-test). Ataxia rating scale and echocardiographic parameters remained\
  \ unchanged. Creatine had no effect in FA patients. L-carnitine is a promising substance\
  \ for the treatment of FA patients, and larger trials are warranted. \xA9 Springer-Verlag\
