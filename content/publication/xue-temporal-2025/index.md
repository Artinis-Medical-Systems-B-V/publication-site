abstract: Emotional multisensory integration is the process through which individuals
  form consistent emotional perceptions by combining information from various senses.
  Although this process has been well studied in early life and adulthood, limited
  attention was paid to its characteristics and neural mechanisms in preschoolers.
  This study utilized functional near-infrared spectroscopy to explore the mechanisms
  by which preschoolers recognize happiness and anger in visual, auditory, and audiovisual
  conditions. Behavioral results showed that children were more accurate and faster
  in the audiovisual condition, especially for anger recognition. Neuroimaging results
  revealed increased activation in bilateral superior temporal gyrus and the left
  middle temporal gyrus during audiovisual tasks. Furthermore, happiness elicited
  stronger cortical responses than anger, yet no evidence of hemispheric lateralization
  was found. These findings enhance our comprehension of how children integrate emotions
  in audiovisual contexts and suggest potential interventions for populations with
  emotional perception challenges.
