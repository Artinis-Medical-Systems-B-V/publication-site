abstract: "Fibromyalgia (FM) is a complex syndrome characterized by chronic widespread\
  \ pain and a heightened response to pressure. Most medical researches pointed out\
  \ that FM patients with endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness. A continuous-wave\
  \ near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) system is used in present study to measure the\
  \ hemodynamic changes elicited by breath-holding task in patients with FM. Each\
  \ patient completed a questionnaire survey including demographics, characteristics\
  \ of body pain, associated symptoms, headache profiles and Hospital Anxiety and\
  \ Depression Scale. A total of 27 FM patients and 26 health controls were enrolled.\
  \ In comparison with healthy controls, patients with FM showed lower maximal and\
  \ averaged change of oxyhemoglobin concentration in both the left (1.634 \xB10.890\
  \ and 0.810 \xB10.525 $\u03BC$M) and the right (1.576 \xB10.897 and 0.811 \xB10.601\
  \ $\u03BC$M) prefrontal cortex than healthy controls (P <.05 for both sides) during\
  \ the breath-holding task. In conclusion, FM is associated with altered cerebrovascular\
  \ reactivity measured by NIRS and breath-holding task, which may reflect endothelial\
  \ dysfunction or arterial stiffness. Oxygenated hemoglobin concentration changes\
  \ of healthy controls and FM patients."
