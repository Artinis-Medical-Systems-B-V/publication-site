abstract: Background Previous reports indicate that patients with Parkinson's disease
  (PD) activate the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during complex activities such as obstacle
  negotiation to compensate for impaired motor function. However, the influence of
  disease severity on PFC activation has not been systematically evaluated. Here,
  we examined the effects of disease severity on PFC activation during obstacle negotiation.  Methods
  74 patients with PD (age 68.26 Â± 7.54 yrs; 62.2% men) were divided into three groups
  based on Hoehn and Yahr stages. All patients walked along an obstacle course while
  negotiating anticipated and unanticipated obstacles (long/low available response
  time) at heights of 50 mm and 100 mm. PFC activation was measured using functional
  near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and was compared between groups and tasks using
  mixed model analyses.  Results Participants with more advanced PD (i.e., Hoehn &
  Yahr 3) had higher PFC activation levels when negotiating anticipated obstacles,
  compared to participants with milder PD (i.e., Hoehn & Yahr 1, 2) (p textless 0.001).
  Moreover, higher LEDD correlated with higher prefrontal activation during the higher
  anticipated obstacle. In contrast, during the negotiation of unanticipated obstacles,
  the differences in PFC activation were not associated with disease severity in a
  linear manner.  Conclusions The present study suggests that with increased disease
  severity, patients with PD rely more on the PFC when negotiating anticipated obstacles,
  perhaps to compensate for attention and motor deficits. These findings support the
  role of cognition in fall risk and the need to improve attention and cognition in
  fall prevention programs, especially among patients with more advanced disease.
