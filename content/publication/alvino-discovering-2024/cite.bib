 abstract = {This study expands the domain of neuromarketing (and/or consumer neuroscience) by providing an overview of the current state of the art and the future directions of neuromarketing research for digital, social, and mobile marketing. Using a scoping review, we analyse the use of neuroscience tools in different contexts, such as digital marketing, social media, and mobile marketing. We selected a total of 68 articles in the field. Our findings indicate that neuromarketing contributes to studying online advertising in areas such as effectiveness, persuasion, preferences, feature salience and user experience. We find that eye tracking and electroencephalography are the most used tools in neuromarketing research. Our findings also indicate that two new techniques are currently used to test online advertisements: voice analysis and breathing analysis.},
