abstract: 'This study expands the domain of neuromarketing (and/or consumer neuroscience)
  by providing an overview of the current state of the art and the future directions
  of neuromarketing research for digital, social, and mobile marketing. Using a scoping
  review, we analyse the use of neuroscience tools in different contexts, such as
  digital marketing, social media, and mobile marketing. We selected a total of 68
  articles in the field. Our findings indicate that neuromarketing contributes to
  studying online advertising in areas such as effectiveness, persuasion, preferences,
  feature salience and user experience. We find that eye tracking and electroencephalography
  are the most used tools in neuromarketing research. Our findings also indicate that
  two new techniques are currently used to test online advertisements: voice analysis
  and breathing analysis.'
