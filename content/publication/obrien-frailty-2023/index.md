abstract: 'Frailty is characterized by an increased vulnerability to adverse health
  events. Executive function impairment is an early sign of progression towards cognitive
  impairments. Whether frailty is associated with executive function and the associated
  mechanisms are unclear. We test the hypothesis that higher frailty is associated
  with worse executive function (Trail Making Test) and if aerobic fitness, prefrontal
  cortex oxygenation (ΔO2Hb), or middle-cerebral artery velocity (MCAv) impact this
  association. Forty-one (38 females) cognitively health older adults (70.1 ± 6.3
  years) completed a Trail task and 6-min walk test. Prefrontal cortex oxygenation
  was measured during the Trail task (via functional near-infrared spectroscopy) and
  MCAv in a sub-sample (n=26, via transcranial Doppler). A 35-item frailty index was
  used. Frailty was independently, non-linearly related to trail B performance (Frailty2:
  β=1927 [95% CI: 321–3533], p = 0.02), with the model explaining 22% of the variance
  of trail B time (p = 0.02). Aerobic fitness was an independent predictor of trail
  B (β=−0.05 [95% CI: −0.10–0.004], p = 0.04), but age and ΔO2Hb were not (both, p
  textgreater 0.78). Frailty was positively associated with the difference between
  trails B and A (β=105 [95% CI: 24–186], p = 0.01). Frailty was also associated with
  a higher peak MCAv (ρ = 0.40, p = 0.04), but lower ΔO2Hb-peakMCAv ratio (ρ = −0.44,
  p = 0.02). Higher frailty levels are associated to worse Trail times after controlling
  for age, aerobic fitness, and prefrontal oxygenation. High frailty level may disproportionately
  predispose older adults to challenges performing executive function tasks that may
  manifest early as a compensatory higher MCAv despite worse executive function, and
  indicate a greater risk of progressing to cognitive impairment.'
