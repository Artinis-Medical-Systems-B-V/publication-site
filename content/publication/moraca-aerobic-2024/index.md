abstract: 'Gait impairments negatively affect the quality of life of people with Parkinson’s
  disease (PwPD). Aerobic exercise (AE) is an alternative to alleviate these impairments
  and its combination with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has demonstrated
  synergistic effects. However, the effect of multitarget tDCS application (i.e.,
  motor, and prefrontal cortices simultaneously) combined with physical exercise on
  gait impairments is still little known. Thus, the proposed randomized clinical trial
  will verify the acute effects of AE combined with tDCS applied on motor and prefrontal
  cortices separately and simultaneously on gait (spatial-temporal and cortical activity
  parameters) in PwPD. Twenty-four PwPD in Hoehn & Yahr stages I-III will be recruited
  for this crossover study. PwPD will practice AE on treadmill simultaneously with
  the application of anodal tDCS during four intervention sessions on different days
  (∼ one week of interval). Active tDCS will be applied to the primary motor cortex,
  prefrontal cortex, and both areas simultaneously (multitarget), with an intensity
  of 2 mA for 20 min. For sham, the stimulation will remain at 2 mA for 10 s. The
  AE will last a total of 30 min, consisting of warm-up, main part (20 min with application
  of tDCS), and recovery. Exercise intensity will be controlled by heart rate. Spatial-temporal
  and cortical activity parameters will be acquired before and after each session
  during overground walking, walking with obstacle avoidance, and walking with a cognitive
  dual task at self-preferred velocity. An accelerometer will be positioned on the
  fifth lumbar vertebra to obtain the spatial-temporal parameters (i.e., step length,
  duration, velocity, and swing phase duration). Prefrontal cortex activity will be
  recorded from a portable functional near-infrared spectroscopy system and oxygenated
  and deoxygenated hemoglobin concentrations will be analyzed. Two-way ANOVAs with
  repeated measures for stimulation and moment will be performed. The findings of
  the study may contribute to improving gait in PwPD. Trial registration: Brazilian
  Clinical Trials Registry (RBR-738zkp7).'
