abstract: 'This study aimed to compare the oxidative capacity of resting skeletal
  muscle between experienced natural bodybuilders and untrained individuals, using
  near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Thirty-four male subjects participated voluntarily
  and were classified into two groups: 1) bodybuilding (n = 17; age: 24.3 ± 3.6 years,
  height: 180.1 ± 7.1 cm, body mass: 90.5 ± 9.3 kg), and 2) control (n = 17; age:
  21.8 ± 2.7 years, height: 176.7 ± 5.7 cm, body mass: 71.4 ± 10.3 kg). The muscle
  oxygen consumption (mVO2) of the vastus lateralis was measured using continuous-wave
  NIRS with transient arterial occlusions. The recovery rate of mVO2 was fitted to
  a mono-exponential curve with the time constant (TC) used as an index of muscle
  oxidative capacity. The TC obtained from the mono-exponential fit was significantly
  lower in the bodybuilding group (TC: 23.5 ± 7.1 s) compared to the control group
  (TC: 40.7 ± 8.3 s), indicating enhanced muscle oxidative capacity (p textless .001;
  effect size: 2.24). Additionally, initial end-exercise mVO2 values were significantly
  different between the bodybuilding group (3.5 ± 1.3% · s−1) and control group (2.5 ± 1.0%
  · s−1). The reduced TC observed in the natural bodybuilders group demonstrates that
  RT focused on enhancing muscle hypertrophy improves the muscle oxidative capacity.
  These findings provide valuable insights into metabolic adaptations induced by RT
  and underscore the utility of NIRS for assessing muscle oxidative capacity'
