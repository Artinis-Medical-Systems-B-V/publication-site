abstract: "PURPOSE: Previous studies have used near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to\
  \ measure skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity. This study tested the hypothesis\
  \ that NIRS-measured mitochondrial capacity would improve with endurance exercise\
  \ training and decline with detraining. METHODS: Nine young participants performed\
  \ 4 wk of progressively increasing endurance exercise training of the wrist flexor\
  \ muscles followed by approximately 5 wk of inactivity. The rate of recovery of\
  \ muscle oxygen consumption (mV\u0307O2) was measured with NIRS every 3-7 d, indicating\
  \ mitochondrial oxidative capacity. RESULTS: A linear increase in mitochondrial\
  \ capacity (NIRS rate constant) was found with a group average of 64% \xB1 37% improvement\
  \ after 4 wk of exercise training (P < 0.05). Mitochondrial capacity declined exponentially\
  \ upon cessation of exercise training, with a mean half-time of approximately 7.7\
  \ d. CONCLUSIONS: Both the magnitude and the time course of mitochondrial adaptations\
  \ to exercise training and detraining measured with NIRS was consistent with previous\
  \ studies using both in vitro and in vivo techniques. These findings show that NIRS-based\
  \ measurements can detect meaningful changes in mitochondrial capacity. Copyright\
