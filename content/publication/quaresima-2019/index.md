abstract: This mini-review is aimed at briefly summarizing the present status of functional
  near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and predicting where the technique should go
  in the next decade. This mini-review quotes 33 articles on the different fNIRS basics
  and technical developments and 44 reviews on the fNIRS applications published in
  the last eight years. The huge number of review articles about a wide spectrum of
  topics in the field of cognitive and social sciences, functional neuroimaging research,
  and medicine testifies to the maturity achieved by this non-invasive optical vascular-based
  functional neuroimaging technique. Today, fNIRS has started to be utilized on healthy
  subjects while moving freely in different naturalistic settings. Further instrumental
  developments are expected to be done in the near future to fully satisfy this latter
  important aspect. In addition, fNIRS procedures, including correction methods for
  the strong extracranial interferences, need to be standardized before using fNIRS
  as a clinical tool in individual patients. New research avenues such as interactive
  neurosciences, cortical activation modulated by different type of sport performance,
  and cortical activation during neurofeedback training are highlighted.
