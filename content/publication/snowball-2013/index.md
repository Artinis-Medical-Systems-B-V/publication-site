abstract: "Noninvasive brain stimulation has shown considerable promise for enhancing\
  \ cognitive functions by the long-term manipulation of neuroplasticity [1-3]. However,\
  \ the observation of such improvements has been focused at the behavioral level,\
  \ and enhancements largely restricted to the performance of basic tasks. Here, we\
  \ investigate whether transcranial random noise stimulation (TRNS) can improve learning\
  \ and subsequent performance on complex arithmetic tasks. TRNS of the bilateral\
  \ dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a key area in arithmetic [4, 5], was uniquely\
  \ coupled with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to measure online hemodynamic responses\
  \ within the prefrontal cortex. Five consecutive days of TRNS-accompanied cognitive\
  \ training enhanced the speed of both calculation- and memory-recall-based arithmetic\
  \ learning. These behavioral improvements were associated with defined hemodynamic\
  \ responses consistent with more efficient neurovascular coupling within the left\
  \ DLPFC. Testing 6 months after training revealed long-lasting behavioral and physiological\
  \ modifications in the stimulated group relative to sham controls for trained and\
  \ nontrained calculation material. These results demonstrate that, depending on\
  \ the learning regime, TRNS can induce long-term enhancement of cognitive and brain\
  \ functions. Such findings have significant implications for basic and translational\
  \ neuroscience, highlighting TRNS as a viable approach to enhancing learning and\
  \ high-level cognition by the long-term modulation of neuroplasticity. \xA9 2013\
