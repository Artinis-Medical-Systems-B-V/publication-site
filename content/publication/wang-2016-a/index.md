abstract: "Background To demonstrate the feasibility of using a susceptibility-based\
  \ MRI technique with asymmetric spin-echo (ASE) sequence to assess the lower extremity\
  \ muscle oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) alternations under cuff compression paradigm.\
  \ Methods Approved by the local institutional human study committee, nine healthy\
  \ young volunteers participated in this study. All the ASE scans were conducted\
  \ using a 3 Tesla clinical MRI scanner during resting state (pre), 1-3 min (post1)\
  \ and 3-5 min (post2) after a pressure of 50 mmHg above individual systolic blood\
  \ pressure imposed on the thigh. Moreover, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements\
  \ were performed on the same day under the same cuff compression protocol to verify\
  \ the accuracy of this susceptibility-based method. Results In all volunteers, the\
  \ mean MRI based OEF in gastrocnemius (GAS) muscle increased significantly from\
  \ 0.28 \xB1 0.02 (pre) to 0.31 \xB1 0.03 (post1, P < 0.05) and 0.31 \xB1 0.03 (post2,\
  \ P < 0.05). In addition, mean OEF in soleus (SOL) muscle went up from 0.31 \xB1\
  \ 0.01 (pre) to 0.33 \xB1 0.03 (post1, P = 0.14) and 0.37 \xB1 0.04 (post2, P <\
  \ 0.05). For comparison, NIRS measured 1-%HbO2 (percentage of deoxyhemoglobin concentration\
  \ within total hemoglobin) in GAS rose significantly from 0.29 \xB1 0.03 (pre) to\
  \ 0.31 \xB1 0.04 (post1, P < 0.05) and 0.31 \xB1 0.04 (post2, P < 0.05), which confirmed\
  \ the accuracy of the MRI-based OEF. Conclusion This susceptibility-based OEF quantification\
  \ technique together with cuff compression paradigm could provide a noninvasive,\
  \ quantifiable and effective tool for measuring skeletal muscle oxygenation."
