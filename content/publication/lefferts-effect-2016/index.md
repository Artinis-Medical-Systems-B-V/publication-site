abstract: "Exercise in hypoxia places added demands on the brain and cerebrovasculature\
  \ that can impact cognitive function. The purpose of this study was to investigate\
  \ the effect of acute hypoxia on cerebrovascular hemodynamics, markers of neuro-steroidal\
  \ modulation and brain-blood barrier (BBB) integrity, and cognition during exercise.\
  \ Thirty healthy participants (21\_\xB1\_4\_yrs., BMI 24.0\_\xB1\_2.6\_kg\_\u2219\
  \_m\u2212\_2; 15 men) were randomized to both a\_\u2248\_2.5\_h normoxic (FiO2 20.0%)\
  \ and hypoxic (FiO2 12.5%) condition on two separate days. After 1.25\_h, participants\
  \ underwent 10\_min of exercise-alone (cycling at 55% HRmax) and 15\_min of exercise\_\
  +\_cognitive testing. Prefrontal cortex (PFC) tissue oxygenation and middle cerebral\
  \ artery (MCA) mean blood velocity (MnV) were measured using near-infrared spectroscopy\
  \ and transcranial Doppler respectively at rest, during exercise-alone, and during\
  \ exercise\_+\_cognitive testing. Salivary levels of dehydroepiandosterone [DHEA],\
  \ DHEA-sulfate [DHEAS]) and neuron specific enolase (NSE) were measured pre and\
  \ post exercise. Cognition was assessed using standard metrics of accuracy and reaction\
  \ time (RT), and advanced metrics from drift-diffusion modeling across memory recognition,\
  \ N-Back and Flanker tasks. MCA MnV increased from rest to exercise (p\_<\_0.01)\
  \ and was unchanged with addition of cognitive testing during exercise in both normoxia\
  \ and hypoxia. PFC oxygenation increased during exercise (p\_<\_0.05) and was further\
  \ increased with addition of cognitive challenge in normoxia but decreased during\
  \ exercise in hypoxia (p\_<\_0.05) with further reductions occurring with addition\
  \ of cognitive tasks (p\_<\_0.05). DHEA and NSE increased and decreased post-exercise,\
  \ respectively, in both normoxia and hypoxia (p\_<\_0.01). Accuracy on cognitive\
  \ tasks was similar in normoxia compared to hypoxia, while RT was slower in hypoxia\
  \ vs normoxia across memory recognition (p\_<\_0.01) and Flanker tasks (p\_=\_0.04).\
  \ Drift-diffusion modeling suggested changes in memory RT were due to increases\
  \ in caution (p\_<\_0.01). Overall cognitive performance is maintained during exercise\
  \ in hypoxia concomitant with slower RT in select cognitive tasks and reduced oxygenation\
  \ in the PFC. These changes were accompanied by slight increases in neuro-steroidal\
  \ modulation but appear independent of changes in NSE, a biomarker of BBB integrity.\
  \ Maintained accuracy and select increases in RT during hypoxic exercise may be\
  \ related behavioral changes in caution."
