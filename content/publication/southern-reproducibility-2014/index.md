abstract: "The purpose of this study was to assess the reproducibility of resting\
  \ blood flow, resting oxygen consumption, and mitochondrial capacity in skeletal\
  \ muscle using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). We also determined the influence\
  \ of 2 exercise modalities (ergometer and rubber exercise bands) on the NIRS measurements.\
  \ Fifteen young, healthy participants (5 female, 10 male) were tested on 2 nonconsecutive\
  \ occasions within an 8-day period. The NIRS device was placed on the medial gastrocnemius.\
  \ Venous and arterial occlusions were performed to obtain blood flow and oxygen\
  \ consumption. A series of repeated arterial occlusions was used to measure the\
  \ recovery kinetics of muscle oxygen consumption after$\u223C$7-10 s of voluntary\
  \ plantar flexion exercise. Resting blood flow had mean coefficients of variation\
  \ (CV) of 42% and 38% for bands and ergometer, respectively, and resting metabolism\
  \ had mean CVs of 17% and 12% for bands and ergometer, respectively. The recovery\
  \ time constant of oxygen consumption (day 1 bands and ergometer: 23.2 \xB1 3.7\
  \ s, 27.6 \xB1 6.5 s, respectively; day 2 bands and ergometer: 25.5 \xB1 5.4 s,\
  \ 25.0 \xB1 4.9 s, respectively) had mean CVs of 10% and 11% for bands and ergometer,\
  \ respectively. We conclude that measurements of oxygen consumption and mitochondrial\
  \ capacity using NIRS can be obtained with good reproducibility."
