abstract: "The effect of prior exercise on pulmonary O2 uptake (V\u0307O2 p) and estimated\
  \ muscle capillary blood flow (Q\u0307m) kinetics during moderate-intensity, field-based\
  \ running was examined in 14 young adult men, presenting with either moderately\
  \ fast (16 s < $\u03C4$V\u0307O2 p < 30 s; MFK) or very fast V\u0307O 2 p kinetics\
  \ ($\u03C4$V\u0307O2 p < 16 s; VFK) (i.e., primary time constant, $\u03C4$V\u0307\
  O2 p). On four occasions, participants completed a square-wave protocol involving\
  \ two bouts of running at 90-95% of estimated lactate threshold (Mod1 and Mod2),\
  \ separated by 2 min of repeated supramaximal sprinting. V\u0307O2 p was measured\
  \ breath by breath, heart rate (HR) beat to beat, and vastus lateralis oxygenation\
  \ deoxy-hemoglobin/myoglobin concentration (deoxy-[Hb+Mb]) using near-infrared spectroscopy.\
  \ Mean response time of Q\u0307m (Q\u0307m MRT) was estimated by rearranging the\
  \ Fick equation, using V\u0307O2 p and deoxy-[Hb+Mb] as proxies of muscle O2 uptake\
  \ (V\u0307O2) and arteriovenous difference, respectively. HR, blood lactate concentration,\
  \ total hemoglobin, and Q\u0307m were elevated before Mod2 compared with Mod1 (all\
  \ P < 0.05). $\u03C4$V\u0307O2 p was shorter in VFK compared with MFK during Mod\
  \ 1 (13.1 \xB1 1.8 vs. 21.0 \xB1 2.5 s, P < 0.01), but not in Mod2 (12.9 \xB1 1.5\
  \ vs. 13.7 \xB1 3.8 s, P < 1.0). Q\u0307m MRT was shorter in VFK compared with MFK\
  \ in Mod1 (8.8 \xB1 1.9 vs. 17.0 \xB1 3.4 s, P < 0.01), but not in Mod 2 (10.1 \xB1\
  \ 1.8 vs. 10.5 \xB1 3.5 s, P = 1.0). During Mod2, HR kinetics were slowed, whereas\
  \ mean deoxy-[Hb+Mb] response time was unchanged. The difference in $\u03C4$V\u0307\
  O2 p between Mod1 and Mod2 was related to Q\u0307m MRT measured at Mod1 (r = 0.71,\
  \ P < 0.01). Present results suggest that local O2 delivery (i.e., Q\u0307m) may\
  \ be a factor contributing to the V\u0307O2 kinetic during the onset of moderate-intensity,\
  \ field-based running exercise, at least in subjects exhibiting moderately fast\
  \ V\u0307O 2 kinetics. Copyright \xA9 2009 the American Physiological Society."
