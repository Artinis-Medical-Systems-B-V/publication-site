abstract: Purpose This study examined the effect of 12 weeks of concurrent aerobic
  and resistance training on brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, neuromuscular
  performance and cerebral oxygenation on self-paced cycling exercise in previously
  untrained older men.   Methods Eight untrained healthy males aged 53–64 years performed
  a familiarisation and a pre-training self-paced cycling time trial before 12 weeks
  of exercise training which combined aerobic and resistance exercise. The self-paced
  cycling time trial comprised a 30 s maximal effort sprint for every 4.5 min of lower
  intensity pace for a total of 25 min. Upon completion of 12 weeks of training, a
  comparison of the pre-training trial analysed for serum BDNF, neuromuscular performance,
  and cerebral oxygenation was undertaken.   Results Serum BDNF decreased significantly
  from 10.02 ± 4.63 to 6.96 ± 3.56 ng/ml after 12 weeks of training. There was also
  attenuated physiological strain for a comparable self-paced cycling performance.
  Despite positive physiological responses during the time trial pacing strategy was
  not altered compared with pre training.   Conclusion BDNF decreases following 12
  weeks of concurrent training and might reflect neuroplasticity for this type of
  training stimulus. Exercise training in previously sedentary older men can result
  in a multitude of physical benefits, which may also confer a neuroprotective effect.
  However, specific training is required to improve pacing strategies in previously
  untrained older males.   Clinical trial registration  Australian New Zealand Clinical
  Trials Registry number ACTRN12622001477718 .
