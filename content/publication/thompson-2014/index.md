abstract: "Dietary inorganic nitrate supplementation causes physiological effects\
  \ which may enhance exercise tolerance. However it is not known whether nitrate\
  \ might alter cognitive function during exercise. In a double-blind, cross-over\
  \ study, sixteen subjects ingested either nitrate-rich beetroot juice or a placebo\
  \ and completed a continuous cycle exercise test involving 20. min stages at 50%\
  \ and 70% V\u0307O2peak and a final stage at 90% V\u0307O2peak until volitional\
  \ exhaustion. Cognitive tasks were completed before, during and after exercise.\
  \ In the dietary nitrate condition: plasma [nitrite] increased (p<. 0.01), systolic\
  \ blood pressure decreased (p< 0.05) and there was a trend for a reduced oxygen\
  \ uptake at 50% V\u0307O2peak. Tissue oxygenation improved across exercise intensities\
  \ and exercise tolerance was greater at 90% V\u0307O2peak (p< 0.05). Rating of perceived\
  \ exertion, energy levels and cognitive performance were similar between conditions\
  \ with mental fatigue being evident from 70% V\u0307O2peak onwards (p< 0.05). Dietary\
  \ nitrate supplementation enhanced short-term endurance exercise performance with\
  \ concomitant mental fatigue but did not improve cognitive performance post-fatigue.\
