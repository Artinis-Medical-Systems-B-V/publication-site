 abstract = {Dietary inorganic nitrate supplementation causes physiological effects which may enhance exercise tolerance. However it is not known whether nitrate might alter cognitive function during exercise. In a double-blind, cross-over study, sixteen subjects ingested either nitrate-rich beetroot juice or a placebo and completed a continuous cycle exercise test involving 20. min stages at 50% and 70% V̇O2peak and a final stage at 90% V̇O2peak until volitional exhaustion. Cognitive tasks were completed before, during and after exercise. In the dietary nitrate condition: plasma [nitrite] increased (p<. 0.01), systolic blood pressure decreased (p< 0.05) and there was a trend for a reduced oxygen uptake at 50% V̇O2peak. Tissue oxygenation improved across exercise intensities and exercise tolerance was greater at 90% V̇O2peak (p< 0.05). Rating of perceived exertion, energy levels and cognitive performance were similar between conditions with mental fatigue being evident from 70% V̇O2peak onwards (p< 0.05). Dietary nitrate supplementation enhanced short-term endurance exercise performance with concomitant mental fatigue but did not improve cognitive performance post-fatigue. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},
