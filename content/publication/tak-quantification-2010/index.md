abstract: "Estimation of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO 2) and cerebral\
  \ blood flow (CBF) is important to investigate the neurovascular coupling and physiological\
  \ components in blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals quantitatively.\
  \ Although there are methods that can determine CMRO 2 changes using functional\
  \ MRI (fMRI) or near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), current approaches require a\
  \ separate hypercapnia calibration process and have the potential to incur bias\
  \ in many assumed model parameters. In this paper, a novel method to estimate CMRO\
  \ 2 without hypercapnia is described using simultaneous measurements of NIRS and\
  \ fMRI. Specifically, an optimization framework is proposed that minimizes the differences\
  \ between the two forms of the relative CMRO 2-CBF coupling ratio from BOLD and\
  \ NIRS biophysical models, from which hypercapnia calibration and model parameters\
  \ are readily estimated. Based on the new methods, we found that group average CBF,\
  \ CMRO 2, cerebral blood volume (CBV), and BOLD changes within activation of the\
  \ primary motor cortex during a finger tapping task increased by 39.5 \xB1 21.4%,\
  \ 18.4 \xB1 8.7%, 12.9 \xB1 6.7%, and 0.5 \xB1 0.2%, respectively. The group average\
  \ estimated flow-metabolism coupling ratio was 2.38 \xB1 0.65 and the hypercapnia\
  \ parameter was 7.7 \xB1 1.7%. These values are within the range of values reported\
  \ from other literatures. Furthermore, the activation maps from CBF and CMRO 2 were\
  \ well localized on the primary motor cortex, which is the main target region of\
  \ the finger tapping task. \xA9 2010 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine."
