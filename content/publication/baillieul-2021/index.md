abstract: "To determine the effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP),\
  \ the gold standard treatment for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), on gait\
  \ control in severe OSAS patients. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group,\
  \ sham-controlled monocentric study in Grenoble Alpes University Hospital, France.\
  \ Gait parameters were recorded under single and dual-task conditions using a visuo-verbal\
  \ cognitive task (Stroop test), before and after the 8-week intervention period.\
  \ Stride-time variability, a marker of gait control, was the primary study endpoint.\
  \ Changes in the determinants of gait control were the main secondary outcomes.\
  \ ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: (NCT02345694). 24 patients [median (Q1; Q3)]: age:\
  \ 59.5 (46.3; 66.8) years, 87.5% male, body mass index: 28.2 (24.7; 29.8) kg. m\
  \ \u22122 , apnea\u2013hypopnea index: 51.6 (35.0; 61.4) events/h were randomized\
  \ to be treated by effective CPAP (n = 12) or by sham-CPAP (n = 12). A complete\
  \ case analysis was performed, using a mixed linear regression model. CPAP elicited\
  \ no significant improvement in stride-time variability compared to sham-CPAP. No\
  \ difference was found regarding the determinants of gait control. This study is\
  \ the first RCT to investigate the effects of CPAP on gait control. Eight weeks\
  \ of CPAP treatment did not improve gait control in severe non-obese OSAS patients.\
  \ These results substantiate the complex OSAS-neurocognitive function relationship."
