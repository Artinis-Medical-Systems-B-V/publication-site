abstract: "The aim was to investigate the potential differences in muscle (vastus\
  \ lateralis) and cerebral (prefrontal cortex) oxygenation levels as well as in the\
  \ number of repetitions and total work output between isokinetic eccentric and concentric\
  \ exercise at a moderate relative intensity until exhaustion. Ten recreationally\
  \ active young men underwent two isokinetic exercise sessions either concentric\
  \ or eccentric, one on each randomly selected leg. The protocols were performed\
  \ at 60\xC2\xB0/s and an intensity corresponding to 60% of the maximal voluntary\
  \ contraction (MVC) of each contraction type. Concentric torque was significantly\
  \ lower compared to eccentric torque in both peak values and at values corresponding\
  \ to 60% of MVC [230 \xC2\xB1 18 Nm vs. 276 \xC2\xB1 19 Nm (P = .014) and 137 \xC2\
  \xB1 12 Nm vs. 168 \xC2\xB1 11 Nm, respectively (P = .010)]. The participants performed\
  \ 40% more contractions during eccentric compared to concentric exercise [122 \xC2\
  \xB1 15 vs. 78 \xC2\xB1 7, respectively]. No differences were found in the levels\
  \ of oxyhaemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, total haemoglobin and tissue saturation index\
  \ when eccentric and eccentric exercise regimes were compared (all P textgreater\
  \ .05). Our results demonstrate that eccentric exercise of moderate intensity leads\
  \ to greater resistance to fatigue and more work output compared to concentric exercise,\
  \ despite the comparable muscle and cerebral oxygenation levels."
