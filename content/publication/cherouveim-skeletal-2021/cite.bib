 abstract = {The aim was to investigate the potential differences in muscle (vastus lateralis) and cerebral (prefrontal cortex) oxygenation levels as well as in the number of repetitions and total work output between isokinetic eccentric and concentric exercise at a moderate relative intensity until exhaustion. Ten recreationally active young men underwent two isokinetic exercise sessions either concentric or eccentric, one on each randomly selected leg. The protocols were performed at 60°/s and an intensity corresponding to 60% of the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of each contraction type. Concentric torque was significantly lower compared to eccentric torque in both peak values and at values corresponding to 60% of MVC [230 ± 18 Nm vs. 276 ± 19 Nm (P = .014) and 137 ± 12 Nm vs. 168 ± 11 Nm, respectively (P = .010)]. The participants performed 40% more contractions during eccentric compared to concentric exercise [122 ± 15 vs. 78 ± 7, respectively]. No differences were found in the levels of oxyhaemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, total haemoglobin and tissue saturation index when eccentric and eccentric exercise regimes were compared (all P \textgreater .05). Our results demonstrate that eccentric exercise of moderate intensity leads to greater resistance to fatigue and more work output compared to concentric exercise, despite the comparable muscle and cerebral oxygenation levels.},
