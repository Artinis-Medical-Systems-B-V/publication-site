abstract: "The purpose of this study was to determine if muscle blood flow during\
  \ walking exercise and postexercise recovery can be augmented through the application\
  \ of intermittent compression of the lower legs applied during the diastolic phase\
  \ of the cardiac cycle. Results from four conditions were assessed: no compression\
  \ (NoComp), compression during walking (ExComp), compression during postexercise\
  \ recovery (RecComp), and compression applied throughout (AllComp). Superficial\
  \ femoral artery (SFA) blood flow was measured (Doppler ultrasound) during rest\
  \ and postexercise recovery. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP, finger photoplethysmography)\
  \ was used to calculate vascular conductance as VC SFA flow/MAP. Near infrared spectroscopy\
  \ measured changes in oxygenated (O2Hb) and deoxygenated hemoglobin concentration\
  \ throughout the test. Compression during exercise increased SFA blood flow measured\
  \ over the first 15 s of postexercise recovery (AllComp: 532.2 123.1 mL/min; ExComp:\
  \ 529.8 99.2 mL/min) compared with NoComp (462.3 87.3 mL/min P 0.05) and corresponded\
  \ to increased VC (NoComp: 4.7 0.9 mL\u02D9min1\u02D9 mmHg1 versus ExComp: 5.5 1.0\
  \ mL\u02D9min1\u02D9mmHg1, P 0.05). Similarly, compression throughout postexercise\
  \ recovery also resulted in increased SFA flow (AllComp: 190.5 57.1 mL/min; RecComp:\
  \ 158.7 49.1 mL/min versus NoComp: 108.8 28.5 mL/min, P 0.05) and vascular conductance.\
  \ Muscle contractions during exercise reduced total hemoglobin with O2Hb comprising\
  \ $\u223C$57% of the observed reduction. Compression during exercise augmented this\
  \ reduction (P 0.05) with O2HB again comprising $\u223C$55% of the reduction. Total\
  \ hemoglobin was reduced with compression during postexercise recovery (P 0.05)\
  \ with O2Hb accounting for $\u223C$40% of this reduction. Results from this study\
  \ indicate that intermittent compression applied during walking and during postexercise\
  \ recovery enhanced vascular conductance during exercise and elevated postexercise\
  \ SFA blood flow and tissue oxygenation during recovery."
