abstract: We report the case of a 71-year-old woman diagnosed with giant cell arteritis
  with bilateral subclavian and axillary obstruction and severe arm claudication that
  occurred 3 months earlier and was nonregressed after corticosteroids. Before possible
  revascularization, the patient was initiated to a personalized home-based graded
  exercise program including walking, hand-bike pedaling and muscle strength training.
  During the 9 months of treatment, the patient progressively improved radial pressure
  values (10 to 85mmHg), hand temperature values by infrared-thermography (+2.1 °C),
  arm endurance and forearm muscle oxygenation by near-infrared spectroscopy.  Home-based
  graded exercise proved to be a noninvasive option for upper limb claudication.
