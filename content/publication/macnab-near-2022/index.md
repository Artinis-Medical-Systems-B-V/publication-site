abstract: Near infrared spectroscopy systems are relied on today as adjuncts to aid
  intensive care and guide intraoperative and anaesthetic management. Ongoing evolution
  has given these technologies increasing clinical relevance. The original pioneering
  work in newborn infants established a role for NIRS as a means of monitoring changes
  in brain blood volume and oxygenation relevant to their care. Studies in animal
  models established that the onset of spinal cord ischemia could be detected in real
  time; these led to the technology being applied as an adjunct to prevent spinal
  cord damage during various surgical procedures where compromised spinal cord perfusion
  is a risk. Technical advances and innovation now make sensitive real-time hemodynamic
  and oxygenation monitoring of the spinal cord feasible using an invasive system;
  this has the potential to provide adjunctive care able to optimize perfusion and
  oxygen delivery at the site of injury following acute spinal trauma. In future,
  further miniaturization of brain and spinal cord systems, incorporation of multimodal
  sensors, advanced software and combination with parallel technologies will continue
  to expand the clinical role of NIRS as a means of enabling clinicians to optimize
  care of the brain and spinal cord.
