abstract: "We examined the effects of hypoxia severity on peripheral versus central\
  \ determinants of exercise performance. Eight cyclists performed constant-load exercise\
  \ to exhaustion at various fractions of inspired O2 fraction (FIO2 0.21/0.15/0.10).\
  \ At task failure (pedal frequency < 70% target) arterial hypoxaemia was surreptitiously\
  \ reversed via acute O2 supplementation (FIO2=0.30) and subjects were encouraged\
  \ to continue exercising. Peripheral fatigue was assessed via changes in potentiated\
  \ quadriceps twitch force ($\u0394$ Qtw,pot) as measured pre- versus post-exercise\
  \ in response to supramaximal femoral nerve stimulation. At task failure in normoxia\
  \ (haemoglobin saturation (SpO2) \u223C94%, 656 \xB1 82 s) and moderate hypoxia\
  \ (SpO2 \u223C82%, 278 \xB1 16 s), hyperoxygenation had no significant effect on\
  \ prolonging endurance time. However, following task failure in severe hypoxia (SpO2\
  \ \u223C67%; 125 \xB1 6 s), hyperoxygenation elicited a significant prolongation\
  \ of time to exhaustion (171 \xB1 61%). The magnitude of $\u0394$ Qtw,pot at exhaustion\
  \ was not different among the three trials (-35% to -36%, P=0.8). Furthermore, quadriceps\
  \ integrated EMG, blood lactate, heart rate, and effort perceptions all rose significantly\
  \ throughout exercise, and to a similar extent at exhaustion following hyperoxygenation\
  \ at all levels of arterial oxygenation. Since hyperoxygenation prolonged exercise\
  \ time only in severe hypoxia, we repeated this trial and assessed peripheral fatigue\
  \ following task failure prior to hyperoxygenation (125 \xB1 6 s). Although Qtw,pot\
  \ was reduced from pre-exercise baseline (-23%; P < 0.01), peripheral fatigue was\
  \ substantially less (P < 0.01) than that observed at task failure in normoxia and\
  \ moderate hypoxia. We conclude that across the range of normoxia to severe hypoxia,\
  \ the major determinants of central motor output and exercise performance switches\
  \ from a predominantly peripheral origin of fatigue to a hypoxia-sensitive central\
  \ component of fatigue, probably involving brain hypoxic effects on effort perception.\
