abstract: ', "Stress assessment by means of heart rate derived from functional near-infrared
  spectroscopy," Abstract. Many studies have been carried out in order to detect and
  quantify the level of mental stress by means of different physiological signals.
  From the physiological point of view, stress promptly affects brain and cardiac
  function; therefore, stress can be assessed by analyzing the brain-and heart-related
  signals more efficiently. Signals produced by functional near-infrared spectroscopy
  (fNIRS) of the brain together with the heart rate (HR) are employed to assess the
  stress induced by the Montreal Imaging Stress Task. Two different versions of the
  HR are used in this study. The first one is the commonly used HR derived from the
  electrocardiogram (ECG) and is considered as the reference HR (RHR). The other is
  the HR computed from the fNIRS signal (EHR) by means of an effective combinational
  algorithm. fNIRS and ECG signals were simultaneously recorded from 10 volunteers,
  and EHR and RHR are derived from them, respectively. Our results showed a high degree
  of agreement [r > 0.9, BAR (Bland Altman ratio) <5%] between the two HR. A principal
  component analysis/support vector machine-based algorithm for stress classification
  is developed and applied to the three measurements of fNIRS, EHR, and RHR and a
  classification accuracy of 78.8%, 94.6%, and 62.2% were obtained for the three measurements,
  respectively. From these observations, it can be concluded that the EHR carries
  more useful information with regards to the mental stress than the RHR and fNIRS
  signals. Therefore, EHR can be used alone or in combination with the fNIRS signal
  for a more accurate and real-time stress detection and classification.'
