abstract: "Reviews on cardiovascular fitness and cognition in older adults suggest\
  \ that a higher level of cardiorespiratory fitness may protect the brain against\
  \ the effects of aging. Although studies reveal positive effects of cardiorespiratory\
  \ fitness on executive function, more research is needed to clarify the underlying\
  \ mechanisms of these effects in older adults. The aim of the current study was\
  \ to assess the association between cardiorespiratory fitness level, cerebral oxygenation,\
  \ and cognitive performance in older adults (OAs). Seventy-four OAs (68 \xB1 6.3\
  \ years) gave their written, informed consent to participate in the study. Complete\
  \ data was collected from 66 participants. All participants underwent a cycle ergometer\
  \ maximal continuous graded exercise test in order to assess their peak power output\
  \ (PPO) and a neuropsychological paper and pencil tests (Trail Making Test A and\
  \ B) while changes in left prefrontal cortex oxygenation were measured with functional\
  \ near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The results reveal increased cardiorespiratory\
  \ fitness was associated with decreased response time (i.e., better performance)\
  \ on the Trail Making Test (B) (standardized $\u03B2$ = \u2212 0.42, p < 0.05).\
  \ Cerebral oxygenation in higher fit older adults mediated the relationship with\
  \ improved executive functioning (standardized $\u03B2$ = \u2212 0.08, p < 0.05).\
  \ Specifically, in older adults with higher cardiorespiratory fitness (based on\
  \ a median split), cerebral oxygenation was related to executive functioning but\
  \ no such relationship existed in lower fit adults."
