abstract: "Degradation of striatal dopamine in Parkinson's disease (PD) may initially\
  \ be supplemented by increased cognitive control mediated by cholinergic mechanisms.\
  \ Shift to cognitive control of walking can be quantified by prefrontal cortex activation.\
  \ Levodopa improves certain aspects of gait and worsens others, and cholinergic\
  \ augmentation influence on gait and prefrontal cortex activity remains unclear.\
  \ This study examined dopaminergic and cholinergic influence on gait and prefrontal\
  \ cortex activity while walking in PD. A single-site, randomized, double-blind crossover\
  \ trial examined effects of levodopa and donepezil in PD. Twenty PD participants\
  \ were randomized, and 19 completed the trial. Participants were randomized to either\
  \ levodopa + donepezil (5 mg) or levodopa + placebo treatments, with 2 weeks with\
  \ treatment and a 2-week washout. The primary outcome was change in prefrontal cortex\
  \ activity while walking, and secondary outcomes were change in gait and dual-task\
  \ performance and attention. Levodopa decreased prefrontal cortex activity compared\
  \ with off medication (effect size, \u22120.51), whereas the addition of donepezil\
  \ reversed this decrease. Gait speed and stride length under single- and dual-task\
  \ conditions improved with combined donepezil and levodopa compared with off medication\
  \ (effect size, 1 for gait speed and 0.75 for stride length). Dual-task reaction\
  \ time was quicker with levodopa compared with off medication (effect size, \u2212\
  0.87), and accuracy improved with combined donepezil and levodopa (effect size,\
  \ 0.47). Cholinergic therapy, specifically donepezil 5 mg/day for 2 weeks, can alter\
  \ prefrontal cortex activity when walking and improve secondary cognitive task accuracy\
  \ and gait in PD. Further studies will investigate whether higher prefrontal cortex\
  \ activity while walking is associated with gait changes. \xA9 2020 International\
