abstract: Freezing of gait, characterized by involuntary interruptions of walking,
  is a debilitating motor symptom of Parkinson's disease that restricts people's autonomy.
  Previous brain imaging studies investigating the mechanisms underlying freezing
  were restricted to scan people in supine positions and yielded conflicting theories
  regarding the role of the supplementary motor area and other cortical regions. We
  used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate cortical haemodynamics
  related to freezing in freely moving people. We measured functional near-infrared
  spectroscopy activity over multiple motor-related cortical areas in 23 persons with
  Parkinson's disease who experienced daily freezing (‘freezers’) and 22 age-matched
  controls during freezing-provoking tasks including turning and doorway passing,
  voluntary stops and actual freezing. Crucially, we corrected the measured signals
  for confounds of walking. We first compared cortical activity between freezers and
  controls during freezing-provoking tasks without freezing (i.e. turning and doorway
  passing) and during stops. Secondly, within the freezers, we compared cortical activity
  between freezing, stopping and freezing-provoking tasks without freezing. First,
  we show that turning and doorway passing (without freezing) resemble cortical activity
  during stopping in both groups involving activation of the supplementary motor area
  and prefrontal cortex, areas known for their role in inhibiting actions. During
  these freezing-provoking tasks, the freezers displayed higher activity in the premotor
  areas than controls. Secondly, we show that, during actual freezing events, activity
  in the prefrontal cortex was lower than during voluntary stopping. The cortical
  relation between the freezing-provoking tasks (turning and doorway passing) and
  stopping may explain their susceptibility to trigger freezing by activating a stopping
  mechanism. Besides, the stopping-related activity of the supplementary motor area
  and prefrontal cortex seems to be out of balance in freezers. In this paper, we
  postulate that freezing results from a paroxysmal imbalance between the supplementary
  motor area and prefrontal cortex, thereby extending upon the current role of the
  supplementary motor area in freezing pathophysiology.
