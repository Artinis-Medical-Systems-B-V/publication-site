abstract: Background Children with ADHD demand for effective intervention with minimum
  side effect to improve executive function (EF) and health well-being. Method This
  study used a three-arm partially-blinded randomized controlled trial to test the
  effects of two different kinds of 8-week game-based training programs (game-based
  HIIT program, GameHIIT; and game-based structured aerobic exercise program, GameSAE)
  on EF and other health indicators of children with ADHD, which was compared with
  a non-treatment control group. Results A total of 49 children with ADHD completed
  the program. Analyses of EF tests and parental survey indicated that (i) there is
  no significant intragroup difference among all measures between pre-/post-intervention
  tests for two game-based intervention groups. The only significant intergroup difference
  was observed in self-monitor score of parent-reported child's EF between GameSAE
  group and the control (large effect). Similarly, cerebral hemodynamic responses
  also found no significant group effect for all EF tests. However, the time effects
  were observed in several channels in the GameHIIT group in two EF tests (Color Words
  Stroop Test and Tower of London Test). No significant change of participants' overall
  ADHD symptoms was found in the pre-/post-tests for three groups. Nonetheless, further
  analyses revealed that both of two game-based training programs exhibited the significant
  positive effects on child's PA levels and the large effects on levels of physical
  fitness, when they were compared to the control. Conclusion By this study, a significant
  enhancement in physical fitness and PA levels were found in both game-based PA interventions
  when they were compared with control group. However, the effectiveness of game-based
  PA interventions on improving EF or reducing ADHD symptoms remains unclear. This
  implies that a larger intervention dosage or a tailored intervention design may
  be warranted to improve the EF of children with ADHD.
