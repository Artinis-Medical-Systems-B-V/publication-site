abstract: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been explored as a potential
  method for cognitive enhancement. tDCS may induce a cascade of neurophysiological
  changes including alterations in cerebral oxygenation. However, the effects of tDCS
  on the cognitive-cerebral oxygenation interaction remains unclear. Further, oxygenation
  variability across individuals remains minimally controlled for. The purpose of
  this sham-controlled study was to test the effects of anodal tDCS over the right
  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on the interaction between working memory
  and cerebral oxygenation while controlling for individual oxygenation variability.
  Thirty-three adults received resting-state functional near-infrared spectroscopy
  (fNIRS) recordings over bilateral prefrontal cortices. Following this, working memory
  was tested using a Toulouse n-back task concurrently paired with fNIRS, with measurements
  taken before and after 20 min of anodal or sham tDCS at 1.5 mA. With individual
  oxygenation controlled for, anodal tDCS was found to increase the oxyhemoglobin
  concentration over the right DLPFC during the 2-back (q = .015) and 3-back (q =
  .008) conditions. Additionally, anodal tDCS was found to improve accuracy during
  the 3-back task by 13.4 % (p = .028) and decrease latency by 250 ms (p = .013).
  The increase in oxyhemoglobin was strongly correlated with increases in accuracy
  (p = .041) and decreases in latency during the 3-back span (p = .017). Taken together,
  anodal tDCS over the right DLPFC was found to regionally increase oxyhemoglobin
  concentrations and improve working memory performance in higher cognitive load conditions.
