abstract: Paramedic work can be stressful. Encountering clinically unwell patients,
  long shift hours and dealing with the unknown expose paramedics to mental, physical
  and emotional stress. In the learning environment, these types of stresses are difficult
  for educators to replicate. Traditionally, students have been tested under pressure
  in scenario-based situations as a means of stress inoculation. However, the literature
  is unclear as to whether this enhances or hinders learning. A recent scoping review
  identified an acceptable level of stress during simulation can be beneficial, although
  a level of a balance is required. Too much stress can hinder learning and lead to
  underperformance. Ideally, high-acuity patient scenarios should be designed to invoke
  a challenging state of appraisal in the student to support both their learning and
  knowledge retention. To obtain an understanding of how students appraise these types
  of scenarios, quantitative physiological and psychometric data needs to be obtained
  and analyzed. However, across the health care education literature, inconsistent
  methodologies and a variety of physiological and cognitive measures make it challenging
  to draw firm conclusions. This narrative review searched three prominent databases
  using common search terms to produce a subset of high-quality publications that
  we thought were most pertinent and insightful. Our paper establishes recommendations
  for appropriate physiological assessment and interpterion of challenge appraisal
  in students undertaking high-stress, low-frequency clinical scenarios.
