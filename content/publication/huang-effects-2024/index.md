abstract: 'Erythrocyte rheological properties contribute to the dynamic regulation
  of vascular resistance to flow shear force, facilitating blood delivery from the
  heart to peripheral tissues. Despite improved physical performance, the effects
  of eccentric cycling training (ECT) on erythrocyte rheological characteristics remain
  unclear. This study investigates the distinct effects of ECT and concentric cycling
  training (CCT) on muscular hemodynamic and erythrocyte rheological responses to
  exercise. Thirty‐nine sedentary healthy males were randomly assigned to either ECT
  (n = 13) or CCT (n = 13) at 45%–70% of the maximal workload for 30 min/day, 5 days/week
  for 6 weeks, or to a control group (n = 13) that did not receive any exercise intervention.
  A graded exercise test (GXT) was performed before and after the intervention. Muscular
  hemodynamic and erythrocyte rheological responses to the GXT were determined by
  near‐infrared spectroscopy and ektacytometry, respectively. Both ECT and CCT significantly
  enhanced perfusion (Δ[THb]VL) and O2 extraction (Δ[HHb]VL) in vastus lateralis during
  GXT. Before training, an acute GXT significantly reduced erythrocyte deformability
  and increased aggregability, whereas after 6 weeks of either ECT or CCT, the extent
  of erythrocyte rheological changes caused by GXT was diminished. Moreover, CCT elicited
  higher improvements in cardiac output (CO), VO2, and work‐rate at peak performance
  than ECT. In hierarchical regression, the change of maximal CO was the most influential
  factor affecting VO2max following CCT. In contrast, enhanced VO2max was significantly
  associated with Δ[HHb]VL and erythrocyte aggregability/deformability in ECT. Although
  CCT is superior to ECT for increasing aerobic capacity, either ECT or CCT effectively
  enhances aerobic efficiency by improving muscular hemodynamic and erythrocyte rheological
  responses to exercise. Highlights: Although concentric cycling training (CCT) is
  superior to eccentric cycling training (ECT) for increasing aerobic capacity, the
  two regimens effectively enhance aerobic efficiency by improving hemodynamic or/and
  hemorheological response(s) to exercise. ECT increases blood O2 delivery to and
  utilization by contracting muscles, while having lower exertional cardiovascular
  demand compared to CCT. Cardiac hemodynamic function is the most dominant factor
  affecting the change of aerobic capacity caused by CCT. Muscular hemodynamic and
  erythrocyte rheological functions are meaningfully associated with aerobic efficiency
  mediated by ECT.'
