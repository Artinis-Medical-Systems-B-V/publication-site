abstract: "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with a high incidence of ischemic\
  \ stroke. SCD is characterized by hemolytic anemia, resulting in reduced nitric\
  \ oxide-bioavailability, and by impaired cerebrovascular hemodynamics. Cerebrovascular\
  \ CO2 responsiveness is nitric oxide dependent and has been related to an increased\
  \ stroke risk in microvascular diseases. We questioned whether cerebrovascular CO2\
  \ responsiveness is impaired in SCD and related to hemolytic anemia. Transcranial\
  \ Doppler-determined mean cerebral blood flow velocity (Vmean), near-infrared spectroscopy-determined\
  \ cerebral oxygenation, and end-tidal CO2 tension were monitored during normocapnia\
  \ and hypercapnia in 23 patients and 16 control subjects. Cerebrovascular CO2 responsiveness\
  \ was quantified as $\u0394$% Vmean and $\u0394$$\u03BC$mol/L cerebral oxyhemoglobin,\
  \ deoxyhemoglobin, and total hemoglobin per mm Hg change in end-tidal CO 2 tension.\
  \ Both ways of measurements revealed lower cerebrovascular CO2 responsiveness in\
  \ SCD patients versus controls (Vmean, 3.7, 3.1-4.7 vs 5.9, 4.6-6.7 $\u0394$% Vmean\
  \ per mm Hg, P < .001; oxyhemoglobin, 0.36, 0.14-0.82 vs 0.78, 0.61-1.22 $\u0394\
  $$\u03BC$mol/L per mm Hg, P = .025; deoxyhemoglobin, 0.35, 0.14-0.67 vs 0.58, 0.41-0.86\
  \ $\u0394$$\u03BC$mol/L per mm Hg, P = .033; total-hemoglobin, 0.13, 0.02-0.18 vs\
  \ 0.23, 0.13-0.38 $\u0394$$\u03BC$mol/L per mm Hg, P = .038). Cerebrovascular CO2\
  \ responsiveness was not related to markers of hemolytic anemia. In SCD patients,\
  \ impaired cerebrovascular CO2 responsiveness reflects reduced cerebrovascular reserve\
  \ capacity, which may play a role in pathophysiology of stroke. \xA9 2009 by The\
