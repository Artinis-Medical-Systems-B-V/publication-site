abstract: "Surgical ACL reconstruction performed with a tourniquet induces compression\
  \ and ischemic stress of the quadriceps femoris (QF) muscle which can accelerate\
  \ postoperative weakness. Given that low-load blood flow restricted (BFR) exercise\
  \ is potent in enhancing muscle oxygenation and vascular function, we hypothesized\
  \ that short-term preconditioning with low-load BFR exercise can attenuate QF muscle\
  \ endurance deterioration in the postoperative period. Twenty subjects undergoing\
  \ arthroscopic ACL reconstruction performed 5 exercise sessions in the last 8 days\
  \ prior to surgery. They were assigned into either BFR group, performing low-load\
  \ BFR knee-extension exercise, or SHAM-BFR group, replicating equal training volume\
  \ with sham occlusion. Blood flow (near-infrared spectroscopy) and surface EMG of\
  \ QF muscle during sustained isometric contraction at 30% of maximal voluntary isometric\
  \ contraction (MVIC) torque performed to volitional failure were measured prior\
  \ to the intervention and again 4 and 12 weeks after surgery. There was an overall\
  \ decrease (p = 0.033) in MVIC torque over time, however, no significant time-group\
  \ interaction was found. The time of sustained QF contraction shortened (p = 0.002)\
  \ in SHAM-BFR group by 97 \xB1 85 s at week 4 and returned to preoperative values\
  \ at week 12. No change in the time of sustained contraction was detected in BFR\
  \ group at any time point after surgery. RMS EMG amplitude increased (p = 0.009)\
  \ by 54 \xB1 58% at week 4 after surgery in BFR group only. BFm increased (p = 0.004)\
  \ by 52 \xB1 47% in BFR group, and decreased (p = 0.023) by 32 \xB1 19% in SHAM-BFR\
  \ group at week 4 after surgery. Multivariate regression models of postoperative\
  \ changes in time of sustained QF contraction revealed its high correlation (R2\
  \ = 0.838; p < 0.001) with changes in BFm and RMS EMG in the SHAM-BFR group, whereas\
  \ no such association was found in the BFR group. In conclusion, enhanced endurance\
  \ of QF muscle was triggered by combination of augmented muscle fiber recruitment\
  \ and enhanced muscle perfusion. The latter alludes to a preserving effect of preconditioning\
  \ with BFR exercise on density and function of QF muscle microcirculation within\
  \ the first 4 weeks after ACL reconstruction."
