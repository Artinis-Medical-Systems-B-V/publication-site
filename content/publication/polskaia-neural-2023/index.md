abstract: The current study used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to
  examine cerebral oxygenation changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) associated with
  dual-task processing before and after motor sequence learning. Participants performed
  self-initiated sequential finger movements that were 4 and 12 units in length with
  a visual letter-counting task. After practice, dual-task sequence-4 performance
  revealed decreased activity in the right dorsolateral PFC, medial PFC, and orbitofrontal
  cortex. However, dual-task sequence-12 performance revealed increased activity in
  the right ventrolateral PFC when compared to the left hemisphere. The findings suggest
  that dual-task interference was reduced following practice for dual-task sequence-4.
  The results also suggest that increased right hemisphere activation is needed to
  maintain performance when the primary sequential task (e.g., dual-task sequence-12)
  has a high level of difficulty.
