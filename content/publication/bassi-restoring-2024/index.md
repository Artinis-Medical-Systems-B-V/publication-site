abstract: Background In critically ill patients, deep sedation and mechanical ventilation
  suppress the brain-diaphragm-lung axis and are associated with cognitive issues
  in survivors. Methods This exploratory crossover design study investigates whether
  phrenic nerve stimulation can enhance brain activity and connectivity in six deeply
  sedated, mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.
  Results Our findings indicate that adding phrenic stimulation on top of invasive
  mechanical ventilation in deeply sedated, critically ill, moderate acute respiratory
  distress syndrome patients increases cortical activity, connectivity, and synchronization
  in the frontal-temporal-parietal cortices. Conclusions Adding phrenic stimulation
  on top of invasive mechanical ventilation in deeply sedated, critically ill, moderate
  acute respiratory distress syndrome patients increases cortical activity, connectivity,
  and synchronization. The observed changes resemble those during diaphragmatic breathing
  in awake humans. These results suggest that phrenic nerve stimulation has the potential
  to restore the brain-diaphragm-lung crosstalk when it has been shut down or impaired
  by mechanical ventilation and sedation. Further research should evaluate the clinical
  significance of these results.
