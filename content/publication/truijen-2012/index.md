abstract: "Standing up shifts blood to dependent parts of the body, and blood vessels\
  \ in the leg become filled. The orthostatic blood volume accumulation in the small\
  \ vessels is relatively unknown, although these may contribute significantly. We\
  \ hypothesized that in healthy humans exposed to the upright posture, volume accumulation\
  \ in small blood vessels contributes significantly to the total fluid volume accumulated\
  \ in the legs. Considering that near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) tracks postural\
  \ blood volume changes within the small blood vessels of the lower leg, we evaluated\
  \ the NIRS-determined changes in oxygenated ($\u0394$[O2Hb]), deoxygenated ($\u0394\
  $[HHb]) and total haemoglobin tissue concentration ($\u0394$[tHb]) and in total\
  \ leg volume by strain-gauge plethysmography during 70 deg head-up tilt (HUT; n=\
  \ 7). In a second experiment, spatial and temporal reproducibility were evaluated\
  \ with three NIRS probes applied on two separate days (n= 8). In response to HUT,\
  \ an initially fast increase in [O2Hb] was followed by a gradual decline, while\
  \ [HHb] increased continuously. The increase in [tHb] during HUT was closely related\
  \ to the increase in total leg volume (r2= 0.95 \xB1 0.03). After tilt back, [O2Hb]\
  \ declined below and [HHb] remained above baseline, whereas all NIRS signals gradually\
  \ returned to baseline. Spatial heterogeneity was observed, and for two probes [tHb]\
  \ was highly correlated between days (r2= 0.92 \xB1 0.09 and 0.91 \xB1 0.12), but\
  \ less for the third probe (r2= 0.44 \xB1 0.36). The results suggest a non-linear\
  \ accumulation of blood volume in the small vessels of the leg, with an initial\
  \ fast phase followed by a more gradual increase at least partly contributing to\
  \ the relocation of fluid during orthostatic stress. \xA9 2012 The Authors. Journal\
