abstract: "Background and Objectives: The influence of interindividual differences\
  \ on brain activation during obstacle negotiation and the implications for walking\
  \ performance are poorly understood in older adults. This study investigated the\
  \ extent to which prefrontal recruitment during obstacle negotiation is explained\
  \ by differences in age, executive function, and sex. These data were interpreted\
  \ according to the Compensation-Related Utilization of Neural Circuits Hypothesis\
  \ (CRUNCH) framework of brain aging. We also tested the association between prefrontal\
  \ recruitment and walking performance. Research Design and Methods: Prefrontal oxygenated\
  \ hemoglobin concentration (O 2 Hb) was measured during typical walking (Typical)\
  \ and obstacle negotiation (Obstacles) tasks in 50 adults aged 65 years and older\
  \ using functional near-in-frared spectroscopy. The primary outcome was the change\
  \ in prefrontal recruitment (\u2206PFR), measured as Obstacles \u2206O 2 Hb minus\
  \ Typical \u2206O 2 Hb. Multiple regression was used to test the relationship between\
  \ \u2206PFR and age, executive function measured by the Trail Making Test, and sex.\
  \ Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to investigate the association between\
  \ \u2206PFR and the cost of Obstacles walking speed relative to Typical walking.\
  \ Results: Age, executive function, and their interaction significantly predicted\
  \ greater \u2206PFR (R 2 = 0.34, p = .01). Participants were subgrouped according\
  \ to age and executive function to examine the interaction effects. Adults of lower\
  \ age and with lower executive function exhibited greater \u2206PFR during Obstacles\
  \ compared to their peers with higher executive function (p = .03). Adults of advanced\
  \ age exhibited a ceiling of prefrontal recruitment during obstacle negotiation\
  \ , regardless of executive function level (p = .87). Greater \u2206PFR was significantly\
  \ associated with a smaller cost of Obstacles (r = 0.3, p = .03)."
