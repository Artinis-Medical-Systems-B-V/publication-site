abstract: "Executive function and motor control deficits adversely affect gait performance\
  \ with age, but the neural correlates underlying this interaction during stair climbing\
  \ remains unclear. Twenty older adults (72.7 \xB1 6.9 years) completed single tasks:\
  \ standing and responding to a response time task (SC), ascending or descending\
  \ stairs (SMup, SMdown); and a dual-task: responding while ascending or descending\
  \ stairs (DTup, DTdown). Prefrontal hemodynamic response changes (\u2206HbO2, \u2206\
  HbR) were examined using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), gait speed\
  \ was measured using in-shoe smart insoles, and vocal response time and accuracy\
  \ were recorded. Findings revealed increased \u2206HbO2 (p = 0.020) and slower response\
  \ times (p < 0.001) during dual-versus single tasks. \u2206HbR (p = 0.549), accuracy\
  \ (p = 0.135) and gait speed (p = 0.475) were not significantly different between\
  \ tasks or stair climbing conditions. \u2206HbO2 and response time findings suggest\
  \ that executive processes are less efficient during dual-tasks. These findings,\
  \ in addition to gait speed and accuracy maintenance, may provide insights into\
  \ the neural changes that precede performance declines. To capture the subtle differences\
  \ between stair ascent and descent and extend our understanding of the neural correlates\
  \ of stair climbing in older adults, future studies should examine more difficult\
  \ cognitive tasks."
