abstract: "The poor spatial resolution of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) makes\
  \ it difficult to distinguish two closely located cortical areas from each other.\
  \ Here, a combination of multi-channel NIRS and a centre of gravity (CoG) approach\
  \ (widely accepted in the field of transcranial magnetic stimulation; TMS) was used\
  \ to discriminate between closely located cortical areas activated during hand and\
  \ foot movements. Similarly, the possibility of separating the more anteriorly represented\
  \ discrete movements from rhythmic movements was studied. Thirteen healthy right-handed\
  \ subjects performed rhythmic or discrete ('task') hand or foot ('extremity') tapping.\
  \ Hemodynamic responses were measured using an 8-channel NIRS setup. For oxyhemoglobin\
  \ (OHb) and deoxyhemoglobin (HHb), a CoG was determined for each condition using\
  \ the mean hemodynamic responses and the coordinates of the channels. Significant\
  \ hemodynamic responses were found for hand and foot movements. Based on the HHb\
  \ responses, the NIRS-CoG of hand movements was located 0.6 cm more laterally compared\
  \ to the NIRS-CoG of foot movements. For OHb responses no difference in NIRS-CoG\
  \ was found for 'extremity' nor for 'task'. This is the first NIRS study showing\
  \ hemodynamic responses for isolated foot movements. Furthermore, HHb responses\
  \ have the potential to be used in multi-channel NIRS experiments requiring differential\
  \ activation of motor cortex areas linked to either hand or foot movements. \xA9\
