abstract: "Background: Aerobic adaptations following interval training are supposed\
  \ to be mediated by increased local blood supply. However, knowledge is scarce on\
  \ the detailed relationship between exercise duration and local post-exercise blood\
  \ supply and oxygen availability. This study aimed to examine the effect of five\
  \ different exercise durations, ranging from 30 to 240 s, on post-exercise muscle\
  \ oxygenation and relative changes in hemoglobin concentration. Methods: Healthy\
  \ male subjects (N = 18) performed an experimental protocol of five exercise bouts\
  \ (30, 60, 90,: 120, and 240 s) at 80 % of peak oxygen uptake VO2peak in a randomized\
  \ order, separated by 5-min recovery periods. To examine the influence of aerobic\
  \ fitness, we compared subjects with gas exchange thresholds (GET): above 60 % VO2peak\
  \ (GET60+) with subjects reaching GET below 60 % VO2peak (GET60\u2212). VO2 and\
  \ relative changes in:: concentrations of oxygenated hemoglobin, deoxygenated hemoglobin,\
  \ and total hemoglobin were continuously measured with near-infrared spectroscopy\
  \ of the vastus lateralis muscle. Results: Post-exercise oxygen availability and\
  \ local blood supply increased significantly until the 90-s exercise duration and\
  \ reached a plateau thereafter. Considering aerobic fitness, the GET60+ group reached\
  \ maximum post-exercise oxygen availability earlier (60 s) than the GET60\u2212\
  \ group (90 s). Conclusions: Our results suggest that (1) 90 s has evolved as the\
  \ minimum interval duration to enhance local oxygen availability and blood supply\
  \ following cycling exercise at 80 % VO2peak; whereas (2) 60 s is sufficient to:\
  \ trigger the same effects in subjects with GET60 + ."
