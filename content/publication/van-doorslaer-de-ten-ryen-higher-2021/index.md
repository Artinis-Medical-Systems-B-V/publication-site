abstract: 'Acute hypoxia has previously been suggested to potentiate resistance training-induced
  hypertrophy by activating satellite cell-dependent myogenesis rather than an improvement
  in protein balance in human. Here, we tested this hypothesis after a 4-week hypoxic
  vs normoxic resistance training protocol. For that purpose, 19 physically active
  male subjects were recruited to perform 6 sets of 10 repetitions of a one-leg knee
  extension exercise at 80% 1-RM 3 times/week for 4 weeks in normoxia (FiO2: 0.21;
  n = 9) or in hypoxia (FiO2: 0.135, n = 10). Blood and skeletal muscle samples were
  taken before and after the training period. Muscle fractional protein synthetic
  rate was measured over the whole period by deuterium incorporation into the protein
  pool and muscle thickness by ultrasound. At the end of the training protocol, the
  strength gain was higher in the hypoxic vs the normoxic group despite no changes
  in muscle thickness and in the fractional protein synthetic rate. Only early myogenesis,
  as assessed by higher MyoD and Myf5 mRNA levels, appeared to be enhanced by hypoxia
  compared to normoxia. No effects were found on myosin heavy chain expression, markers
  of oxidative metabolism and lactate transport in the skeletal muscle. Though the
  present study failed to unravel clearly the mechanisms by which hypoxic resistance
  training is particularly potent to increase muscle strength, it is important message
  to keep in mind that this training strategy could be effective for all athletes
  looking at developing and optimizing their maximal muscle strength.'
