abstract: 'Abstract  BACKGROUND AND AIMS Cognitive impairment is highly prevalent
  in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) individuals. Brain oxygenation is a parameter
  that plays major role in cognitive function. This study aimed to examine for the
  first time changes in brain oxygenation during a mental and a mild physical task
  in hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients.   METHOD A total of
  63 ESKD patients (≥18 years old) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Patients
  were allocated in two groups according to dialysis modality (n = 29 HD and n = 34
  PD). All participants underwent a mental (countdown from 100 to 0 by 7, performed
  twice) and a mild physical task (a 3-min intermittent handgrip exercise at 35% of
  maximal handgrip strength). Changes in brain oxygenation [oxy—(O2Hb), deoxy—(HHb)
  and total—(tHb) hemoglobin] during the two tasks were continuously recorded via
  near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS, Artinis).   RESULTS Age, sex and dialysis vintage
  did not differ between the two groups. The average response in brain oxygenation
  during the mental task (O2Hb change from rest: 1.51 ± 1.68 versus 1.60 ± 1.82 μmol,
  in HD and PD, respectively, P = 0.841), as well as the duration needed for task
  completion (191.53 ± 124.27 versus 200.19 ± 118.84 s, P = 0.781) were similar between
  groups. Furthermore, the average response in brain oxygenation during the handgrip
  exercise also did not differ between the groups (O2Hb change 1.20 ± 1.03 versus
  1.49 ± 0.95 μmol, respectively, P = 0.262). In the total cohort, the average response
  in brain oxygenation during handgrip exercise was inversely correlated with dialysis
  vintage (P &lt; 0.05).   CONCLUSION Dialysis modality does not appear to have an
  impact on brain oxygenation, as HD and PD patients presented similar responses during
  a mental and a mild physical task. Dialysis vintage may negatively affect brain
  oxygenation in ESKD individuals.'
