abstract: We hypothesized that skeletal muscle oxygenation, measured by Near-infrared
  spectroscopy (mNIRS), is associated with cardiac workload during incremental exercise.
  Healthy subjects (n = 30, age 27 ± 6, 15 females) performed a maximal exercise test
  starting from 0 W, following an incremental protocol starting from 40 W and increasing
  load every 2 min until exhaustion. Systolic blood pressure and breath-by-breath
  gas exchanges were measured to analyze oxygen uptake and respiratory compensatory
  point (RCP). Tissue saturation index (TSI) by mNIRS was measured from vastus lateralis.
  The slopes of TSI and rate pressure product (RPP) were calculated using the values
  from 0 W to 100% of the RCP threshold. RPP was 31,734 ± 3909 mmHg·bpm, and TSI was
  50.0% ± 8.4% at the intensity of RCP. RPP and TSI slopes were 3463 ± 541 and −2.75 ± 1.68,
  respectively. In linear regression analysis, RPP slope was used as a dependent variable,
  and sex, body fat %, maximal oxygen uptake, hemoglobin, baseline SBP, and TSI% slope
  were used as predictor variables; TSI slope was the only variable associated with
  RPP slope (r = 0.60, p = 0.001). Cardiac workload during submaximal exercise, documented
  by RPP slope calculated over equal metabolic exercise intensities for all subjects,
  is partly regulated by skeletal muscle oxygenation, potentially due to the differences
  in microcirculation and/or mitochondrial properties in healthy young subjects.
