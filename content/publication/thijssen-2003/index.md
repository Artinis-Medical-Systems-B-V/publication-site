abstract: 'Background: Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) is a major problem in nowadays
  health care and creates high financial costs and personal distress. Average prevalence
  rates in the Netherlands vary from 20-40% of the working population. Insight into
  the patho-physiological mechanism of RSI is important in order to establish adequate
  treatment and prevention programs. Objective: The aim of this study was to gain
  insight in muscle oxygen consumption (mVO(2)), blood flow (BF), and reoxygenation
  (ReOx) in the forearm of computer workers with stage III Repetitive Strain Injury
  (RSI). Method: We have used continuous wave infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to measure
  these variables. Measurements were conducted on the extensor and flexor muscle in
  both arms as well in RSI-patients (n=10) as in control subjects (n=21). A protocol
  of increased isometric repetitive contraction in a handgrip ergonometer was used
  with increasing levels of strength. Results: mVO(2) in the extensor muscle in RSI-subjects
  (dominant side) was increased compared to control subjects and compared to the non-dominant
  side (p<0.05). ReOx was not increased in RSI (dominant side-extensor muscle). However,
  there was a tendency towards statistical significance (p=0.065). BF in rest was
  equal in both groups, however after exercise it tended to be increased. Half-time
  recovery (T-1/2) was measured during only one part of the protocol and it was significantly
  increased (p<0.05). Conclusion: mVO(2) in RSI is impaired. BF and ReOx did not show
  difference between both groups. Future research should aim at a microvascular dysfunction
  in RSI.'
