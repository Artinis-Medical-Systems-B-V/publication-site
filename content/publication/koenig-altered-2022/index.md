abstract: 'Abstract Impairments in both stress regulation and emotion recognition
  have been associated with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and non-suicidal
  self-injury (NSSI). Although it has been proposed that emotion recognition deficits
  particularly emerge during stress, this hypothesis has not been fully investigated.
  Adolescents with and without NSSI performed emotion recognition tasks before and
  after the employment of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). The psychobiological
  stress response was captured with psychological self-reports (affect, stress and
  dissociation), physiological recordings (heart rate, HR, and heart rate variability,
  HRV) and endocrinological sampling of saliva (cortisol and alpha-amylase). Mixed-linear
  models were applied to analyze stress-induced changes in emotion recognition performance
  and respective stress response measures. The TSST elicited altered psychobiological
  stress responses in adolescents with NSSI: A more pronounced decrease in positive
  affect, a more pronounced increase in negative affect, a less pronounced increase
  in HR, a less pronounced decrease in HRV and a more pronounced increase in alpha-amylase
  throughout the stress induction than adolescents without NSSI. Stress responses
  (dissociation, negative affect, cortisol and HR) differed as a function of BPD severity
  on a continuum, illustrating greater reactivity on self-reports but decreased biological
  responsiveness in those with greater BPD severity. Stress induction had similar
  effects on emotion recognition in adolescents with and without NSSI. Recognition
  sensitivity and recognition speed equally increased, in the absence of any differences
  in recognition accuracy. In contrast to prominent propositions, psychosocial stress
  does not appear to account for impaired emotion recognition across the BPD spectrum.'
