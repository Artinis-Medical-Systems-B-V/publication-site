abstract: Past research has demonstrated the validity of co-evolutionary model in
  depicting human design activities, while few empirical studies have articulated
  the connections between design behavior and implicit cognitive process during team-level
  design co-evolution. This paper proposes a novel method that incorporate a neurobiological
  indicator, inter-brain synchrony (IBS), to measure brain behaviors and neural connectivity
  among interacting collaborators. We documented participants’ verbal and behavioral
  data via video recordings, as well as simultaneously captured their neural responses
  utilizing functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) while they were engaged
  in a conceptual design task. These codlings were adopted to segment the recorded
  protocol data into smaller episodes, serving as the basis for the subsequent fNIRS
  data analysis. Preliminary findings revealed the effects of exploring dimensions
  (problem and solution) and communication approaches on neural synchrony among collaborators.
