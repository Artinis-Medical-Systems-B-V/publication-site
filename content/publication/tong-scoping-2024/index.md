abstract: Late-life depression is one of the most damaging mental illnesses, disrupting
  the normal lives of older people by causing chronic illness and cognitive impairment.
  Patients with late-life depression, accompanied by changes in appetite, insomnia,
  fatigue and guilt, are more likely to experience irritability, anxiety and somatic
  symptoms. It increases the risk of suicide and dementia and is a major challenge
  for the public health systems. The current clinical assessment, identification and
  effectiveness assessment of late-life depression are primarily based on history
  taking, mental status examination and scale scoring, which lack subjectivity and
  precision. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy is a rapidly developing optical
  imaging technology that objectively reflects the oxygenation of hemoglobin in different
  cerebral regions during different tasks and assesses the functional status of the
  cerebral cortex. This article presents a comprehensive review of the assessment
  of functional near-infrared spectroscopy technology in assessing depressive symptoms,
  social functioning, and cognitive functioning in patients with late-life depression.
  The use of functional near-infrared spectroscopy provides greater insight into the
  neurobiological mechanisms underlying depression and helps to assess these three
  aspects of functionality in depressed patients. In addition, the study discusses
  the limitations of previous research and explores potential advances in the field.
