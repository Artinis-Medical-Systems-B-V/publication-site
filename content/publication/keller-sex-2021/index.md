abstract: 'Abstract It remains to be fully elucidated if there are sex-specific physiological
  adjustments within the human neuromuscular and vascular systems that contribute
  to symptoms of fatigue during a sustained bilateral task. This, in part, is likely
  due to various limitations in experimental design such as an inability to independently
  record force fluctuations from each limb. Objective: Therefore, the purpose of the
  current study was to examine the fatigue-induced changes in muscle excitation, force
  fluctuations, skeletal muscle tissue saturation (StO2), and muscle blood flow resulting
  from a sustained, bilateral task. Approach: Thirty healthy, college-aged adults
  (15 males, 15 females) performed a bilateral leg task at 25% of maximum voluntary
  isometric (MVIC). Before and after the task, MVICs were completed. Resting and post-task
  femoral artery blood flow (FABF) were determined. Muscle excitation was quantified
  as electromyographic amplitude (EMG AMP) from the right and left vastus lateralis.
  During the task, force fluctuations were determined independently from each leg.
  The StO2 signal was collected with a near-infrared spectroscopy device attached
  to the right vastus lateralis. The rate of change in these variables was calculated
  via simple linear regression. The exercise-induced magnitude of change in MVIC (i.e.,
  performance fatigability) and FABF (i.e., active hyperemia) was determined. Main
  results: There was no sex difference in the percent decline in MVIC (20.5±20.1%
  vs. 16.4± 3.5%; ptextgreater0.05). There were no inter-leg differences in EMG AMP
  or force fluctuations. The males exhibited a faster rate of increase in EMG AMP
  (b=0.13 vs. b=0.08; ptextless0.001), whereas the females exhibited a slower rate
  of decline in StO2 (b=-0.049 vs. b=-0.080). There was no sex difference in force
  fluctuations or change in FABF. Significance: Males and females likely have different
  neuromuscular strategies and muscle characteristics, but these did not elicit a
  sex difference in performance fatigability.'
