abstract: 'Background: A shift towards the dynamic measurement of physiologic resilience
  and improved technology incorporated into experimental paradigms in aging research
  is producing high-resolution data. Identifying the most appropriate analysis method
  for this type of data is a challenge. In this work, the functional principal component
  analysis (fPCA) was employed to demonstrate a data-driven approach to the analysis
  of high-resolution data in aging research.  Methods: Cerebral oxygenation during
  standing was measured in a large cohort [The Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging (TILDA)].
  FPCA was performed on tissue saturation index (TSI) data. A regression analysis
  was then conducted with the functional principal component (fPC) scores as the explanatory
  variables and transition time as the response.  Results: The mean ± SD age of the
  analysis sample was 64 ± 8 years. Females made up 54% of the sample and overall,
  43% had tertiary education. The first PC explained 96% of the variance in cerebral
  oxygenation upon standing and was related to a baseline shift. Subsequent components
  described the recovery to before-stand levels (fPC2), drop magnitude and initial
  recovery (fPC3 and fPC4) as well as a temporal shift in the location of the minimum
  TSI value (fPC5). Transition time was associated with components describing the
  magnitude and timing of the nadir.  Conclusions: Application of fPCA showed utility
  in reducing a large amount of data to a small number of parameters which summarize
  the inter-participant variation in TSI upon standing. A demonstration of principal
  component regression was provided to allow for continued use and development of
  data-driven approaches to high-resolution data analysis in aging research.'
