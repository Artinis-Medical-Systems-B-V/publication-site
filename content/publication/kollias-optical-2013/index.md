abstract: "Background: Painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis (PBS/IC) is\
  \ defined as a syndrome of urgency, frequency, and suprapubic pain in the absence\
  \ of positive urine culture or obvious bladder pathology. As no specific etiology\
  \ has been identified yet, no specific methodology exists for diagnosis of this\
  \ condition. One potential etiology of PBS/IC is inflammation of the bladder mucosa\
  \ associated with abnormal angiogenesis and ulcerative lesions. The purpose of this\
  \ study was to examine the feasibility of using transcutaneous near infrared spectroscopy\
  \ (NIRS) of the bladder to monitor tissue oxygenation and hemodynamics as a means\
  \ of differentiating subjects diagnosed with PBS/IC from those with other bladder\
  \ conditions. Methods: Twenty-four adult patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction\
  \ were divided into 2 groups, PBS/IC and non-PBS/IC after standard diagnostic investigations.\
  \ Detrusor oxygen saturation percentage (TSI%) was measured in all subjects while\
  \ they were at rest in a supine position, using a spatially resolved (SR) NIRS instrument.\
  \ Mean values of detrusor TSI% were significantly different between the two groups\
  \ (74.2%\xB14.9 in PBS/IC vs. 63.6%\xB15.5 in non-PBS/IC, P<0.0005). Results: Noninvasive\
  \ NIRS interrogation of the bladder demonstrated that patients diagnosed as having\
  \ PBS/IC had significantly higher detrusor oxygen saturation at rest. Conclusions:\
  \ SR-NIRS as a feasible non-noninvasive entity for use in the evaluation of patients\
  \ for the presence or absence of physiologic changes associated with PBS/IC. \xA9\
