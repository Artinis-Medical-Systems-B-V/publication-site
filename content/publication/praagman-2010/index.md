abstract: "To study elbow muscle load sharing we investigated the effect of external\
  \ flexion-extension (FE) and pronation-supination (PS) moments and elbow angle on\
  \ muscle activation and oxygen consumption (V\u0307O2).Two data sets were obtained.\
  \ First, (n=6) electromyography (EMG) of elbow flexors (long and short heads of\
  \ biceps brachii, brachioradialis, brachialis) and extensors (long and short heads\
  \ of triceps brachii and anconeus) was recorded in all combinations of FE and PS\
  \ moments at three force levels and four elbow angles (50\xB0, 70\xB0, 90\xB0 and\
  \ 110\xB0). Second, (n=4) EMG and V\u0307O2 of three muscles (both heads of biceps\
  \ and lateral head of triceps) were measured simultaneously during a subset of the\
  \ above conditions.Joint angle and therefore both moment arm and muscle length influenced\
  \ both EMG amplitude and the load sharing between muscles. The principles behind\
  \ load sharing, however, were difficult to quantify, since it was impossible to\
  \ distinguish between all individual aspects that affect muscle activity. We found\
  \ a linear relationship between EMG and V\u0307O2, while joint angle had no major\
  \ effect. Although in general subjects showed comparable muscle activation patterns,\
  \ there were also considerable inter-individual differences, which might be explained\
  \ by the use of different optimisation strategies or differences in morphology.\
