abstract: Abstract  Living in high expressed emotion (EE) environments tends to increase
  the relapse rate in schizophrenia (SZ). At present, the neural substrates responsible
  for high EE in SZ remain poorly understood. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy
  (fNIRS) may be of great use to quantitatively assess cortical hemodynamics and elucidate
  the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. In this study, we designed novel low-
  (positivity and warmth) and high-EE (criticism, negative emotion, and hostility)
  stimulations, in the form of audio, to investigate cortical hemodynamics. We used
  fNIRS to measure hemodynamic signals while participants listened to the recorded
  audio. Healthy controls (HCs,   $$n=42$$   n = 42     ) showed increased hemodynamic
  activation in the major language centers across EE stimulations, with stronger activation
  in Wernickeâ€™s area during the processing of negative emotional language. Compared
  to HCs, people with SZ (   $$n=41$$   n = 41     ) exhibited smaller hemodynamic
  activation in the major language centers across EE stimulations. In addition, people
  with SZ showed weaker or insignificant hemodynamic deactivation in the medial prefrontal
  cortex. Notably, hemodynamic activation in SZ was found to be negatively correlated
  with the negative syndrome scale score at high EE. Our findings suggest that the
  neural mechanisms in SZ are altered and disrupted, especially during negative emotional
  language processing. This supports the feasibility of using the designed EE stimulations
  to assess people who are vulnerable to high-EE environments, such as SZ. Furthermore,
  our findings provide preliminary evidence for future research on functional neuroimaging
  biomarkers for people with psychiatric disorders.
