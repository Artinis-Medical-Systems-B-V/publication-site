abstract: "This study aims to assess the vigilance task-related change in connectivity\
  \ in healthy adults using wavelet phase coherence (WPCO) analysis of near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy signals (NIRS). NIRS is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique for\
  \ assessing brain activity. Continuous recordings of the NIRS signals were obtained\
  \ from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and sensorimotor cortical areas of 20 young healthy\
  \ adults (24.9 \xB1 3.3 years) during a 10-min resting state and a 20-min vigilance\
  \ task state. The vigilance task was used to simulate driving mental load by judging\
  \ three random numbers (i.e., whether odd numbers). The task was divided into two\
  \ sessions: the first 10 min (Task t1) and the second 10 min (Task t2). The WPCO\
  \ of six channel pairs were calculated in five frequency intervals: 0.6-2 Hz (I),\
  \ 0.145-0.6 Hz (II), 0.052-0.145 Hz (III), 0.021-0.052 Hz (IV), and 0.0095-0.021\
  \ Hz (V). The significant WPCO formed global connectivity (GC) maps in intervals\
  \ I and II and functional connectivity (FC) maps in intervals III to V. Results\
  \ show that the GC levels in interval I and FC levels in interval III were significantly\
  \ lower in the Task t2 than in the resting state (p < 0.05), particularly between\
  \ the left PFC and bilateral sensorimotor regions. Also, the reaction time (RT)\
  \ shows an increase in Task t2 compared with that in Task t1. However, no significant\
  \ difference in WPCO was found between Task t1 and resting state. The results showed\
  \ that the change in FC at the range of 0.6-2 Hz was not attributed to the vigilance\
  \ task per se, but the interaction effect of vigilance task and time factors. The\
  \ findings suggest that the decreased attention level might be partly attributed\
  \ to the reduced GC levels between the left prefrontal region and sensorimotor area.\
  \ The present results provide a new insight into the vigilance task-related brain\
  \ activity."
