abstract: 'Background Insufficient cardiac output (Q) in individuals with heart failure
  (HF) limits daily functioning and reduces quality of life. While lower cerebral
  perfusion, secondary to limitations in Q, has been observed during moderate-intensity
  efforts, individuals with HF may also be at risk for lower perfusion during even
  low-intensity ambulatory activities. Methods We determined whether HF is associated
  with an altered cerebrovascular response to low-intensity activities representative
  of typical challenges of daily living. In this study, we monitored central hemodynamics
  and middle cerebral blood velocity (MCAv) and cerebral tissue oxygenation (near-infrared
  spectroscopy) in 10 individuals with HF (78±4 years; left ventricular ejection fraction
  (LVEF) 20-61%) and 13 similar aged controls (79±8 years; LVEF 52-73%) during three
  randomized transitions: 1) supine-to-standing; 2) sitting-to-slow-paced over-ground
  walking; and 3) sitting-to-normal-paced over-ground walking. Results Throughout
  supine, sitting, standing, and both walking conditions, individuals with HF had
  lower cardiac index (Qi) and cerebral tissue oxygenation than controls (Ptextless0.05),
  and MCAv was lower across the range of blood pressure in HF (P=0.051) and during
  walking only (P=0.011). Individuals with HF had an attenuated increase in stroke
  volume index and Qi during normal-paced walking compared to controls (Ptextless0.01).
  Conclusion The indices of cerebral perfusion from MCAv and cerebral oxygenation
  were lower during ambulatory activities in individuals with HF; however, relationships
  between MCAv and blood pressure were not different between HF and controls indicating
  no difference in static cerebral autoregulation.'
