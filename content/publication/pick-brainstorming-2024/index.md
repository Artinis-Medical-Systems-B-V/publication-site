abstract: Although the impact of group dynamics on creativity is widely recognized,
  prior research has primarily concentrated on individuals in isolation from social
  context. To address this lacuna, we focus on groups as the fundamental unit of analysis.
  We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to examine brain activity
  in groups of four during brainstorming discussions. We assessed interbrain coupling
  in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a brain region linked to flexibility,
  and in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), a region associated with imitation. Our
  findings demonstrate that creativity focused discussions induced interbrain coupling
  both in regions related to flexibility and herding. Notably, interbrain coupling
  in the IFG was associated with more imitation of responses. Critically, while interbrain
  coupling in the DLPFC positively predicted group creativity, in the IFG it negatively
  predicted creativity. These findings suggest that increase in group mindsets of
  flexibility relative to herding is important for enhancing group creativity.
