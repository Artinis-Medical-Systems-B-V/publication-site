abstract: "When interacting with technical systems, users experience mental workload.\
  \ Particularly in multitasking scenarios (e.g., interacting with the car navigation\
  \ system while driving) it is desired to not distract the users from their primary\
  \ task. For such purposes, human-machine interfaces (HCIs) are desirable which continuously\
  \ monitor the users' workload and dynamically adapt the behavior of the interface\
  \ to the measured workload. While memory tasks have been shown to elicit hemodynamic\
  \ responses in the brain when averaging over multiple trials, a robust single trial\
  \ classification is a crucial prerequisite for the purpose of dynamically adapting\
  \ HCIs to the workload of its user. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays an important\
  \ role in the processing of memory and the associated workload. In this study of\
  \ 10 subjects, we used functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), a non-invasive\
  \ imaging modality, to sample workload activity in the PFC. The results show up\
  \ to 78% accuracy for single-trial discrimination of three levels of workload from\
  \ each other. We use an n-back task (n \u2208 1, 2, 3) to induce different levels\
  \ of workload, forcing subjects to continuously remember the last one, two, or three\
  \ of rapidly changing items. Our experimental results show that measuring hemodynamic\
  \ responses in the PFC with fNIRS, can be used to robustly quantify and classify\
  \ mental workload. Single trial analysis is still a young field that suffers from\
  \ a general lack of standards. To increase comparability of fNIRS methods and results,\
  \ the data corpus for this study is made available online. \xA9 2014 Herff, Heger,\
