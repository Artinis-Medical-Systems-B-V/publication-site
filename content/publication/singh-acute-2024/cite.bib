 abstract = {Assessment of cerebral oxygenation during repeated squat stands following an acute sport-related concussion (SRC) has the potential to identify physiological changes following SRC. All varsity university athletes completed a pre-season assessment and 53 were followed up within 5-days of suffering an SRC. Of the 53 participants, 29 had continuous beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP; sampled at 200 hz) collected by finger photoplethysmography, and 53 had right prefrontal cortex oxygenation collected by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS; sampled at 10 hz). Participants completed a 5-min repeated squat (10 s) stand (10 s) manoeuvre (0.05 hz). Wavelet transformation was applied to the signals, separating them into smooth muscle cell (0.05 to 0.145 hz), respiratory (0.145 to 0.6 hz) and cardiac (0.6 to 2 hz) frequency intervals, with the 5-min squat stand manoeuvre compared from pre-season to post-concussion. A significant amplitude increase (p \textless 0.05) in oxyhaemoglobin, total haemoglobin and haemoglobin difference following SRC was found at the cardiac interval. During the squat stand dynamic cerebral autoregulation challenge, this exploratory study found an elevated contribution from the heart to the oxygenation response at the right prefrontal cortex, suggestive of a cardiac compensatory response during concussion. Future research with cerebral blood flow alongside NIRS can provide greater insight to dynamic cerebral autoregulation.},
