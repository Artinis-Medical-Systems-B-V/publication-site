abstract: Assessment of cerebral oxygenation during repeated squat stands following
  an acute sport-related concussion (SRC) has the potential to identify physiological
  changes following SRC. All varsity university athletes completed a pre-season assessment
  and 53 were followed up within 5-days of suffering an SRC. Of the 53 participants,
  29 had continuous beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP; sampled at 200 hz) collected
  by finger photoplethysmography, and 53 had right prefrontal cortex oxygenation collected
  by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS; sampled at 10 hz). Participants completed a
  5-min repeated squat (10 s) stand (10 s) manoeuvre (0.05 hz). Wavelet transformation
  was applied to the signals, separating them into smooth muscle cell (0.05 to 0.145 hz),
  respiratory (0.145 to 0.6 hz) and cardiac (0.6 to 2 hz) frequency intervals, with
  the 5-min squat stand manoeuvre compared from pre-season to post-concussion. A significant
  amplitude increase (p textless 0.05) in oxyhaemoglobin, total haemoglobin and haemoglobin
  difference following SRC was found at the cardiac interval. During the squat stand
  dynamic cerebral autoregulation challenge, this exploratory study found an elevated
  contribution from the heart to the oxygenation response at the right prefrontal
  cortex, suggestive of a cardiac compensatory response during concussion. Future
  research with cerebral blood flow alongside NIRS can provide greater insight to
  dynamic cerebral autoregulation.
