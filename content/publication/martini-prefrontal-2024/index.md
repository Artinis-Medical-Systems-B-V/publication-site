abstract: 'Background: Concussions result in transient symptoms stemming from a cortical
  metabolic energy crisis. Though this metabolic energy crisis typically resolves
  in a month, symptoms can persist for years. The symptomatic period is associated
  with gait dysfunction, the cortical underpinnings of which are poorly understood.
  Quantifying prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity during gait may provide insight into
  post-concussion gait dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects
  of persisting concussion symptoms on PFC activity during gait. We hypothesized that
  adults with persisting concussion symptoms would have greater PFC activity during
  gait than controls. Within the concussed group, we hypothesized that worse symptoms
  would relate to increased PFC activity during gait, and that increased PFC activity
  would relate to worse gait characteristics. Methods: The Neurobehavior Symptom Inventory
  (NSI) characterized concussion symptoms. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy quantified
  PFC activity (relative concentration changes of oxygenated hemoglobin [HbO2]) in
  14 people with a concussion and 25 controls. Gait was assessed using six inertial
  sensors in the concussion group. Results: Average NSI total score was 26.4 (13.2).
  HbO2 was significantly higher ( P = .007) for the concussed group (0.058 [0.108])
  compared to the control group (−0.016 [0.057]). Within the concussion group, HbO2
  correlated with NSI total symptom score (ρ = .62; P = .02), sagittal range of motion
  ( r = .79; P = .001), and stride time variability ( r = −.54; P = .046). Conclusion:
  These data suggest PFC activity relates to symptom severity and some gait characteristics
  in people with persistent concussion symptoms. Identifying the neurophysiological
  underpinnings to gait deficits post-concussion expands our knowledge of motor behavior
  deficits in people with persistent concussion symptoms.'
