abstract: Functional near-infrared imaging is a brain imaging technology that measures
  changes in cerebral blood oxygenation. Due to its high portability and spatial resolution,
  fNIRS is widely employed in emotion cognition. However, current feature extraction
  methods for fNIRS predominantly rely on statistical feature engineering, often lacking
  deeper exploration and analysis of both long-term and short-term characteristics
  of fNIRS signals. In response to this limitation, this paper presents research conducted
  on the fNIRS emotion dataset NEMO and introduces an emotion recognition method based
  on multi-scale fusion features. By integrating vector features and time-delay embedding
  features, the proposed method facilitates the identification of dimensional emotions.
  The model demonstrates its efficacy by effectively distinguishing emotions in binary
  classifications of valence and arousal, as well as in the four-class classification
  of dimensional emotions. These results confirm the utility of fNIRS in emotion decoding
  and emotional state assessment, offering valuable blood oxygen signal features for
  emotion recognition. Furthermore, this work provides a viable approach for decoding
  the neural activities associated with dimensional emotions, and introduces a new
  perspective for advancing our understanding of brain processes related to emotion.
