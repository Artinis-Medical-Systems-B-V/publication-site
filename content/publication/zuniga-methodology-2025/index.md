abstract: 'Heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) are established measures
  related to cardiovascular disease (CVD), a known risk factor correlated with lower
  urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and overactive bladder (OAB). However, no standardized
  methodology exists to relate HR and HRV changes to uroflowmetry, the gold-standard
  evaluation for LUTS. Objective: to test the feasibility of methodology for synchronous,
  noninvasive measurement of HR and HRV, detrusor activity and uroflowmetry. Equipment:
  wireless continuous wave near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) instruments Poralite/Portamon
  (Artinis Medical Systems) with 3 wavelengths (785, 808, 830nm), spatially resolved
  configuration, and raw optical data collection at 25 to 100Hz. Protocol: Study subjects
  with and without LUTS provided data on voiding symptoms (validated International
  Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire). Blood pressure and body mass index
  measurements allowed calculation of WHO cardiovascular disease risk. Subjects then
  wore the Portalite over the frontal cortex (HR and HRV monitoring) and the Portamon
  suprapubically (detrusor oxygenation monitoring). Device recording was linked synchronously
  to a wireless uroflow scale. Subjects were monitored for a 1-minute pre-void baseline,
  during voiding, and a 1-minute post-void baseline. Bladder scans confirmed bladder
  volume textgreater150cc pre-baseline and measured post-void residual volume. N=40
  (17 controls, 23 cases) completed the protocol. NIRS accurately monitored HR, HRV,
  detrusor oxygenation, and uroflowmetry in all cases. Synchronous, wireless monitoring
  to record the relationship between HR, HRV, detrusor activity, and uroflowmetry
  using non-invasive NIRS is feasible and generates reproducible results. This method
  will allow for larger scale studies analyzing the pathophysiology of CVD related
  to LUTS and OAB.'
