abstract: 'This study aimed to associate body composition with fractional oxygen extraction
  at rest in healthy adult men. Fourteen healthy adults (26.93 ± 2.49 years) from
  Chile participated. Body composition was assessed with octopole bioimpedance, and
  resting muscle oxygenation was evaluated in the vastus lateralis quadriceps with
  near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during a vascular occlusion test, analyzing the
  muscleVO2, resaturation velocity during reactive hyperemia via the muscle saturation
  index (%TSI), and the area above the curve of HHb (AACrep). It was observed that
  the total and segmented fat mass are associated with lower reoxygenation velocities
  during hyperemia (p = 0.008; β = 0.678: p = 0.002; β = 0.751), and that the total
  and segmented skeletal muscle mass are associated with higher reoxygenation velocities
  during hyperemia (p = 0.020; β = −0.614: p = 0.027; β = −0.587). It was also observed
  that the total and segmented fat mass were associated with a higher area above the
  curve of HHb (AACrep) during hyperemia (p = 0.007; β = 0.692: p = 0.037; β = 0.564),
  and that total and segmented skeletal muscle mass was associated with a lower area
  above the curve of HHb (AACrep) during hyperemia (p = 0.007; β = −0.703: p = 0.017;
  β = −0.632). We concluded that fat mass is associated with lower resaturation rates
  and lower resting fractional O2 extraction levels. In contrast, skeletal muscle
  mass is associated with higher resaturation rates and fractional O2 extraction during
  reactive hyperemia. The AACrep may be relevant in the evaluation of vascular adaptations
  to exercise and metabolic health.'
