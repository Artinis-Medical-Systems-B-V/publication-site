abstract: Following an acute infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
  2 (SARS-CoV-2), a substantial percentage of patients report the persistence of debilitating
  symptoms, often grouped in a syndrome termed ‘long COVID’. We sought to identify
  potential pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the persistence, in some
  long COVID patients, of symptoms related to fatigue/exercise intolerance (excessive
  or early fatigue, excessive or early dyspnoea, muscle weakness, and myalgias) more
  than 2 years after the original infection. Twelve patients who reported persistent
  symptoms (Long COVID group; 57 ± 6 years, mean ± SD), and 14 patients without the
  symptoms (Control group; 57 ± 8 years) were evaluated. An extensive series of measurements
  were performed to identify pathophysiological mechanisms potentially responsible
  for the symptoms. In long COVID patients, all items evaluating quality of life (SF-36
  questionnaire) had lower scores (P textless 0.01) compared to control. The habitual
  level of physical activity, muscle size and strength, maximal aerobic power and
  the ventilatory thresholds, peak cardiac function, the mechanical efficiency of
  cycling, pulmonary  kinetics, microvascular/endothelial function (hyperemic response
  in the common femoral artery during passive leg movements), skeletal muscle oxidative
  metabolism (peak fractional O2 extraction and muscle  recovery kinetics by the repeated
  occlusions test, by near-infrared spectroscopy) were not different in the two groups.
  Evidence of ventilatory inefficiency was described in a subgroup of long COVID patients.
  More than 2 years after the original SARS-CoV-2 infection, a discrepancy was observed
  between the persistence of debilitating symptoms of fatigue/exercise intolerance
  and the absence of several investigated pathophysiological mechanisms. The discrepancy
  may be due to factors that remain to be elucidated.
