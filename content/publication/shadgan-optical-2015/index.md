abstract: Conventionally, diagnosis of lower urinary tract infection (LUTI) is made
  on the basis of history, urine microscopy and culture. But there are limitations
  to this methodology especially in children and special populations where there is
  difficulty in obtaining a full history and details of clinical symptoms. The aim
  of this study was to determine if monitoring bladder wall oxygenation as a measure
  of bladder mucosal inflammation using transcutaneous near-infrared spectroscopy
  (NIRS) allows detection of the presence or absence of LUTI in children. Materials
  and methods A convenience sample of children referred to a pediatric urology clinic
  with an acute LUTI and a control group were studied. Diagnosis was confirmed by
  history, physical examination, laboratory investigations, and urine culture. Participants
  had transcutaneous measurement of an absolute measure of tissue oxygen saturation
  (TSI%) in their bladder wall, and a quadriceps muscle control site, using a spatially
  resolved (SR) wireless NIRS device. Average measures of bladder wall TSI% (B.TSI%)
  and quadriceps TSI% (Q.TSI%) and their differences (TSI.diff) were calculated and
  compared between those with LUTI and controls by performing a two-way repeated analysis
  of variance. Results Thirty-four patients met the inclusion criteria (LUTI n = 12
  and controls n = 22). Comparing LUTI to controls B.TSI% and TSI.diff values were
  significantly higher in the LUTI group (p < 0.0001), while Q.TSI% values were not
  significantly different. Conclusions Optical monitoring of bladder wall oxygenation
  is feasible in children. In this study a significant difference was evident in a
  SR NIRS-derived measure of absolute oxygen saturation in the bladder wall between
  children with UTI diagnosed by conventional testing methods, and those in a control
  group without infection. SR-NIRS monitoring of bladder wall oxygenation may offer
  a rapid and non-invasive means of bedside screening for LUTI where history and/or
  clinical signs are not available or adequate.
