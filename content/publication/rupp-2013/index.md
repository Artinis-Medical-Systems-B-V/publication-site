abstract: "This study aimed to compare changes in skeletal muscle, prefrontal (PFC),\
  \ and motor (MC) cortex hemodynamics during prolonged (i.e., 4-h) fatiguing whole-body\
  \ exercise using multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Ten subjects completed\
  \ three successive 80-min cycling bouts at 45 % of their maximal power output. After\
  \ the 4-h cycling, maximal voluntary contraction force of the leg was decreased\
  \ by $\u223C$25 %. Muscle exhibited reproductive deoxygenation patterns during each\
  \ of the three bouts, whereas intra-bout cerebral hemodynamics were different throughout\
  \ the protocol. Results demonstrate that specific responses to fatiguing exercise\
  \ are found between tissues but also between cortical sites involved in cycling,\
  \ as shown by concomitant PFC hyperoxygenation and MC deoxygenation in the first\
  \ 80 min of exercise. Further insights are needed to understand the consequences\
  \ of these changes regarding the integrative control of motor output while fatigue\
  \ develops over several hours. \xA9 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York."
