abstract: Maintaining balance while simultaneously performing other tasks is common
  during everyday activities. However, this dual-tasking (DT) divides attention and
  increases cognitive demand, which can be detrimental to stability in older adults.
  It is unknown if the focus of attention influences how a dual-task affects balance
  and whether this is detectable in middle-aged adults. This study investigates the
  effect of dual-task and attentional focus on prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity in
  young (YA) and middle-aged (MA) adults using functional-near infrared spectroscopy.
  Blood oxygen level of the PFC was measured during a quiet standing cognitive-motor
  dual-task where MA (n = 15, mean age 57.2 ± 4.8 years, 5 female) and YA (n = 20,
  mean age 24.9 ± 4.7 years, 9 female) stood on a forceplate while either fixating
  their gaze on a target (‘fixed’) or viewing their real-time postural oscillations
  in the anteroposterior direction (‘sway’) with and without serial 7 subtractions.
  It was expected that the MA group would show higher PFC activity, larger COP excursions,
  and poorer performance during DT than the YA group. PFC activity was larger during
  DT and during the fixed condition but did not differ between groups. COP excursion
  was also greater when attention was ‘fixed’ and was consistently larger in MA. MA
  drove a positive correlation between PFC activity and COP excursion during DT indicative
  of a higher attentional demand during distraction. Taken together, this study suggests
  that PFC processing and posture control are different in middle aged adults compared
  to young adults.
