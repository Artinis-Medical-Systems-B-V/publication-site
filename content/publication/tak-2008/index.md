abstract: "Near infared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive method to measure the\
  \ brain activity as the changes of hemoglobin oxygenation through the intact skull.\
  \ In this paper, we statistically analyze the NIRS data based on general linear\
  \ model (GLM) and propose a new theory for making inference using Sun's tube formula.\
  \ More speci cally, we calculate the p-values as the excursion probability of an\
  \ inhomogeneous Gaussian random eld on a two dimensional representation manifold\
  \ that are dependent on the structure of error covariance matrix and the interpolating\
  \ kernels. These powerful tools for excursion probability allows us the super-resolution\
  \ localization of the brain activation which is not possible using the conventional\
  \ NIRS analysis. \xA92008 IEEE."
