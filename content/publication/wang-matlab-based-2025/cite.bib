 abstract = {Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is increasingly used in cognitive neuroscience and clinical research, yet preprocessing raw time-series data remains challenging. We introduce a lightweight MATLAB tool to automate the conversion of fNIRS data into Homer3-compatible “*.nirs” format. Our solution targets non-SNIRF raw data and offers a standardized, user-friendly method to streamline fNIRS data preparation. This Technical Note describes the tool's design, workflow, and potential improvements for future development.},
