abstract: Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is increasingly used in cognitive
  neuroscience and clinical research, yet preprocessing raw time-series data remains
  challenging. We introduce a lightweight MATLAB tool to automate the conversion of
  fNIRS data into Homer3-compatible “*.nirs” format. Our solution targets non-SNIRF
  raw data and offers a standardized, user-friendly method to streamline fNIRS data
  preparation. This Technical Note describes the tool's design, workflow, and potential
  improvements for future development.
