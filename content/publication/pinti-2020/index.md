abstract: The past few decades have seen a rapid increase in the use of functional
  near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in cognitive neuroscience. This fast growth is
  due to the several advances that fNIRS offers over the other neuroimaging modalities
  such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography.
  In particular, fNIRS is harmless, tolerant to bodily movements, and highly portable,
  being suitable for all possible participant populations, from newborns to the elderly
  and experimental settings, both inside and outside the laboratory. In this review
  we aim to provide a comprehensive and state-of-the-art review of fNIRS basics, technical
  developments, and applications. In particular, we discuss some of the open challenges
  and the potential of fNIRS for cognitive neuroscience research, with a particular
  focus on neuroimaging in naturalistic environments and social cognitive neuroscience.
