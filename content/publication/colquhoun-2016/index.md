abstract: "Currently available near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) devices are unable\
  \ to discriminate between arterial and venous blood, a potential source of artifact.\
  \ The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that oscillations in NIR\
  \ signals at the respiratory and cardiac frequency could be attributed to venous\
  \ and arterial blood, respectively, and thereby isolated. After written informed\
  \ consent was obtained, a two-wavelength NIRS device was placed over the left frontal\
  \ cortex in 20 volunteers. After 5\_min of unimpeded spontaneous ventilation, an\
  \ impedance threshold device (ITD, average resistance\u20147\_cm H2O) was applied\
  \ and an additional two minutes of data recorded. Tissue saturation (StO2) calculated\
  \ at the ventilatory and cardiac frequencies was compared to non-pulsatile StO2,\
  \ before and after application of the ITD using spectral peak and power algorithms.\
  \ The ITD increased non-pulsatile cerebral saturation by 3.6\_%. The ITD had no\
  \ discernable effect on pulsatile estimates of StO2 at either the ventilatory or\
  \ cardiac frequencies. StO2 estimated at the NIRS spectral peak from 0.75 to 1.75\_\
  Hz was 24\_% higher than non-pulsatile StO2 (p\_=\_0.0013). There were no other\
  \ significant differences between pulsatile and non-pulsatile algorithms in the\
  \ estimation of StO2. In 64\_% of cases, both the low (ventilator) and high (cardiac)\
  \ frequency estimates of StO2 were either both larger or both smaller than non-pulsatile\
  \ StO2, suggesting that they were interrogating the same vascular bed. Frequency\
  \ domain analysis cannot reliably separate NIRS waveforms into arterial and venous\
  \ components."
