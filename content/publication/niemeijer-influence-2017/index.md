abstract: "Objective. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements of tissue oxygen\
  \ saturation (StO2) are useful for the assessment of skeletal muscle perfusion and\
  \ function during exercise, however, they are influenced by overlying skin and adipose\
  \ tissue. This study explored the extent and nature of the influence of adipose\
  \ tissue thickness (ATT) on StO2. Approach. NIR spatially resolved spectroscopy\
  \ (SRS) derived oxygenation was measured on vastus lateralis in 56 patients with\
  \ chronic heart failure (CHF) and 20 healthy control (HC) subjects during rest and\
  \ moderate intensity exercise with simultaneous assessment of oxygen uptake kinetics\
  \ ($\u03C4$ ). In vitro measurements were performed on a flow cell with a blood\
  \ mixture with full oxygen saturation (100%), which was gradually decreased to 0%\
  \ by adding sodium metabisulfite. Experiments were repeated with 2 mm increments\
  \ of porcine fat layer between the NIRS device and flow cell up to 14 mm. Main results.\
  \ Lower ATT, higher $\u03C4$ , and CHF were independently associated with lower\
  \ in vivo StO2 in multiple regression analysis, whereas age and gender showed no\
  \ independent relationship. With greater ATT, in vitro StO2 was reduced from 100%\
  \ to 74% for fully oxygenated blood and increased from 0% to 68% for deoxygenated\
  \ blood. Significance. This study shows that ATT independently confounds NIR-SRS\
  \ derived StO2 by overestimating actual skeletal muscle oxygenation and by decreasing\
  \ its sensitivity for deoxygenation. Because physiological properties (e.g. presence\
  \ of disease and slowing of $\u03C4$ ) also influence NIR-SRS, a correction based\
  \ on optical properties is needed to interpret calculated values as absolute StO2."
