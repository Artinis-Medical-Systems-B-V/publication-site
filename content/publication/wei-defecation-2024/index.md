abstract: 'Constipation is correlated with diminished cognitive function, revealing
  a possible rectum-brain connection. In this counter-balanced crossover trial, 13
  elite triathletes underwent a Stroop test to assess cognitive function and executive
  control. The Stroop test was conducted both with and without magnesium oxide intake,
  with a 1-week washout period between sessions. Oxygenation and blood distribution
  during the cognitive challenge were measured using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS).
  Measurements were taken in both the prefrontal brain and the sub-navel region, where
  the highest glucose uptake was detected under the 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron
  Emission Tomography (PET) scan. A significant reduction in completion time for the
  Stroop test was observed after defecation compared to the non-defecated condition
  (non-defecation: [27.1 ​± ​1.1] s; non-magnesium defecation: [24.4 ​± ​0.9] s; magnesium
  defecation: [23.4 ​± ​0.8] s, p ​textless ​0.05). Stroop test performance was improved
  in all (100%, 13/13) of the participants after magnesium-induced defecation and
  most (69%, 9/13) of the participants after non-magnesium-induced defecation. While
  no alterations in oxygenation and blood distribution were observed in the prefrontal
  brain during the Stroop test, decreased oxygenation levels were observed in the
  sub-navel region under both defecated conditions, without significant changes in
  blood distribution (p ​textless ​0.05). This data suggests an acute increase in
  oxygen consumption at this specific region. The result of this study suggests an
  unexplored causal link between the state of the rectum and cognitive performance.
  Magnesium supplementation to improved rectal emptying presents a novel application
  for optimizing cognitive function in athletes navigating intricate racing conditions.'
