abstract: "This study aims to examine the neural correlates of cognitive shifting\
  \ during the Dimensional Change Card Sort Task (DCCS) task with functional near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy. Altogether 49 children completed the DCCS tasks, and 25 children\
  \ (Mage = 68.66, SD = 5.3) passing all items were classified into the Switch group.\
  \ Twenty children (Mage = 62.05, SD = 8.13) committing more than one perseverative\
  \ errors were grouped into the Perseverate group. The Switch group had Brodmann\
  \ Area (BA) 9 and 10 activated in the pre-switch period and BA 6, 9, 10, 40, and\
  \ 44 in the post-switch period. In contrast, the Perseverate group had BA 9 and\
  \ 10 activated in the pre-switch period and BA 8, 9, 10 in the post-switch period.\
  \ The general linear model results afford strong support to the \u201CV-shape curve\u201D\
  \ hypothesis by identifying a significant decrease\u2013increase cycle in BA 9 and\
  \ 44, the neural correlations of cognitive shifting."
