abstract: Naturalistic stimulation (i.e., movies and auditory narratives of some minutes’
  length) has been a powerful approach to bringing more real-life experiences into
  laboratory experiments. Data-driven, intersubject correlation (ISC) analysis permits
  examining to what extent activity in a specific brain region correlates across participants
  during exposure to a naturalistic stimulus, as well as testing whether neural activity
  correlates with behavioral measures. Notably, most of the previous research with
  naturalistic stimuli was conducted using functional fMRI (fMRI). Here, we tested
  whether a naturalistic approach and the ISC are feasible using functional near-infrared
  spectroscopy (fNIRS) - the imaging method particularly suited for populations of
  patients and children. Fifty-three healthy adult participants watched twice a 3-min
  segment of a Charlie Chaplin movie while we recorded the brain activity on the surface
  of their prefrontal cortex using fNIRS. In addition, an independent group of 18
  participants used a continuous scoring procedure to rate the extent to which they
  felt that different parts of the movie fragment were funny. Our two findings were
  as follows. First, we found higher-than-zero ISC in fNIRS signals in the prefrontal
  cortex lobes, a result that was particularly high in the oxygenated channels during
  the first repetition of the movie. Second, we found a significant negative correlation
  between oxygenated brain signals and ratings of the movie’s humorousness. In a series
  of control analyses we demonstrated that this latter correlation could not be explained
  by various non-humor-related movie sensory properties (e.g., auditory volume and
  image brightness). The key overall outcome of the present study is that fNIRS in
  combination with the naturalistic paradigms and the ISC might be a sensitive and
  powerful research method to explore cognitive processing. Our results also suggest
  a potential role of the prefrontal cortex in humor appreciation.
