abstract: Purpose Aging is typically accompanied by risk for cardiovascular disease
  (CVD), which both are associated with reduced muscle oxygen saturation (SmO2) during
  exercise recovery. However, the apart impact of aging and CVD risk factors on muscle
  reoxygenation parameters during exercise recovery have not been addressed yet.  Methods
  Twenty healthy young individuals (34 ± 11 years), 20 older adults free from (67 ± 4
  years), and 25 others at risk for CVD (67 ± 5 years) participated in the study.
  Near-infrared spectroscopy was utilized to evaluate forearm muscle oxygen saturation
  during handgrip exercise performed at 30% maximal voluntary contraction. Participants
  performed one set of rhythmic handgrip exercises until fatigue following 2 min of
  recovery. The oxygen resaturation rate during exercise recovery (SmO2RR) was calculated
  as the linear upslope of the SmO2 value over the first 5 s immediately following
  exercise.  Results SmO2RR was significantly faster in healthy young as compared
  to older adults free from CVD (P = 0.027, d = 0.69) and older adults at risk for
  CVD (P textless 0.001, d = 1.25), with moderate to very large effect size. No significant
  difference in SmO2RR between the older adults group (P = 0.226) was observed, despite
  a large effect size (d = 0.87).  Conclusion The findings of the current study demonstrated
  that aging, independently of the presence of CVD risk factors, negatively affects
  muscle oxygen resaturation after exercise. However, the effect of CVD risk factors
  on muscle SmO2 following exercise should not be neglected.
