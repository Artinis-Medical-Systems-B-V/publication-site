The main purpose of the current study was to investigate the dynamic adjustment of pulmonary oxygen uptake (

) in response to moderate-intensity cycling on three occasions within 15 months in competitive youth cyclists. Furthermore, the muscle Δdeoxy[heme] on-kinetics and the Δdeoxy[heme]-to-

Eleven cyclists (initial age, 14.3 ± 1.6 y; peak

Conclusion

This suggests that improvements in muscle oxygen provision and utilization capacity both occurred, and each may have contributed to enhancing the dynamic adjustment of the oxidative “machinery” in competitive youth cyclists. Furthermore, it indicates a strong link between an oxygen maldistribution within the tissue of interrogation and the
