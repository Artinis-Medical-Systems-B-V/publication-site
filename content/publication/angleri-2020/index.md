abstract: "Metabolic stress is a primary mechanism of muscle hypertrophy and is associated\
  \ with microvascular oxygenation and muscle activation. Considering that drop-set\
  \ (DS) and crescent pyramid (CP) resistance training systems are recommended to\
  \ modulate these mechanisms related to muscle hypertrophy, we aimed to investigate\
  \ if these resistance training systems produce a different microvascular oxygenation\
  \ status and muscle activation from those observed in traditional resistance training\
  \ (TRAD). Twelve volunteers had their legs randomized in an intra-subject cross-over\
  \ design in TRAD (3 sets of 10 repetitions at 75% 1-RM), DS (3 sets of \u223C50-75%\
  \ 1-RM) and CP (3 sets of 6-10 repetitions at 75-85% 1-RM). Vastus medialis microvascular\
  \ oxygenation and muscle activation were respectively assessed by non-invasive near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy and surface electromyography techniques during the resistance training\
  \ sessions in the leg-extension exercise. Total hemoglobin area under the curve\
  \ (AUC) (TRAD: -1653.5 \xB1 2866.5; DS: -3069.2 \xB1 3429.4; CP: -1196.6 \xB1 2675.3)\
  \ and tissue oxygen saturation (TRAD: 19283.1 \xB1 6698.0; DS: 23995.5 \xB1 15604.9;\
  \ CP: 16109.1 \xB1 8553.1) increased without differences between protocols (p>0.05).\
  \ Greater decreases in oxygenated hemoglobin AUC and hemoglobin differentiated AUC\
  \ were respectively found for DS (-4036.8 \xB1 2698.1; -5004.4 \xB1 2722.9) compared\
  \ with TRAD (-1951.8 \xB1 1720.0; -2250.3 \xB1 1305.7) and CP (-1814.4 \xB1 2634.3;\
  \ 2432.2 \xB1 2891.4) (p<0.03). Higher increases of hemoglobin deoxygenated AUC\
  \ were found for DS (1426.7 \xB1 1320.7) compared with TRAD (316.0 \xB1 1164.9)\
  \ only (p=0.04). No differences were demonstrated in electromyographic amplitudes\
  \ between TRAD (69.0 \xB1 34.4), DS (61.3 \xB1 26.7) and CP (60.9 \xB1 38.8) (p>0.05).\
  \ Despite DS produced lower microvascular oxygenation levels compared with TRAD\
  \ and CP, all protocols produced similar muscle activation levels."
