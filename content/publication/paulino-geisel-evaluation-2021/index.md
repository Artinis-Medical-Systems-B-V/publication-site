abstract: Objective Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is characterized by intermittent
  claudication, which interferes with walking and leads to worsening of functional
  capacity. This mechanism has not been clearly defined in PAD. Thus, the aim of our
  study was to identify the muscular metabolism and vascular function variables using
  near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and their possible associations with functional
  capacity in individuals with PAD and secondly to verify the differences in these
  variables between persons with PAD and diabetes mellitus (DM) and those with PAD
  without DM.  Methods A total of 39 participants with intermittent claudication were
  enrolled, 14 of whom had DM. They were assessed for functional capacity by the total
  distance covered in the treadmill test with the speed and grade constant and for
  muscle function and metabolism using near-infrared spectroscopy at rest and during
  the treadmill test. The Spearman correlation coefficient was computed to assess
  the presence of an association between the variables, and multiple linear regression
  analysis was performed, considering the total test distance as the dependent variable.
  The assessment between groups was performed using the independent t test or Mann-Whitney
  U test.  Results The near-infrared spectroscopy variables related to tissue oxygen
  saturation in the test recovery phase were correlated with the functional performance
  during the treadmill test. Thus, those with a longer or slower recovery time and
  those with greater tissue deoxygenation had walked a shorter distance. A significant
  difference (P = .049) was noted between those with PAD stratified by DM in the reoxygenation
  time required for an occlusion.  Conclusions These findings reinforce the hypothesis
  that peripheral factors related to vascular function and muscular metabolism can
  affect the walking capacity of persons with PAD and that microvascular dysfunction
  is more prevalent among those with PAD and DM.
