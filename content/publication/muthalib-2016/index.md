abstract: "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive electrical\
  \ brain stimulation technique that can modulate cortical neuronal excitability and\
  \ activity. This study utilized functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging\
  \ to determine the effects of anodal high-definition (HD)-tDCS on bilateral sensorimotor\
  \ cortex (SMC) activation. Before (Pre), during (Online), and after (Offline) anodal\
  \ HD-tDCS (2 mA, 20 min) targeting the left SMC, eight healthy subjects performed\
  \ a simple finger sequence (SFS) task with their right or left hand in an alternating\
  \ blocked design (30-s rest and 30-s SFS task, repeated five times). In order to\
  \ determine the level of bilateral SMC activation during the SFS task, an Oxymon\
  \ MkIII fNIRS system was used to measure from the left and right SMC, changes in\
  \ oxygenated (O2Hb) and deoxygenated (HHb) haemoglobin concentration values. The\
  \ fNIRS data suggests a finding that compared to the Pre condition both the \u201C\
  Online\u201D and \u201COffline\u201D anodal HD-tDCS conditions induced a significant\
  \ reduction in bilateral SMC activation (i.e., smaller decrease in HHb) for a similar\
  \ motor output (i.e., SFS tap rate). These findings could be related to anodal HD-tDCS\
  \ inducing a greater efficiency of neuronal transmission in the bilateral SMC to\
  \ perform the same SFS task."
