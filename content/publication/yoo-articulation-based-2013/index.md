abstract: "Verbal repetition is a fundamental language capacity where listening and\
  \ speaking are inextricably coupled with each other. We have recently reported that\
  \ the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) harbors articulation-based codes, as evidenced\
  \ by activation during repetition of meaningless speech sounds, i.e., pseudowords.\
  \ In this study, we aimed at confirming this finding and further investigating the\
  \ possibility that sound perception as well as articulation is subserved by neural\
  \ circuits in this region. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS),\
  \ we monitored changes of hemoglobin (Hb) concentration at IFG bilaterally, while\
  \ subjects verbally repeated pseudowords and words. The results revealed that the\
  \ proportion of oxygenated hemoglobin (O<inf>2</inf>Hb) over total Hb was significantly\
  \ higher at the left IFG during repetition of pseudowords than that of words, replicating\
  \ the observation by functional MRI and indicating that the region processes articulatory\
  \ codes for verbal repetition. More importantly for this study, hemodynamic modulations\
  \ were observed at both IFG during passive listening without repetition to various\
  \ sounds, including natural environmental sounds, animal vocalizations, and human\
  \ non-speech sounds. Furthermore, the O<inf>2</inf>Hb concentration increased at\
  \ the left IFG but decreased at the right IFG for both speech and non-speech sounds.\
  \ These findings suggest that both speech and non-speech sounds may be processed\
  \ and maintained by a neural mechanism for sensorimotor integration using articulatory\
  \ codes at the left IFG. \xA9 2013 Yoo and Lee."
