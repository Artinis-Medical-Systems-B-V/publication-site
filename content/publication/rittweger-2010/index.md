abstract: "Summary: Exposure to vibration has traditionally been associated with compromised\
  \ perfusion. This study investigated whether blood supply during whole body vibration\
  \ (WBV), as an exercise modality, is in proportion to the metabolic demand by the\
  \ contracting musculature. As a secondary aim, serum levels of vascular endothelial\
  \ growth factor (VEGF) were assessed. Ten young healthy males performed WBV and\
  \ dynamic shallow squatting (Squat) exercise at comparable levels of oxygen uptake\
  \ for 3 min. Changes in oxygenated, deoxygenated and total haemoglobin (O2Hb, HHb\
  \ and tHb, respectively) along with tissue oxygenation index (TOI) were measured\
  \ continuously before, during and after the exercise by near-infrared spectroscopy\
  \ (NIRS, Portamon, Artinis Medical Systems, Zetten, The Netherlands). Vascular endothelial\
  \ growth factor-A blood levels before and after exercise were assessed by ELISA.\
  \ Oxygen uptake was comparable in Squat and WBV (11\u02D94 and 10\u02D97 ml kg-1\
  \ min-1), respectively, P = 0\u02D949), as were all other cardiopulmonary variables.\
  \ Near-infrared spectroscopy data were found to be non-stationary during and shortly\
  \ after WBV, but stationary in Squat. There was an increase in O2Hb and TOI, and\
  \ a decrease in HHb during the first 30 s of WBV, but no significant change was\
  \ observed during Squat. No group difference was found in VEGF serum levels. These\
  \ results suggest that oxygen supply during WBV is sufficient, and oxygenation is\
  \ even enhanced during the first approximately 30 s. Most likely, the transient\
  \ response is because of local vascular regulatory mechanisms and due to muscle\
  \ contraction mechanics. This might become clinically relevant under pathological\
  \ conditions, e.g. in vascular disorders. \xA9 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation\
