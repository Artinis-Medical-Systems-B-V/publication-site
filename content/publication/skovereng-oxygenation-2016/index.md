abstract: "Purpose: The present study investigates the effect of cadence on joint\
  \ specific power and oxygenation and local muscle oxygen consumption in the vastus\
  \ lateralis and vastus medialis in addition to the relationship between joint specific\
  \ power and local muscle oxygen consumption (mVO2). Methods: Seventeen recreationally\
  \ active cyclists performed 6 stages of constant load cycling using cadences of\
  \ 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 and 110\_rpm. Joint specific power was calculated using inverse\
  \ dynamics and mVO2 and oxygenation were measured using near-infrared spectroscopy.\
  \ Results: Increasing cadence led to increased knee joint power and decreased hip\
  \ joint power while the ankle joint was unaffected. Increasing cadence also led\
  \ to an increased deoxygenation in both the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis.\
  \ Vastus lateralis mVO2 increased when cadence was increased. No effect of cadence\
  \ was found for vastus medialis mVO2. Conclusion: This study demonstrates a different\
  \ effect of cadence on the mVO2 of the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis. The\
  \ combined mVO2 of the vastus lateralis and medialis showed a linear increase with\
  \ increasing knee joint specific power, demonstrating that the muscles combined\
  \ related to power generated over the joint."
