abstract: Impairments in cerebral autoregulation (CA) are related to poor clinical
  outcome. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive technique applied to
  estimate CA. Our general purpose was to study the clinical feasibility of a previously
  published ‘NIRS-only’ CA methodology in a critically ill intensive care unit (ICU)
  population and determine its relationship with clinical outcome. Bilateral NIRS
  measurements were performed for 1–2 h. Data segments of ten-minutes were used to
  calculate transfer function analyses (TFA) CA estimates between high frequency oxyhemoglobin
  (oxyHb) and deoxyhemoglobin (deoxyHb) signals. The phase shift was corrected for
  serial time shifts. Criteria were defined to select TFA phase plot segments (segments)
  with ‘high-pass filter’ characteristics. In 54 patients, 490 out of 729 segments
  were automatically selected (67%). In 34 primary neurology patients the median (q1–q3)
  low frequency (LF) phase shift was higher in 19 survivors compared to 15 non-survivors
  (13° (6.3–35) versus 0.83° (−2.8–13), p = 0.0167). CA estimation using the NIRS-only
  methodology seems feasible in an ICU population using segment selection for more
  robust and consistent CA estimations. The ‘NIRS-only’ methodology needs further
  validation, but has the advantage of being non-invasive without the need for arterial
  blood pressure monitoring.
