abstract: 'Significance: Multi-laboratory initiatives are essential in performance
  assessment and standardization—crucial for bringing biophotonics to mature clinical
  use—to establish protocols and develop reference tissue phantoms that all will allow
  universal instrument comparison.  Aim: The largest multi-laboratory comparison of
  performance assessment in near-infrared diffuse optics is presented, involving 28
  instruments and 12 institutions on a total of eight experiments based on three consolidated
  protocols (BIP, MEDPHOT, and NEUROPT) as implemented on three kits of tissue phantoms.
  A total of 20 synthetic indicators were extracted from the dataset, some of them
  defined here anew.  Approach: The exercise stems from the Innovative Training Network
  BitMap funded by the European Commission and expanded to include other European
  laboratories. A large variety of diffuse optics instruments were considered, based
  on different approaches (time domain/frequency domain/continuous wave), at various
  stages of maturity and designed for different applications (e.g., oximetry, spectroscopy,
  and imaging).  Results: This study highlights a substantial difference in hardware
  performances (e.g., nine decades in responsivity, four decades in dark count rate,
  and one decade in temporal resolution). Agreement in the estimates of homogeneous
  optical properties was within 12% of the median value for half of the systems, with
  a temporal stability of textless5  %   over 1 h, and day-to-day reproducibility
  of textless3  %  . Other tests encompassed linearity, crosstalk, uncertainty, and
  detection of optical inhomogeneities.  Conclusions: This extensive multi-laboratory
  exercise provides a detailed assessment of near-infrared Diffuse optical instruments
  and can be used for reference grading. The dataset—available soon in an open data
  repository—can be evaluated in multiple ways, for instance, to compare different
  analysis tools or study the impact of hardware implementations.'
