abstract: "Purpose: Exercise training improves endothelium-dependent vasodilation,\
  \ whereas hypoxic stress causes vascular endothelial dysfunction. Monocyte-derived\
  \ endothelial progenitor cells (Mon-EPCs) contribute to vascular repair process\
  \ by differentiating into endothelial cells. This study investigates how high-intensity\
  \ interval (HIT) and moderate-intensity continuous (MCT) exercise training affect\
  \ circulating Mon-EPC levels and EPC functionality under hypoxic condition. Methods:\
  \ Sixty healthy sedentary males were randomized to engage in either HIT (3-min intervals\
  \ at 40 and 80\_% VO2max for five repetitions, n\_=\_20) or MCT (sustained 60\_\
  % VO2max, n\_=\_20) for 30\_min/day, 5\_days/week for 6\_weeks, or to a control\
  \ group (CTL) that did not received exercise intervention (n\_=\_20). Mon-EPC characteristics\
  \ and EPC functionality under hypoxic exercise (HE, 100\_W under 12\_% O2) were\
  \ determined before and after HIT, MCT, and CTL. Results: The results demonstrated\
  \ that after the intervention, the HIT group exhibited larger improvements in VO2peak,\
  \ estimated peak cardiac output (QC), and estimated peak perfusions of frontal cerebral\
  \ lobe (QFC) and vastus lateralis (QVL) than the MCT group. Furthermore, HIT (a)\
  \ increased circulating CD14++/CD16\u2212/CD34+/KDR+ (Mon-1 EPC) and CD14++/CD16+/CD34+/KDR+\
  \ (Mon-2 EPC) cell counts, (b) promoted the migration and tube formation of EPCs,\
  \ (c) diminished the shedding of endothelial (CD34\u2212/KDR+/phosphatidylserine+)\
  \ cells, and (d) elevated plasma nitrite plus nitrate, stromal cell-derived factor-1,\
  \ matrix metalloproteinase-9, and vascular endothelial growth factor-A concentrations\
  \ at rest or following HE, compared to those of MCT. In addition, Mon-1 and -2 EPC\
  \ counts were directly related to VO2peak and estimated peak QC, QFC, and QVL. Conclusions:\
  \ HIT is superior to MCT for improving hemodynamic adaptation and Mon-EPC production.\
  \ Moreover, HIT effectively enhances EPC functionality and suppresses endothelial\
  \ injury undergoing hypoxia."
