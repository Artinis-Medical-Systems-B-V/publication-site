 abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate three passive upper-extremity exoskeletons relative to a control condition. Twelve subjects performed an hour-long, simulated occupational task ina laboratory setting. Independent measures of exoskeleton, exertion height (overhead, head height), time, and their interactions were assessed. Dependent measures included changes in tis-sue oxygenation (DTSI) in the anterior deltoid and middle trapezius, peak resultant lumbar spine loading, and subjective discomfort in various body regions. A statistically significant reduction inDTSI between exoskeleton and control was only observed in one instance. Additionally, neither increases in spinal loading nor increases in subjective discomfort ratings were observed for anyof the exoskeletons. Ultimately, the exoskeletons offered little to no physiological benefit for the conditions tested. However, the experimental task was not highly fatiguing to the subjects, denoted by low DTSI values across conditions. Results may vary for tasks requiring constant arm elevation or higher force demands.},
