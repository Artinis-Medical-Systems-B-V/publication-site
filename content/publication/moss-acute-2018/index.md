abstract: 'Background: The use of herbal extracts and supplements to enhance health
  and wellbeing is increasing in western society. Aims: This study investigated the
  impact of the acute ingestion of a commercially available water containing an extract
  and hydrolat of rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L. syn. Salvia rosmarinus Schleid.).
  Aspects of cognitive functioning, mood and cerebrovascular response measured by
  near-infrared spectroscopy provided the dependent variables. Methods: Eighty healthy
  adults were randomly allocated to consume either 250 mL of rosemary water or plain
  mineral water. They then completed a series of computerised cognitive tasks, followed
  by subjective measures of alertness and fatigue. Near-infrared spectroscopy monitored
  levels of total, oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin at baseline and throughout
  the cognitive testing procedure. Results: Analysis of the data revealed a number
  of statistically significant, small, beneficial effects of rosemary water on cognition,
  consistent with those found previously for the inhalation of the aroma of rosemary
  essential oil. Of particular interest here are the cerebrovascular effects noted
  for deoxygenated haemoglobin levels during cognitive task performance that were
  significantly higher in the rosemary water condition. This represents a novel finding
  in this area, and may indicate a facilitation of oxygen extraction at times of cognitive
  demand. Conclusion: Taken together the data suggest potential beneficial properties
  of acute consumption of rosemary water. The findings are discussed in terms of putative
  metabolic and cholinergic mechanisms.'
