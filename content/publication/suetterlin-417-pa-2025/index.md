abstract: Grip strength is a simple and inexpensive clinical test. However, by limiting
  measurement to the force of an isolated contraction, we are missing functionally,
  and mechanistically relevant information. Skeletal muscle ATP consumption can increase
  100-fold with exercise and the majority of this ATP is generated in mitochondria
  by oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore, repeated intermittent contraction may be
  more likely to detect underlying mitochondrial dysfunction. Near-infra-red spectroscopy
  (NIRs) has been used to detect mitochondrial dysfunction previously. Combining NIRs
  of the forearm muscles with a handgrip exercise protocol may provide a non-invasive
  measure of mitochondrial function. To explore whether a handgrip exercise protocol
  with continuous force and NIRs measurement can reliably distinguish mitochondrial
  myopathy patients from age and sex-matched controls. We used a 3-minute handgrip
  exercise protocol (squeeze 1 second at 40% maximal voluntary contraction, relax
  1 second). We combined this with continuous force measurement using a digital dynamometer
  with a sampling frequency of 200Hz and Artinis Portamon Near-Infra Red Spectroscopy
  (NIRs). We compared 10 people with genetic mitochondrial myopathy and exercise intolerance
  with 20 age and sex-matched healthy controls. Force and NIRs measurements were combined
  and analysed in a specifically designed Matlab app. Initial analysis shows the total
  force (area under curve) over a 3-minute handgrip exercise protocol was significantly
  and consistently less in patients with genetically confirmed mitochondrial disease.
  The forearm flexor compartment NIRs Tissue Saturation Index (TSI) was not significantly
  different between groups. However, NIRs effect appeared to vary significantly between
  patients. The 'total' force after 3 minutes of a hand-grip exercise protocol may
  be a useful biomarker in mitochondrial disease. Although there was no significant
  group difference in NIRs TSI between people with genetically confirmed mitochondrial
  disease and healthy controls, there was a subset of mitochondrial patients who exhibited
  minimal change in TSI over the forearm exercise test (Figure 9). Exploratory analysis
  on the link between genotype, phenotype and NIRs response profile will be performed.
