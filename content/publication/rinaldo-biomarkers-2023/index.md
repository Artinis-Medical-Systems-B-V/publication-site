abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a progressive atherosclerotic disease
  that affects textgreater8 million Americans.1 Symptoms of PAD are caused by insufficient
  arterial blood flow to the lower extremities, which often results in ischemia-induced,
  debilitating leg discomfort associated with walking. Claudication, which is cramping,
  aching, or pain in the calves, thighs, or buttocks, is the classic symptom of PAD.
  Claudication is defined as a reproducible discomfort or fatigue in the muscles of
  the lower extremity that occurs with exertion and is relieved within 10 minutes
  of rest.2 Most people with PAD do not have classic claudication symptoms but still
  have significantly greater functional impairment and decline than people without
  PAD. This significant physical activity limitation results in functional impairment,
  mobility loss, and decreased quality of life. Improving functioning and quality
  of life is a major goal in the treatment of individuals with PAD.3,4  The evidence
  supporting the efficacy of exercise therapy for patients with PAD dates back to
  1966 when 6 months of unsupervised intermittent walking exercise was demonstrated
  to improve time walked to onset of pain and peak walking time (PWT).5 Over the 50
  years since that first report, numerous randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses
  have added to the body of evidence supporting the efficacy of exercise to improve
  functioning and quality of life in patients with PAD.
