abstract: "Motor and cognitive tasks often interfere when performed concurrently.\
  \ The amount of interference typically scales with difficulty of the tasks involved.\
  \ Thus, supposedly \u2018easy' motor tasks with restricted movement amplitude, like\
  \ sitting on a chair, should show little or no interference with cognitive tasks\
  \ at all. We measured the processing load induced by different postural tasks and\
  \ their effect on cognitive performance under cognitive\u2013motor dual-task conditions.\
  \ Sixteen subjects performed postural motor tasks in three different positions:\
  \ \u2018Lying in a sun lounger', \u2018Sitting on a bike saddle', and \u2018Upright\
  \ on feet'. In each position, three different movement instructions were given;\
  \ \u2018Stay stock-still', \u2018Relax', \u2018Move easily'. Each combination of\
  \ position and instruction was performed as single task but also in a dual-task\
  \ condition with a concurrent calculation task. Brain activity in the right prefrontal\
  \ cortex was monitored using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. The instruction\
  \ to \u2018Stay stock-still' produced higher cortical loads in single-task conditions\
  \ for all positions compared to all other instructions. The calculation task induced\
  \ additional brain activity in the same prefrontal area as the motor task. Calculation\
  \ performance tended to be reduced in the \u2018LyingStay stock-still' condition.\
  \ We discuss the relevance of these findings for learning scenarios in school."
