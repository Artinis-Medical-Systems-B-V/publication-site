abstract: 'Background : Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has recognized potential
  but limited application for non-invasive diagnostic evaluation. Data analysis methodology
  that reproducibly distinguishes between the presence or absence of physiologic abnormality
  could broaden clinical application of this optical technique. Methods : Sample data
  sets from simultaneous NIRS bladder monitoring and invasive urodynamic pressure-flow
  studies (UDS) are used to illustrate how a diagnostic algorithm is constructed using
  classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. Misclassification errors of
  CART and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) are computed and examples of other urological
  NIRS data likely amenable to CART analysis presented. Results : CART generated a
  clinically relevant classification algorithm (error 4%) using 46 data sets of changes
  in chromophore concentration composed of the whole time series without specifying
  features. LDA did not (error 16%). Using CART NIRS data provided comparable discriminant
  ability to the UDS diagnostic nomogram for the presence or absence of obstructive
  pathology (88% specificity, 84% precision). Pilot data examples from children with
  and without voiding dysfunction and women with mild or severe pelvic floor muscle
  dysfunction also show potentially diagnostic differences in chromophore concentration.
  Conclusions : CART analysis can likely be applied in other NIRS monitoring applications
  intended to classify patients into those with and without pathology. '
