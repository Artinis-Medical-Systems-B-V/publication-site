Studies exploring variations in peripheral muscle oxygenation and pressure pain thresholds (PPT) of masticatory muscles in individuals with Temporomandibular Disorders (TMDs) are limited. The purpose of this study was to compare variations in peripheral oxygenation of the masseter muscle; PPT of the masseter and temporal muscles and correlate peripheral muscle oxygenation and PPT of the masseter muscle in individuals with different types of TMDs.
Materials and methods
Cross-sectional study involving 116 participants classified into three groups: muscle group (MG, n = 32), joint group (JG, n = 30) and muscle-joint group (MJG, n = 54). Individuals aged 26.97 ± 6.93, 68.97% female, 31,03% males were included. All participants were evaluated using the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders, Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for peripheral muscle oxygenation and pressure algometer for PPT.
Results
There was no difference in masseter muscle oxygenation among groups. In the masseter muscle, a weakly positive correlation was observed between PPT and variation in tissue saturation index in the MG (rho = 0.365) and JG (rho = 0.317). In addition, the MJG expressed lower PPT (p = 0.004) than JG, demonstrating that MJG had more pain in this muscle.
Conclusions
MJG have lower PPT in the masseter muscle. Although the PPT is dependent on the type of TMDs, the correlation between PPT and oxygenation is weak. All TMDs groups evaluated (MG, JG, MJG) showed hemodynamic similarities of the masseter muscle.},
