abstract: 'Objectives Studies exploring variations in peripheral muscle oxygenation
  and pressure pain thresholds (PPT) of masticatory muscles in individuals with Temporomandibular
  Disorders (TMDs) are limited. The purpose of this study was to compare variations
  in peripheral oxygenation of the masseter muscle; PPT of the masseter and temporal
  muscles and correlate peripheral muscle oxygenation and PPT of the masseter muscle
  in individuals with different types of TMDs. Materials and methods Cross-sectional
  study involving 116 participants classified into three groups: muscle group (MG,
  n = 32), joint group (JG, n = 30) and muscle-joint group (MJG, n = 54). Individuals
  aged 26.97 ± 6.93, 68.97% female, 31,03% males were included. All participants were
  evaluated using the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders, Near-infrared
  spectroscopy (NIRS) for peripheral muscle oxygenation and pressure algometer for
  PPT. Results There was no difference in masseter muscle oxygenation among groups.
  In the masseter muscle, a weakly positive correlation was observed between PPT and
  variation in tissue saturation index in the MG (rho = 0.365) and JG (rho = 0.317).
  In addition, the MJG expressed lower PPT (p = 0.004) than JG, demonstrating that
  MJG had more pain in this muscle. Conclusions MJG have lower PPT in the masseter
  muscle. Although the PPT is dependent on the type of TMDs, the correlation between
  PPT and oxygenation is weak. All TMDs groups evaluated (MG, JG, MJG) showed hemodynamic
  similarities of the masseter muscle.'
