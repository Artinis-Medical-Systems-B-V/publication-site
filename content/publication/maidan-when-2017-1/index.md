abstract: "Turning has been implicated as a complex task that requires both motor\
  \ and cognitive resources. Accumulating evidence shows that patients with Parkinson's\
  \ disease (PD) require more steps and more time to complete a turn, however, the\
  \ role of the prefrontal cortex during turning is not clear. Forty nine patients\
  \ with PD without freezing of gait (mean age 71.7 \xB1 1.0 years; 67% men, disease\
  \ duration 9.7 \xB1 1.3 years) performed motor and cognitive tests. Prefrontal activation,\
  \ specifically in Brodmann area 10 (BA10), during turning and usual walking was\
  \ measured using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The patients with\
  \ PD were further divided into two subgroups with high and low functional status\
  \ based on limitations in community ambulation. General Linear Model analysis adjusted\
  \ for age, gender, disease duration and turn duration was used to assess differences\
  \ between tasks and subgroups of patients with PD. In addition, Pearson's correlation\
  \ was performed to assess association between BA10 activation and motor and cognitive\
  \ scores. Activation in BA10 increased during walking (p < 0.001), while it decreased\
  \ during turning (p = 0.006). A comparison between the two subgroups of patients\
  \ with PD revealed that patients with relatively better ambulation decreased prefrontal\
  \ activation during turning, as compared to patients with relatively worse ambulation\
  \ (p < 0.001). These findings are the first to show that BA10 plays a different\
  \ role during turning and walking and that ambulation status may alter BA10 activation\
  \ during turning. Higher prefrontal activation during turning in the subgroup of\
  \ patients with relatively worse ambulation may reflect a compensatory attempt at\
  \ improving performance."
