abstract: The sensitivity of Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) signals to motion artifact
  can limit practical applications of NIRS monitoring. We describe a wavelet based
  method for removing motion artifact from NIRS signals. This method was tested on
  monitoring data collected from leg muscle in 3 patients undergoing surgery to stabilize
  leg fractures. The results show an average of 18.36 dB attenuation in motion artifact
  energy in the NIRS signal for our test subjects when using the proposed method,
  without the introduction of significant distortion in the artifact-free regions
  of the signal.
