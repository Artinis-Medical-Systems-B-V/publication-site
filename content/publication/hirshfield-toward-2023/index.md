abstract: We investigate the utility of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
  for workload-based adaptive automation through the lens of multiple resource theory.
  We focus on the criteria of unobtrusiveness, responsiveness, load sensitivity (low
  vs high load), and load diagnosticity (differentiating types of load). We report
  a large meta-review, in which we conclude that only a few studies were suitable
  for evaluating sensitivity and diagnosticity in complex real-world tasks. While
  these reveal that the fNIRS signal is adequately sensitive to gradations of load
  level changes (sensitivity), the diagnosticity of fNIRS to different sources of
  cognitive load remained uncertain. We manipulated mental load of a complex shape
  sorting task via working memory load (WM) and visual perceptual load (VL), while
  a secondary auditory task was present throughout. We measured the effect of these
  manipulations at the group-level using conventional secondary and eyetracking workload
  measures, as well as hemodynamic response in specific functional regions in the
  brain, including regions involved in multi-tasking (MT), VL, WM, and auditory load
  (AL). Our findings revealed that fNIRS is both sensitive and diagnostic to load
  in complex tasks, with greater sensitivity revealed by deoxyhemoglobin than oxyhemoglobin
  and the brain regions associated with diagnosticity align with neuroscience literature
  on perceptual load, WM, and goal-directed multitasking.
