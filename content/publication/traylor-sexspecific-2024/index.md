abstract: 'Objective: We examined sex‐specific microvascular reactivity and hemodynamic
  responses under conditions of augmented resting blood flow induced by passive heating
  compared to normal blood flow. Methods:Thirty‐eight adults (19 females) completed
  a vascular occlusion test (VOT) on two occasions preceded by rest with or without
  passive heating in a randomized, counterbalanced order. Skeletal muscle tissue oxygenation
  (StO2, %) was assessed with near‐infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and the rate of desaturation
  and resaturation as well as maximal StO2 (StO2max) and prolonged hypersaturation
  (area under the curve, StO2AUC) were quantified. Before the VOT, brachial artery
  blood flow (BABF), vascular conductance, and relative BABF (BABF normalized to forearm
  lean mass) were determined. Sex × condition ANOVAs were used. A p‐value ≤.05 was
  considered statistically significant. Results: Twenty minutes of heating increased
  BABF compared to the control (102.9 ± 28.3 vs. 36.0 ± 20.9 mL min −1; p textless .01).
  Males demonstrated greater BABF than females (91.9 ± 34.0 vs. 47.0 ± 19.1 mL min
  −1; p textless .01). There was no sex difference in normalized BABF. There were
  no significant interactions for NIRS‐VOT outcomes, but heat did increase the rate
  of desaturation (−0.140 ± 0.02 vs. −0.119 ± 0.03% s −1; p textless .01), whereas
  regardless of condition, males exhibited greater rates of resaturation and StO2max
  than females. Conclusions: These results suggest that blood flow is not the primary
  factor causing sex differences in NIRS‐VOT outcomes.'
