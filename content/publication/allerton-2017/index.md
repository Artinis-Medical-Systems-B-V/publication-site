abstract: "Metabolic inflexibility is an emerging physiological marker indicative\
  \ of metabolic dysfunction and associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity.\
  \ Exercise is a potent stimulus to improve metabolic health, however, not much is\
  \ known about the acute effects of exercise on metabolic flexibility (METFLEX).\
  \ The purpose of this dissertation was study the time-course of diet and exercise\
  \ and its effects on METFLEX. Three studies were conducted to investigate molecular\
  \ and clinical aspects of diet and exercise and how these stimuli may alter the\
  \ metabolic response to fuel. The first study was conducted on obesity-prone, Osborne-Mendel\
  \ (OM) and obesity-resistant S5B/Pl (S5B) rats. This experiment investigated inherent\
  \ differences in EE, metabolic rate, METFLEX and skeletal muscle markers of metabolism,\
  \ lipid storage and lipid oxidation between OM and S5B, as well as HFD-induced strain\
  \ differences in these parameters. The consumption of a HFD in S5B rats increased\
  \ metabolic rate and EE and decreased metabolic rate and EE in OM rats. These strain\
  \ differences were not due to the differences in activity or food intake. These\
  \ results suggest that HFD-induced differences in metabolic rate and EE may be mediated\
  \ by HFD-induced differences in pAMPK and PPAR$\u03B3$ expression and lipid accumulation\
  \ in the gastrocnemius muscle of OM and S5B rats. The second study was designed\
  \ to investigate the effect of acute aerobic exercise at an intensity that maximizes\
  \ the rate of fat oxidation (FATMAX) on glucose tolerance, insulin action, and METFLEX\
  \ compared to acute aerobic exercise at lactate threshold (OBLA) resulting in greater\
  \ carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation. OBLA exercise appears to have deleterious effects\
  \ on oral glucose tolerance and metabolic flexibility acutely, however, FM exercise\
  \ does not confer improved METFLEX. These results suggest that predominate substrate\
  \ utilization does not promote improved glucose tolerance and metabolic flexibility\
  \ in young overweight men. The third and final study of this dissertation was designed\
  \ to investigate the immediate and extended of a single bout of high intensity interval\
  \ exercise (HIIE) on METFLEX and mitochondrial function. Participants were recruited\
  \ with a family history (FmHx) of T2D (n=8) and without a family history of T2D\
  \ (n=8). The extended effects (48 hours) work via the reduction fat oxidation by\
  \ increasing resting fat oxidation rate and improving the suppression of fat oxidation\
  \ in response to a mixed meal."
