abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is typically characterized by impairments
  in social interaction and communication, which may be associated with a failure
  to naturally orient to social stimuli, particularly in recognizing and responding
  to facial emotions. As most previous studies have used nonsocial stimuli to investigate
  inhibitory control in children and adults with ASD, little is known about the behavioral
  and neural activation patterns of emotional inhibitory control in adolescent with
  ASD. Functional neuroimaging studies have underscored the key role of the prefrontal
  cortex (PFC) in inhibitory control and emotional face processing. Thus, this study
  aimed to examine whether adolescent with ASD exhibited altered PFC processing during
  an emotional Flanker task by using non-invasive functional near-infrared spectroscopy
  (fNIRS). Twenty-one adolescents with high-functioning ASD and 26 typically developing
  (TD) adolescents aged 13â€“16 years were recruited. All participants underwent an
  emotional Flanker task, which required to decide whether the centrally positioned
  facial emotion is consistent with the laterally positioned facial emotion. TD adolescents
  exhibited larger RT and mean O2Hb level in the incongruent condition than the congruent
  condition, evoking cortical activations primarily in right PFC regions in response
  to the emotional Flanker effect. In contrast, ASD adolescents failed to exhibit
  the processing advantage for congruent versus incongruent emotional face in terms
  of RT, but showed cortical activations primarily in left PFC regions in response
  to the emotional Flanker effect. These findings suggest that adolescents with ASD
  rely on different neural strategies to mobilize PFC neural resources to address
  the difficulties they experience when inhibiting the emotional face.
