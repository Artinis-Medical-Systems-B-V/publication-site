abstract: Problematic smartphone use (PSU) is common among young people and linked
  to poor academic performance. However, how PSU affects learning processes remains
  unclear. This study investigated the influence of auditory cue stimulation during
  a reading task on the mental workload and prefrontal brain activity of young individuals
  with PSU. Sixteen university students with PSU and 14 healthy controls (HC) performed
  a silent reading task, during which fake notification sounds were introduced. Their
  mental workload was assessed using the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), and prefrontal
  brain activity was measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).
  The results of the NASA-TLX suggest that the PSU group experienced greater frustration
  than the HC group. The fNIRS results showed that in the right medial prefrontal
  region of the HC group, O2Hb levels increased following cue stimulation, whereas
  no change was observed in the PSU group. Moreover, in the HC group, HHb levels in
  the left lateral prefrontal region decreased after cue stimulation. The findings
  of the present study demonstrate that university students with PSU experience frustration
  and exhibit deactivation in the prefrontal regions associated with the executive
  control network during silent reading in realistic learning situations.
