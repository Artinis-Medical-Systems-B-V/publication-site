abstract: 'Aim Skeletal muscle blood volume responds to the metabolic demands of exercise
  and augmented microvasculature reactivity. We sought to explore the effects of exercise
  intensity (maximal vs. submaximal) on near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-derived
  blood volume and microvascular reactivity in the acute post-exercise timeframe.  Methods
  Healthy individuals (N = 18) between 18 and 35 years completed a vascular occlusion
  test (VOT) followed by a maximal cycling test. A second VOT was performed 15-min
  post-exercise. One week later, the protocol was repeated before and after a submaximal
  bout of cycling (60% VO2 peak). NIRS was used to assess total hemoglobin (tHb) (i.e.,
  blood volume) before, during, and after exercise, as well as muscle oxygen consumption
  (mVO2) and microvascular reactivity (StO2% s−1) pre- and post-exercise.  Results
  Compared with pre-exercise, tHb was elevated at the end of exercise (p textless 0.001)
  and remained elevated 15-min post-exercise (p textless 0.001) regardless of trial
  (combined means pre: 5.39 ± 0.82, during: 14.01 ± 1.73, and post-exercise: 10.89 ± 1.24
  O.D.). mVO2 was greater post-exercise in the max vs. submax trial (− 0.36 ± 0.12
  vs. − 0.22 ± 0.11% s−1; p textless 0.001). Compared with pre-exercise, microvascular
  reactivity was unchanged following the max trial (1.91 ± 0.61 vs. 1.71 ± 0.61% s−1;
  p = 0.079) but was greater following the submax trial (1.72 ± 0.43 vs. 1.98 ± 0.59;
  p = 0.007).  Conclusion Cycling at a submaximal, but not maximal, intensity results
  in augmented post-exercise microvascular reactivity, while post-exercise increases
  in skeletal muscle blood volume were found regardless of exercise intensity.'
