abstract: This study examined the impact of continuous blood flow restriction (BFR)
  during repeated‐sprint exercise (RSE) on acute performance, peripheral, systemic
  physiological, and perceptual responses. In a randomized crossover design, 26 adult
  male semi‐professional and amateur team‐sport players completed two RSE sessions
  (3 sets of 5 × 5‐s sprints with 25 s of passive recovery and 3 min of rest) with
  continuous BFR (45% arterial occlusion; excluding during between‐set rest periods)
  or without (non‐BFR). Mean and peak power output were significantly lower (p textless 0.001)
  during BFR compared to non‐BFR (dz = 0.85 and 0.77, respectively). Minimum tissue
  saturation index during the sprints and rest periods was significantly reduced (p textless 0.001)
  for BFR (dz = 1.26 and 1.21, respectively). Electromyography root mean square was
  significantly decreased (p textless 0.01) for biceps femoris and lateral gastrocnemius
  muscles during BFR (dz = 0.35 and 0.79, respectively), but remained unchanged for
  the vastus lateralis muscle in both conditions. Oxygen consumption and minute ventilation
  were significantly reduced (both p textless 0.01) for BFR (dz = 1.46 and 0.43, respectively).
  Perceived limb discomfort was significantly higher (p textless 0.001) for BFR (dz
  = 0.78). No differences (p textgreater 0.05) in blood lactate concentration or rating
  of perceived exertion were observed between conditions. Blood flow‐restricted RSE
  reduced performance and likely increased the physiological and perceptual stimulus
  for the periphery with greater reliance on anaerobic glycolysis, despite comparable
  or decreased systemic demands.
