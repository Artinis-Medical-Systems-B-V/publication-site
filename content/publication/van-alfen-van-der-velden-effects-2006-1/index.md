abstract: "Background: Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) is often used for correction of\
  \ metabolic acidosis in preterm infants. The effects of NaHCO 3 administration on\
  \ cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation are not well known. Furthermore, there is\
  \ no consensus on infusion rate of NaHCO 3. Objectives: To evaluate the effects\
  \ of rapid versus slow infusion of NaHCO3 on cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation\
  \ in preterm infants. Methods: Twenty-nine preterm infants with metabolic acidosis\
  \ were randomized into two groups (values are mean \xB1 SD): In group A (GA 30.5\
  \ \xB1 1.7 weeks, b.w. 1,254 \xB1 425 g) NaHCO3 4.2% was injected as a bolus. In\
  \ group B (GA 30.3 \xB1 1.8 weeks, b.w. 1,179 \xB1 318g) NaHCO3 4.2% was administered\
  \ over a 30-min period. Concentration changes of oxyhemoglobin (cO2Hb) and deoxyhemoglobin\
  \ (cHHb) were assessed using near infrared spectrophotometry. Changes in HbD (=\
  \ cO2Hb - cHHb) represent changes in cerebral blood oxygenation and changes in ctHb\
  \ (= cO2Hb + cHHb) reflect changes in cerebral blood volume. Cerebral blood flow\
  \ velocity was intermittently measured using Doppler ultrasound. Longitudinal data\
  \ analysis was performed using linear mixed models (SAS procedure MIXED), to account\
  \ for the fact that the repeated observations in each individual were correlated.\
  \ Results: Administration of NaHCO3 resulted in an increase of cerebral blood volume\
  \ which was more evident if NaHCO3 was injected rapidly than when infused slowly.\
  \ HbD and cerebral blood flow velocity did not show significant changes in either\
  \ group. Conclusion: To minimize fluctuations in cerebral hemodynamics, slow infusion\
  \ of sodium bicarbonate is preferable to rapid injection. Copyright \xA9 2006 S.\
