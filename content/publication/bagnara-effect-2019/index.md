abstract: We aimed at investigating the effect of a short time low load repetitive
  task on the local muscle oxygenation kinetics in presence of delayed onset muscle
  soreness. Computer work was investigated as a model of low load repetitive task.
  Nine healthy male subjects participated in an experimental protocol consisting of
  a rest period and two blocks, each including two maximum voluntary contractions
  (MVC) of isometric bilateral shoulder elevation and a computer work session with
  2 or 5 min duration between the MVCs in each block. Then a set of unaccustomed eccentric
  exercise (ECC) of shoulder elevation was implemented to induce delayed onset muscle
  soreness (DOMS) in the trapezius muscle. Identical experimental blocks were performed
  immediately and 24 h after ECC. Local tissue saturation index (TSI) was continuously
  recorded over upper trapezius throughout the experiment. TSI parameters such as
  mean TSI at rest, during computer work as well as TSI drop, recovery and their descending
  and ascending slopes were computed following the MVCs. TSI drop and recovery and
  their corresponding descending and ascending slopes were reduced immediately after
  ECC (p < 0.05). The computer work caused an increase in TSI at rest prior to the
  MVCs (p < 0.05) and elevated oxygen consumption (p < 0.05). The observed changes
  in oxygenation kinetics seemed to appear after a strenuous exercise and they do
  not seem to be affected by the presence of DOMS. However, computer work as a model
  of low load repetitive task caused increased oxygen consumption in a following bout
  of muscle contraction.
