abstract: 'The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in prefrontal cerebral oxygenation
  and microvascular blood volume during exercise in normobaric hypoxia and to investigate
  possible associations with the occurrence of acute mountain sickness (AMS) at altitude.
  Twenty-two healthy individuals (age, 26 ± 4 years; peak oxygen uptake, 42 ± 4 ml
  kg−1 min−1) were tested in two different conditions: normoxia (NORM) and normobaric
  hypoxia (fraction of inspired O2 = 0.13; HYPO). Data were collected at rest and
  during submaximal constant-speed exercise. The peripheral oxyhaemoglobin saturation
  was measured by finger pulse oximeter. Changes in prefrontal cerebral oxygenation
  (ΔHbO2), deoxygenation (ΔHHb) and microvascular blood volume (ΔHbtot) were obtained
  by near-infrared spectroscopy. Within 2 weeks after laboratory testing, subjects
  rapidly ascended to 3647 m a.s.l., and AMS was evaluated using the Lake Louise scale.
  Eight subjects were AMS+, whereas 14 were AMS−. During NORM, near-infrared spectroscopy
  variables did not change from baseline values both at rest and during exercise,
  with similar results in AMS+ and AMS− subjects. During HYPO, ΔHHb increased to a
  similar extent in both groups, both at rest and during exercise. The ΔHbO2 was significantly
  less in AMS+ compared with AMS− subjects, both at rest [−3.23 ± 5.90 versus 1.44
  ± 2.14 μm, P = 0.04, effect size (ES) = 1.1, respectively] and during exercise (−6.56
  ± 5.51 versus 0.37 ± 4.36 μm, P textless 0.01, ES = 1.2, respectively). Total haemoglobin
  did not change from baseline, both at rest (−1.67 ± 9.53 μm) and during exercise
  (−0.96 ± 9.12 μm) in AMS+ subjects, which was significantly different from the AMS−
  group (5.49 ± 3.99 μm, P = 0.03, ES = 1.0 and 8.17 ± 7.34 μm, P = 0.02, ES = 1.0,
  respectively). Individuals prone to AMS seem to be unable to increase microvascular
  blood volume and to maintain oxygenation at the cerebral level during exercise in
  acute normobaric hypoxia, suggesting that these changes might underpin later development
  of AMS.'
