abstract: 'Characterization of cortical activation patterns during movements in healthy
  adults may help our understanding of how the injured brain works. Upper limb motor
  tasks are commonly used to assess impaired motor function and to predict recovery
  in individuals with neurological disorders such as stroke. This study aimed to explore
  cortical activation patterns associated with movements of the hand and shoulder
  using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and to demonstrate the potential
  of this technology to distinguish cerebral activation between distal and proximal
  movements. Twenty healthy, right-handed participants were recruited. Two 10-s motor
  tasks (right-hand opening-closing and right shoulder abduction-adduction) were performed
  in a sitting position at a rate of 0.5 Hz in a block paradigm. We measured the variations
  in oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) and deoxyhemoglobin (HbR) concentrations. fNIRS was performed
  with a 24-channel system (Brite 24®; Artinis) that covered most motor control brain
  regions bilaterally. Activation was mostly contralateral for both hand and shoulder
  movements. Activation was more lateral for hand movements and more medial for shoulder
  movements, as predicted by the classical homunculus representation. Both HbO2 and
  HbR concentrations varied with the activity. Our results showed that fNIRS can distinguish
  patterns of cortical activity in upper limb movements under ecological conditions.
  These results suggest that fNIRS can be used to measure spontaneous motor recovery
  and rehabilitation-induced recovery after brain injury. The trial was restropectively
  registered on January 20, 2023: NCT05691777 (clinicaltrial.gov).'
