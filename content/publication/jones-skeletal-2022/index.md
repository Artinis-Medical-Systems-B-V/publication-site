abstract: 'Measuring local haemodynamics in skeletal muscle has the potential to provide
  valuable insight into the oxygen delivery to tissue, especially during high demand
  situations such as exercise. The aim of this study was to compare the skeletal muscle
  microvascular response during post-occlusive reactive hyperaemia (PORH) with the
  response to exercise, each measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and
  to establish if associations exist between muscle measures and exercise capacity
  or sex. Participants were from a population-based cohort study, the Southall and
  Brent Revisited (SABRE) study. Skeletal muscle measures included changes in tissue
  saturation index at the onset of exercise (∆TSI BL-INC ) and across the whole of
  exercise (∆TSI BL-EE ), time to 50%, 95% and 100% PORH, rate of PORH recovery, area
  under the curve (AUC) and total oxygenated Haemoglobin (oxy-Hb) change during PORH.
  Exercise capacity was measured using a 6-min stepper test (6MST). Analysis was by
  multiple linear regression. In total, 558 participants completed the 6MST with NIRS
  measures of TSI (mean age±SD: 73 ± 7years, 59% male). A sub-set of 149 participants
  also undertook the arterial occlusion. Time to 100% PORH, recovery rate, AUC and
  ∆oxy-Hb were all associated with ∆TSI BL-EE (β-coefficient (95%CI): 0.05 (0.01,
  0.09), p = 0.012; −47 (-85, −9.9), p = 0.014; 1.7 (0.62, 2.8), p = 0.002; 0.04 (0.002.0.108),
  p = 0.041, respectively). Time to 95% &amp; 100% PORH, AUC and ∆oxy-Hb were all
  associated with ∆TSI BL-INC (β-coefficient (95%CI): −0.07 (−0.12,−0.02), p = 0.02;
  −0.03 (−0.05, −0.003), p = 0.028; 0.85 (0.18, 1.5), p = 0.013 &amp; 0.05 (0.02,
  0.09), p = 0.001, respectively). AUC and ∆Oxy-Hb were associated with steps achieved
  (β-coefficient (95%CI): 18.0 (2.3, 33.7), p = 0.025; 0.86 (0.10, 1.6), p = 0.027).
  ∆TSI BL-EE was associated with steps and highest VO 2 (1.7 (0.49, 2.9), p = 0.006;
  7.7 (3.2, 12.3), p = 0.001). ∆TSI BL-INC was associated with steps and VO 2 but
  this difference was attenuated towards the null after adjustment for age, sex and
  ethnicity. ∆TSI BL-EE was greater in women (3.4 (0.4, 8.9) versus 2.1 (0.3, 7.4),
  p = 0.017) and ∆TSI BL-INC was lower in women versus men (2.4 (0.2, 10.2) versus
  3.2 (0.2, 18.2), p = 0.016). These Local microvascular NIRS-measures are associated
  with exercise capacity in older adults and several measures can detect differences
  in microvascular reactivity between a community-based sample of men and women.'
