abstract: Five patients with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) and
  27 healthy controls were examined by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for the noninvasive
  and direct quantitative measurement of muscle oxygen consumption and forearm blood
  flow. NIRS measurements were obtained in rest and during static isometric handgrip
  exercise at 10% of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) force. A significantly
  decreased oxygen consumption at rest as well as during exercise was found in patients
  with CPEO. Our results suggest that NIRS is able to discriminate between CPEO patients
  and healthy controls, which makes NIRS a valuable tool in the diagnostic workup
  of patients suspected to have a mitochondrial myopathy.
