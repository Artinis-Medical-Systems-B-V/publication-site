 abstract = {Five patients with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) and 27 healthy controls were examined by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for the noninvasive and direct quantitative measurement of muscle oxygen consumption and forearm blood flow. NIRS measurements were obtained in rest and during static isometric handgrip exercise at 10% of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) force. A significantly decreased oxygen consumption at rest as well as during exercise was found in patients with CPEO. Our results suggest that NIRS is able to discriminate between CPEO patients and healthy controls, which makes NIRS a valuable tool in the diagnostic workup of patients suspected to have a mitochondrial myopathy.},
