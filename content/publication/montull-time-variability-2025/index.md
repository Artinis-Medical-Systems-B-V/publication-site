abstract: The time-variability of physiological and kinematic variables, extracted
  at mesoscopic and macroscopic levels, respectively, has shown potential in detecting
  changes in exercise workload and associated fatigue effects. However, the sensitivity
  of microscopic variables —such as muscle oxygen saturation, which reflect the dynamics
  of muscle metabolism—remains unexplored. This study aimed to compare the time-variability
  structure of the tissular saturation index (TSI) during a graded maximal exercise
  performed until exhaustion. Nineteen participants started running at 8 km/h with
  the speed increasing by 1 km/h every 100 s until they could not keep the prescribed
  velocity. The time-variability of TSI, recorded from the quadriceps, was analyzed
  using Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and Sample entropy (SampEn) over the
  first and last 2048 recorded data points (corresponding to 204 s each). Wilcoxon
  test and Cohen’s d were used to compare the initial and final parts of the test.
  Results revealed a significant decrease in the Hurst (H) exponent (from H = 0.84 ± 0.21
  to H = 0.49 ± 0.10; p textless 0.01; d = -1.57) and a corresponding increase in
  SampEn (from 1.12 ± 0.20 to 1.40 ± 0.13; p textless 0.01; d = 1.17). These findings
  indicate a shift towards uncorrelated white-noise as exhaustion approached, suggesting
  reduced efficacy of oxygen transportation with increasing workloads. The time-variability
  of muscle oxygen saturation appears to be a) a promising measure for assessing exercise
  intensity, and b) allow the study of physiological network interactions extracted
  from different levels (from microscopic to macroscopic).
