abstract: "Vasovagal syncope is usually described as a sudden and transient loss of\
  \ consciousness that resolves spontaneously. Cardiocirculatory changes are well\
  \ described during and before syncope. However, changes in the cerebral oxygenation\
  \ are not well defined. In this study, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used\
  \ to assess the cerebral oxygenation directly during 80\xB0head-up (HU) tilt. To\
  \ simulate central hypovolaemia, 500 ml of blood was drawn from each of 10 healthy\
  \ subjects. Oxygenation index (OI) was defined as the difference between oxy- and\
  \ deoxyhaemoglobin concentration. Blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac output\
  \ were monitored using a finger plethysmographic device. The protocol was divided\
  \ into two stages, each consisting of a 15-min stabilization period in the supine\
  \ (SUP) position, 15 min in HU position and another 10 min in SUP position, Between\
  \ both stages, blood was drawn from the subject. Haemoglobin concentration and haematocrit\
  \ were measured before and 30 min after withdrawal of blood. No compensatory haemodilution\
  \ was observed. During HU position in the second stage, six subjects showed signs\
  \ of presyncope (F) and four did not (NF). A significant difference between F and\
  \ NF was found in the observation that, before fainting, the OI of F showed a steady\
  \ and significant (P = 0.02) decrease (-1.4 \xB1 0.5 $\u03BC$M min-1) compared with\
  \ NF (-0.18 \xB1 0.16 $\u03BC$M min-1). This indicates that the onset of (pre)syncope\
  \ is preceded by a mismatch between oxygen demand and oxygen supply in the cerebrum.\
  \ Using NIRS enabled us to monitor this mismatch and to predict the onset of a syncope\
  \ before clear signs in cardiocirculatory variables were visible."
