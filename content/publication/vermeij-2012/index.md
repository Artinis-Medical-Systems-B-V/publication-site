abstract: "Working memory is sensitive to aging-related decline. Evidence exists that\
  \ aging is accompanied by a reorganization of the working-memory circuitry, but\
  \ the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we examined\
  \ aging-related changes in prefrontal activation during working-memory performance\
  \ using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), a noninvasive neuroimaging\
  \ technique. Seventeen healthy young (21-32 years) and 17 healthy older adults (64-81\
  \ years) performed a verbal working-memory task (n-back). Oxygenated and deoxygenated\
  \ hemoglobin concentration changes were registered by two fNIRS channels located\
  \ over the left and right prefrontal cortex. Increased working-memory load resulted\
  \ in worse performance compared to the control condition in older adults, but not\
  \ in young participants. In both young and older adults, prefrontal activation increased\
  \ with rising working-memory load. Young adults showed slight right-hemispheric\
  \ dominance at low levels of working-memory load, while no hemispheric differences\
  \ were apparent in older adults. Analysis of the time-activation curve during the\
  \ high working-memory load condition revealed a continuous increase of the hemodynamic\
  \ response in the young. In contrast to that, a quadratic pattern of activation\
  \ was found in the older participants. Based on these results it could be hypothesized\
  \ that young adults were better able to keep the prefrontal cortex recruited over\
  \ a prolonged period of time. To conclude, already at low levels of working-memory\
  \ load do older adults recruit both hemispheres, possibly in an attempt to compensate\
  \ for the observed aging-related decline in performance. Also, our study shows that\
  \ aging effects on the time course of the hemodynamic response must be taken into\
  \ account in the interpretation of the results of neuroimaging studies that rely\
  \ on blood oxygen levels, such as fMRI. \xA9 2012 Vermeij et al."
