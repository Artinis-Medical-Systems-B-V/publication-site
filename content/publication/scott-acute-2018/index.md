abstract: "This study assessed whether hypoxia during high-load resistance exercise\
  \ could enhance the acute physiological responses related to muscular development.\
  \ Twelve trained men performed exercise in three conditions: normoxia (fraction\
  \ of inspired oxygen [FIO2]\_=\_21%), moderate-level hypoxia (FIO2\_=\_16%) and\
  \ high-level hypoxia (FIO2\_=\_13%). Exercise comprised high-load squats and deadlifts\
  \ (5\_\xD7\_5 using 80% of 1-repetition maximum with 180-s rest). Muscle oxygenation\
  \ and activation were monitored during exercise. Metabolic stress was estimated\
  \ via capillary blood sampling. Perceived fatigue and soreness were also quantified\
  \ following exercise. While the hypoxic conditions appeared to affect muscle oxygenation,\
  \ significant differences between conditions were only noted for maximal deoxyhaemoglobin\
  \ in the deadlift (P\_=\_0\u02D9009). Blood lactate concentration increased from\
  \ 1\u02D91 to 1\u02D92\_mmol\_l\u22121 at baseline to 9\u02D95\u20139\u02D98\_mmol\_\
  l\u22121 after squats and 10\u02D94\u201310\u02D95\_mmol\_l\u22121 after deadlifts\
  \ (P\u22640\u02D9001), although there were no between-condition differences. Perceived\
  \ fatigue and muscle soreness were significantly elevated immediately and at 24\_\
  h following exercise, respectively, by similar magnitudes in all conditions (P\u2264\
  0\u02D9001). Muscle activation did not differ between conditions. While metabolic\
  \ stress is thought to moderate muscle activation and subsequent muscular development\
  \ during hypoxic resistance training, it is not augmented during traditional high-load\
  \ exercise. This may be explained by the low number of repetitions performed and\
  \ the long interset rest periods employed during this training. These findings suggest\
  \ that high-load resistance training might not benefit from additional hypoxia as\
  \ has been shown for low- and moderate-load training."
