abstract: "After an active muscle stretch, maintaining a certain amount of force in\
  \ the following isometric phase is accompanied by less muscle activation compared\
  \ to an isometric contraction without preceding active stretch at the corresponding\
  \ muscle length. This reduced muscle activation might be related to reduced metabolic\
  \ costs, such as the oxidative metabolism. Hence, the aim of this study was to clarify\
  \ if mechanisms associated with stretch-induced activation reduction (AR) also influence\
  \ oxygen consumption of voluntary activated human muscles after active stretch.\
  \ Plantarflexion torque of 20 subjects was measured during 1) purely isometric and\
  \ 2) active stretch contractions (26\xB0, 60\xB0/s), at a submaximal torque level\
  \ of 30% MVC. Oxygen consumption (m VO2) of gastrocnemius medialis (GM) was estimated\
  \ by near-infrared spectroscopy while applying arterial occlusion. Since the overall\
  \ group did not show AR at GM after active stretch (p > 0.19), a subgroup was defined\
  \ (n = 10) showing AR of 13.0 \xB1 10.3% (p = 0.00). However, for both purely isometric\
  \ and active contractions m VO2 was the same (p = 0.32). Therefore, AR triggered\
  \ by active stretch did not affect m VO2 of active human muscle."
