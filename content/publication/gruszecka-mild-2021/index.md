abstract: 'Abstract  Background  The aim of the study was to investigate the effect
  of mild cerebral hypoxia on haemoglobin oxygenation (HbO 2 ), cerebrospinal fluid
  dynamics and cardiovascular physiology. To achieve this goal, four signals were
  recorded simultaneously: blood pressure, heart rate / electrocardiogram, HbO 2 from
  right hemisphere and changes of subarachnoid space (SAS) width from left hemisphere.
  Signals were registered from 30 healthy, young participants (2 females and 28 males,
  body mass index = 24.5 ± 2.3 kg/m 2 , age 30.8 ± 13.4 years).    Results  We analysed
  the recorded signals using wavelet transform and phase coherence. We demonstrated
  for the first time that in healthy subjects exposed to mild poikilokapnic hypoxia
  there were increases in very low frequency HbO 2 oscillations (textless 0.052 Hz)
  in prefrontal cortex. Additionally, SAS fluctuation diminished in the whole frequency
  range which could be explained by brain oedema.    Conclusions  Consequently the
  study provides insight into mechanisms governing brain response to a mild hypoxic
  challenge. Our study supports the notion that HbO 2 and SAS width monitoring might
  be beneficial for patients with acute lung disease.'
