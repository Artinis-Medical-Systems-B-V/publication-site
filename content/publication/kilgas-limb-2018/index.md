abstract: "Introduction: Exercise with blood flow restriction (BFR) is emerging as\
  \ an effective modality for improving muscular function in clinical and athletic\
  \ populations. Selection of cuff pressure is critical because it should maximize\
  \ metabolic stress without completely occluding blood flow or compromising user\
  \ safety. It is unknown how cuff pressures determined at rest influence blood flow\
  \ hemodynamics during exercise. Purpose: We evaluated changes in blood flow and\
  \ tissue perfusion before, during, and after exercise with BFR. Methods: Ten males\
  \ performed rhythmic handgrip exercise (30 contractions, 30% MVC) at 0%, 60%, 80%,\
  \ 100%, and 120% of limb occlusion pressure (LOP). Brachial artery blood flow and\
  \ tissue saturation were assessed using Doppler ultrasound and near-infrared spectroscopy,\
  \ respectively. Results: At rest blood flow generally decreased with increased pressure\
  \ (0%\_>\_60%\_\u2248\_80%\_>\_100%\_\u2248\_120% LOP). During 60% and 80% LOP conditions,\
  \ blood flow increased during exercise from rest and decreased after exercise (all\
  \ P < 0.05). Compared to 0% LOP, relative blood flow at 60% and 80% LOP decreased\
  \ by 22\u201347% at rest, 22\u201348% during exercise, and 52\u201371% after exercise\
  \ (all P < 0.05). Increased LOP decreased tissue saturation during exercise with\
  \ BFR (P < 0.05). Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and cardiac output did not\
  \ differ across LOP. Conclusion: At pressures below LOP the cardiovascular system\
  \ overcame the external pressure and increased blood flow to exercising muscles.\
  \ Relative reductions in blood flow at rest were similar to those during exercise.\
  \ Thus, the relative occlusion measured at rest approximated the degree of occlusion\
  \ during exercise. Moderate cuff pressures increased metabolic stress without completely\
  \ occluding blood flow."
