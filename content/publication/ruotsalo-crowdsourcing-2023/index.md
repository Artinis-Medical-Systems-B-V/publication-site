abstract: Affective annotation refers to the process of labeling media content based
  on the emotions they evoke. Since such experiences are inherently subjective and
  depend on individual differences, the central challenge is associating digital content
  with its affective, interindividual experience. Here, we present a first-of-its-kind
  methodology for affective annotation directly from brain signals by monitoring the
  affective experience of a crowd of individuals via functional near-infrared spectroscopy
  (fNIRS). An experiment is reported in which fNIRS was recorded from 31 participants
  to develop a brain-computer interface (BCI) for affective annotation. Brain signals
  evoked by images were used to draw predictions about the affective dimensions that
  characterize the stimuli. By combining annotations, the results show that monitoring
  crowd responses can draw accurate affective annotations, with performance improving
  significantly with increases in crowd size. Our methodology demonstrates a proof-of-concept
  to source affective annotations from a crowd of BCI users without requiring any
  auxiliary mental or physical interaction.
