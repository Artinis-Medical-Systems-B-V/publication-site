abstract: 'Background: The ability to hang for a long time before forearm muscle fatigue
  is a crucial element of successful rock climbing. Electromyography (EMG) and near-infrared
  spectroscopy (NIRS) are also useful for measuring hemoglobin oxygenation for determining
  muscle endurance. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the reliability and
  validity of muscle endurance indices derived using EMG and NIRS during a hanging
  task. Methods: A bilateral hanging task was designed to compare rock climbers and
  non-climbers in terms of the slopes of changes in the median frequency (MDF) and
  tissue oxygenation index (TOI) of forearm muscles. Results: A total of 17 participants
  were included in each of the two groups. The intraclass correlation coefficient
  (3,1) values derived for the MDF slope, TOI slope, ΔTOI, percentage change in oxygen
  concentration, and ΔHbt were 0.85, 0.73, 0.65, 0.75, and 0.65, respectively. The
  MDF slope, TOI slope, and ΔHbt differed significantly between the groups (p textless
  0.05). The MDF slope, TOI slopes, and ΔHbt were significantly correlated with V-scale
  levels for climbing (p textless 0.05). Conclusions: The satisfactory reliability
  and observed distinctions between climbers and non-climbers imply that these indices
  are a valuable tool for assessing muscle endurance.'
