abstract: "The aim of the study was to compare simultaneously recorded a NIR-T/BSS\
  \ and NIRS signals from healthy volunteers. NIR-T/BSS is a device which give an\
  \ ability to non-invasively detect and monitor changes in the subarachnoid space\
  \ width (SAS). Experiments were performed on a group of 30 healthy volunteers (28\
  \ males and 2 females, age 30.8 \xB1 13.4\_years, BMI = 24.5 \xB1 2.3\_kg/m2). We\
  \ analysed recorded signals using analysis methods based on wavelet transform (WT)\
  \ for the wide frequency range from 0.0095 to 2\_Hz. Despite the fact that both\
  \ devices use a similar radiation source both signals are distinct from each other.\
  \ We found statistically significant differences for WT amplitude spectra between\
  \ both signals. Additionally, we showed different relationships of both signals\
  \ to blood pressure. Collectively, based on the present findings and those of previous\
  \ studies, we can conclude that the combination of NIR-T/BSS or NIRS signals and\
  \ time\u2013frequency analysis opens new frontiers in science, and give possibility\
  \ to understand and diagnosis of various neurodegenerative and ageing related diseases\
  \ to improve diagnostic procedures and patient prognosis."
