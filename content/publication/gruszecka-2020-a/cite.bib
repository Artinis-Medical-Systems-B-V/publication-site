 abstract = {The aim of the study was to compare simultaneously recorded a NIR-T/BSS and NIRS signals from healthy volunteers. NIR-T/BSS is a device which give an ability to non-invasively detect and monitor changes in the subarachnoid space width (SAS). Experiments were performed on a group of 30 healthy volunteers (28 males and 2 females, age 30.8 ± 13.4 years, BMI = 24.5 ± 2.3 kg/m2). We analysed recorded signals using analysis methods based on wavelet transform (WT) for the wide frequency range from 0.0095 to 2 Hz. Despite the fact that both devices use a similar radiation source both signals are distinct from each other. We found statistically significant differences for WT amplitude spectra between both signals. Additionally, we showed different relationships of both signals to blood pressure. Collectively, based on the present findings and those of previous studies, we can conclude that the combination of NIR-T/BSS or NIRS signals and time–frequency analysis opens new frontiers in science, and give possibility to understand and diagnosis of various neurodegenerative and ageing related diseases to improve diagnostic procedures and patient prognosis.},
