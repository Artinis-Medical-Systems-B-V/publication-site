abstract: "This study aimed to evaluate the effects of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF)\
  \ and mean arterial pressure (MAP) on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) oxygenation and\
  \ dual-task performance in healthy young males. Changes in the concentration of\
  \ oxygenated ($\u0394$HbO2) and deoxygenated hemoglobin ($\u0394$HHb) in the right\
  \ and left PFC were examined during a cognitive auditory 2-back task. Cognitive\
  \ performance (2-back task's accuracy) and walking motor performances were measured\
  \ in single-tasks (single motor and single cognitive) and dual-task (2-back task\
  \ + walking). Thirty-six young males were ranked according to their V\u02D9O2 peak.\
  \ The second tertile was excluded to generate two groups of different CRF (high\
  \ fit group: n = 12 and V\u02D9O2 peak = 56.0 \xB1 6.7 ml kg\u22121 min\u22121;\
  \ low-fit group: n = 12 and V\u02D9O2 peak = 36.7 \xB1 4.1 ml kg\u22121 min\u2212\
  1). The CRF groups were further split into two subgroups according to 24-h MAP (higher-MAP,\
  \ lower-MAP). Two-way ANOVA (CRF x n-back conditions) revealed a significant interaction\
  \ between the CRF and cognitive task condition on 2-back accuracy (p = .007) and\
  \ a main effect of CRF on \u2297HHb in the right and left PFC (p < .05). These results\
  \ suggest that in healthy young males: 1) for CRF, only low-fit individuals demonstrate\
  \ dual-task costs in accuracy (Dual < Single), and 2) that in comparison to the\
  \ low-fit group, the high fit-group demonstrated greater changes in PFC oxygenation\
  \ in $\u0394$HHb, but not $\u0394$HbO2."
