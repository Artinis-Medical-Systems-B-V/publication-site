abstract: Teacher-related factors significantly impact students’ higher-order thinking.
  However, the mechanisms of how these factors specifically affect students’ higher-order
  thinking in urban science classrooms are unclear, especially in the absence of empirical
  research based on multimodal assessment methodologies. This study explored the pathways
  of these factors by constructing a structural equation model and implemented a functional
  near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) experiment in an urban science classroom to collect
  brain data, exploring the mechanisms of students’ higher-order thinking development.
  The results indicated that both teacher-student relationships and scaffolding instruction
  could positively influence students’ higher-order thinking, and teacher-student
  relationships could promote students’ higher-order thinking through the chained
  mediating role of teacher guidance and scaffolding instruction, while teacher guidance
  alone had a significant negative effect on students’ higher-order thinking. Furthermore,
  students’ higher-order thinking during the science class using the scaffolding strategy
  was related to the increased interpersonal neural synchronization (INS) in the teacher
  and students’ dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)—a neural basis associated with
  effective teacher-student interaction. These findings confirm the importance of
  the teachers’ role during students’ higher-order thinking development and provide
  evidence from both the structural equation modeling and brain science for the mechanisms
  behind higher-order thinking development.
