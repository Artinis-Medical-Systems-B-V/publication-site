abstract: "International Journal of Exercise Science 13(3): 964-978, 2020. This study\
  \ was designed to compare systemic O2 utilization (V\u022E2), and changes in tissue\
  \ O2 extraction [deoxyhemoglobin ($\u0394$HHb)] in the vastus lateralis (VL), gastrocnemius\
  \ (GAST) and pre-frontal cortex (PFC) tissue; between aerobically short-term trained\
  \ (STT) and long-term trained (LTT) older men (40-60 yr) who were matched for current\
  \ training load. On separate occasions, 14 STT and 14 LTT participants completed\
  \ ramp incremental (RI) and square-wave constant load (SWCL) tests on a cycle ergometer.\
  \ In LTT compared to STT; (i) V\u022E2 was higher during the RI (p > 0.001) and\
  \ SWCL (p >0.001) tests, (ii) $\u0394$HHb in the GAST was greater in SWCL (p = 0.011);\
  \ and (iii) $\u0394$HHb in the PFC was greater at 90% GET during SWCL (p = 0.011).\
  \ The additional years of training in LTT compared to STT (LTT 17.50yr \xB1 6.94yr\
  \ vs STT 1.68yr \xB1 0.31yr) were associated with higher V\u022E2peak, and sub-GET\
  \ V\u022E2, and $\u0394$HHb in the GAST and PFC at sub-GET exercise, despite there\
  \ being no difference in current training volume."
