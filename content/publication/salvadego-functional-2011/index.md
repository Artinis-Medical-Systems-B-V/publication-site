abstract: "A functional evaluation of skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism during\
  \ dynamic knee extension (KE) incremental exercises was carried out following a\
  \ 35-day bed rest (BR) (Valdoltra 2008 BR campaign). Nine young male volunteers\
  \ (age: 23.5 \xB1 2.2 yr; mean \xB1 SD) were evaluated. Pulmonary gas exchange,\
  \ heart rate and cardiac output (by impedance cardiography), skeletal muscle (vastus\
  \ lateralis) fractional O 2 extraction, and brain (frontal cortex) oxygenation (by\
  \ near-infrared spectroscopy) were determined during incremental KE. Values at exhaustion\
  \ were considered \"peak\". Peak heart rate (147 \xB1 18 beats/min before vs. 146\
  \ \xB1 17 beats/min after BR) and peak cardiac output (17.8 \xB1 3.3 l/min before\
  \ vs. 16.1 \xB1 1.8 l/min after BR) were unaffected by BR. As expected, brain oxygenation\
  \ did not decrease during KE. Peak O 2 uptake was lower after vs. before BR, both\
  \ when expressed as liters per minute (0.99 \xB1 0.17 vs. 1.26 \xB1 0.27) and when\
  \ normalized per unit of quadriceps muscle mass (46.5 \xB1 6.4 vs. 56.9 \xB1 11.0\
  \ ml\u02D9min\xB11\u02D9100 g -1). Skeletal muscle peak fractional O 2 extraction,\
  \ expressed as a percentage of the maximal values obtained during a transient limb\
  \ ischemia, was lower after (46.3 \xB1 12.1%) vs. before BR (66.5 \xB1 11.2%). After\
  \ elimination, by the adopted exercise protocol, of constraints related to cardiovascular\
  \ O 2 delivery, a decrease in peak O 2 uptake and muscle peak capacity of fractional\
  \ O 2 extraction was found after 35 days of BR. These findings suggest a substantial\
  \ impairment of oxidative function at the muscle level, \"downstream\" with respect\
  \ to bulk blood flow to the exercising muscles, that is possibly at the level of\
  \ blood flow distribution/O 2 utilization inside the muscle, peripheral O 2 diffusion,\
  \ and intracellular oxidative metabolism. Copyright \xA9 2011 the American Physiological\
