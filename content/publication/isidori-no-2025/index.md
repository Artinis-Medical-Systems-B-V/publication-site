abstract: 'Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) is a potential ergogenic technique but the
  response rates vary considerably in the literature. The use of markedly different
  IPC protocols among the published literature, including pressure, rounds of ischemia,
  and time latencies potentially contribute to heterogenous responses. This study
  investigated whether the duration of time between the application of IPC and the
  commencement of exercise may explain equivocal ergogenic results. Fourteen (n = 11
  male, n = 3 female) moderately trained volunteers participated in a familiarization
  and three experimental trials: no IPC (CON), IPC-5 (4 × 5 min IPC applied 5 min
  before exercise), and IPC-30 (4 × 5 min IPC applied 30 min before exercise). Participants
  completed maximal 10-min accumulated work (kJ) cycling time trials. Oxygen uptake
  ( . V ⁢O2), heart rate, vastus lateralis tissue oxygenation, and blood lactate concentrations
  ([La–]b) were measured before, during, and after exercise. There were no differences
  in performance or physiological responses during or after exercise among CON, IPC-5,
  and IPC-30. These findings add further evidence to the existing literature reporting
  that IPC-related ergogenicity is equivocal when administered 5 or 30 min before
  exercise. These results reinforce the requirement to clarify whether there exists
  an IPC protocol that reliably elicits an ergogenic effect.'
