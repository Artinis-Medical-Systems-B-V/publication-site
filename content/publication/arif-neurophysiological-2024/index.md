abstract: Human–robot collaboration (HRC) has become increasingly prevalent due to
  innovative advancements in the automation industry, especially in manufacturing
  setups. Although HRC increases productivity and efficacy, it exposes human workers
  to psychological stress while interfacing with collaborative robotic systems as
  robots may not provide visual or auditory cues. It is crucial to comprehend how
  HRC impacts mental stress in order to enhance occupational safety and well-being.
  Though academics and industrial interest in HRC is expanding, safety and mental
  stress problems are still not adequately studied. In particular, human coworkers’
  cognitive strain during HRC has not been explored well, although being fundamental
  to sustaining a secure and constructive workplace environment. This study, therefore,
  aims to monitor the mental stress of factory workers during HRC using behavioural,
  physiological and subjective measures. Physiological measures, being objective and
  more authentic, have the potential to replace conventional measures i.e., behavioural
  and subjective measures, if they demonstrate a good correlation with traditional
  measures. Two neuroimaging modalities including electroencephalography (EEG) and
  functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) have been used as physiological measures
  to track neuronal and hemodynamic activity of the brain, respectively. Here, the
  correlation between physiological data and behavioural and subjective measurements
  has been ascertained through the implementation of seven different machine learning
  algorithms. The results imply that the EEG and fNIRS features combined produced
  the best results for most of the targets. For subjective measures being the target,
  linear regression has outperformed all other models, whereas tree and ensemble performed
  the best for predicting the behavioural measures. The outcomes indicate that physiological
  measures have the potential to be more informative and often substitute other skewed
  metrics.
