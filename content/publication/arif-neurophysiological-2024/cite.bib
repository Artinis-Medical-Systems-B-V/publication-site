 abstract = {Human–robot collaboration (HRC) has become increasingly prevalent due to innovative advancements in the automation industry, especially in manufacturing setups. Although HRC increases productivity and efficacy, it exposes human workers to psychological stress while interfacing with collaborative robotic systems as robots may not provide visual or auditory cues. It is crucial to comprehend how HRC impacts mental stress in order to enhance occupational safety and well-being. Though academics and industrial interest in HRC is expanding, safety and mental stress problems are still not adequately studied. In particular, human coworkers’ cognitive strain during HRC has not been explored well, although being fundamental to sustaining a secure and constructive workplace environment. This study, therefore, aims to monitor the mental stress of factory workers during HRC using behavioural, physiological and subjective measures. Physiological measures, being objective and more authentic, have the potential to replace conventional measures i.e., behavioural and subjective measures, if they demonstrate a good correlation with traditional measures. Two neuroimaging modalities including electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) have been used as physiological measures to track neuronal and hemodynamic activity of the brain, respectively. Here, the correlation between physiological data and behavioural and subjective measurements has been ascertained through the implementation of seven different machine learning algorithms. The results imply that the EEG and fNIRS features combined produced the best results for most of the targets. For subjective measures being the target, linear regression has outperformed all other models, whereas tree and ensemble performed the best for predicting the behavioural measures. The outcomes indicate that physiological measures have the potential to be more informative and often substitute other skewed metrics.},
