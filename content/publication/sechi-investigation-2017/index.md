abstract: Exercise intolerance is one of the clinical hallmarks of late-onset Pompe
  disease (LOPD). We studied the acute effects of ERT on the physiological variables
  associated with exercise tolerance in patients chronically ERT treated. Moreover,
  we assessed the influence of clinical severity on the investigated variables. The
  day before (B) and the day after (A) ERT injection, 11 LOPD patients performed on
  a cycle-ergometer an exercise tolerance test to voluntary exhaustion; VO2, HR, RPE,
  and GAA activity were determined in B and A. The disease severity was characterized
  by Walton scale, 6MWT, and pulmonary function tests. No significant differences
  in the variables related to exercise tolerance were found in A vs B, despite a significant
  increase in GAA activity in peripheral lymphocytes. No differences in VO2 peak were
  observed between patients with only skeletal muscle impairment and patients with
  both skeletal and respiratory muscle impairment. Distance walked at 6MWT was significantly
  higher than VO2 peak expressed as percentage of normal values. In conclusion, in
  LOPD patients the exercise tolerance test is not acutely affected by ERT administration;
  the peripheral muscle component seems more prominent in determining the VO2 peak
  decrease than the respiratory component; VO2 peak might be more sensitive than 6MWT
  in estimating exercise tolerance in LOPD.
