abstract: Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a wearable optical spectroscopy
  system originally developed for continuous and non-invasive monitoring of brain
  function by measuring blood oxygen concentration. Recent advancements in brain–computer
  interfacing allow us to control the neuron function of the brain by combining it
  with fNIRS to regulate cognitive function. In this review manuscript, we provide
  information regarding current advancement in fNIRS and how it provides advantages
  in developing brain–computer interfacing to enable neuron function. We also briefly
  discuss about how we can use this technology for further applications.
