abstract: "OBJECTIVE This study examined test-retest relative (intraclass correlation\
  \ coefficient) and absolute (minimum detectable change) reliabilities for heart\
  \ rate, blood pressure, rate of perceived exertion, and the cerebral oxygen response\
  \ during both forward and backward treadmill walking in clients with Parkinson disease.\
  \ In addition, the intensity of exercise based on the individual's heart rate response\
  \ during forward and backward walking treadmill work was assessed. DESIGN Test-retest\
  \ reliability study. SUBJECTS A total of 22 clients with Parkinson disease (Hoehn\
  \ and Yahr stages 1-3). MAIN MEASURES Outcome measures of heart rate, blood pressure,\
  \ and cerebral oxygen response were assessed during forward and backward walking\
  \ on a treadmill for a total of 20\u2009minutes up to an intensity based on the\
  \ clients' prior treadmill work and their rate of perceived exertion. RESULTS Good\
  \ to excellent 6-8\u2009day test-retest findings for both forward (intraclass correlation\
  \ coefficient(2,1), 0.89-0.99) and backward (intraclass correlation coefficient(2,1),\
  \ 0.82-0.99) treadmill walking were found for heart rate, blood pressure, cerebral\
  \ oxygen response, and the participants' rate of perceived exertion. Low minimum\
  \ detectable change (MDC)95 values were found for heart rate (4.9 and 4.8), rate\
  \ of perceived exertion (1.0 and 1.6), and cerebral oxygen response (1.2 and 0.92),\
  \ during forward and backward walking, respectively. All treadmill exercise heart\
  \ rates attained by participants were within an intensity of 54%-87% of the client's\
  \ predicted maximal heart rate. CONCLUSION Treadmill exercise training can be included\
  \ in Parkinson disease exercise programs with relative confidence in test-retest\
  \ reliability of cardiovascular response. It was also demonstrated that individuals\
  \ with Parkinson disease previously involved with exercise consistently self-select\
  \ walking speeds which induce heart rates within recommended guidelines for positive\
  \ cardiovascular adaptation."
