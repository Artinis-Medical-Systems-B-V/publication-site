abstract: Postural control decrements with advancing age have been largely identified
  in the literature. Dual-task paradigms have been utilized to increase older adults'
  stability in order to direct the attention towards the completion of a secondary
  task, leaving the automatic motor control processes to modulate posture unconstrained.
  To the extent that older adults allocate greater attentional resources to maintain
  an upright posture, the present study aimed at replicating St-Amant et al. (2020)
  protocol to investigate automatic postural control and prefrontal cortex activation
  in older adults when simultaneously performing quiet standing wtih different attention-demanding
  cognitive tasks.  Nineteen healthy older adults (71.47 Â± 6.01 years) were recruited
  and self-reported no hearing, musculoskeletal and neurological problems. Older adults
  were required to perform three different cognitive loads while seated (SC), quietly
  standing on a force platform (SM), and performing both tasks simultaneously (DT).  Static
  center-of-pressure measurements and wavelet discrete transform did not reveal postural
  automaticity in dual-task conditions. Conversely, sample entropy values were significantly
  greater when performing n-back compared to all other tasks in the medial-lateral
  direction, and significantly greater than SM in the anterior-posterior direction.
  The relative concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) of the left hemisphere
  was significantly greater than the right when performing n-back, and significantly
  greater within the left hemisphere when performing n-back compared to double-number
  sequence.  Collectively, our results do not support the presence of automatic postural
  control in dual-task conditions for older adults. The present study highlights the
  importance of using numerous variables when investigating posture in order to capture
  its complexity.
