abstract: The functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) technology is an optical
  imaging technology that applies near-infrared light to measure the oxygenated and
  deoxygenated hemoglobin concentration alteration in cortical brain structures. It
  has the ability to directly measure changes in the blood oxygen level of the high
  temporal resolution associated with neural activation. Thus, it has been utilized
  in different neurological diseases, such as epilepsy, stroke, and Parkinson. The
  work of this paper will focus on the application of the fNIRS in the three neurological
  diseases and the principle of fNIRS. Moreover, the difficulties and challenges that
  the technology is currently experiencing have been discussed.
