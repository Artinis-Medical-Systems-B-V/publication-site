abstract: "Vibration training is commonly expected to induce an active muscle contraction\
  \ via a complex reflex mechanism. In calf muscles of 20 untrained subjects, the\
  \ additional energy consumption in response to vibration superimposed on an isometric\
  \ contraction was examined by 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy and by near infrared\
  \ spectroscopy. Subjects performed 3 min of isometric plantar flexion exercise at\
  \ 40% MVC under four conditions: with (VIB) and without (CON) superimposed 20 Hz\
  \ vibration at \xB12 mm amplitude, both combined with or without arterial occlusion\
  \ (AO). After contraction under all conditions, the decreases in oxygenated haemoglobin\
  \ were not significantly different. After VIB + AO consumption of ATP was increased\
  \ by 60% over CON + AO, visible by significant decreases in [PCr] and intracellular\
  \ pH (P < 0.05). The additional energy consumption by vibration was not detectable\
  \ under natural perfusion. Probably without AO the additional energy consumption\
  \ by vibration was compensated by oxidative phosphorylation enabled by additional\
  \ perfusion. \xA9 Springer-Verlag 2008."
