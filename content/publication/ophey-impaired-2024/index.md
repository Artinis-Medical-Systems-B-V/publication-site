abstract: 'Purpose: According to the homeostasis model, patellofemoral pain (PFP)
  arises as a consequence of disturbed homeostasis of anterior structures of the knee
  due to vascular insufficiency. Near‐infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) allows to measure
  changes of concentrations (µmol/cm2) of (de)‐oxygenated hemoglobine (HHb and O2Hb).
  The aim was to study differences in patellar hemodynamics between patients and healthy
  controls. Methods: Hemodynamics of patients (n= 30 [female = 20, age = 21.5, BMI = 22.9])
  and controls (n = 30 (female = 18, age = 21.4, BMI = 22.4]) were evaluated for two
  activities (‘Prolonged Sitting’ and ‘Stair Descent’). Blinding for health status
  was implemented. Results: During ‘Prolonged Sitting’, PFP patients exhibited smaller
  decreases in mean changes for HHb (PFP [M = −1.5 to −1.9], healthy controls [M = −2.0
  to −2.3]) and O2Hb (PFP [M = −2.0 to −3.2], healthy controls [M = −3.4 to −4.1]).
  However, these differences were statistically non‐significant (p = 0.14–0.82 and
  p = 0.056–0.18, respectively). Conversely, for ‘Stair Descent’, PFP patients showed
  statistically significant smaller decreases in mean changes for HHb (PFP [M = −1.9,
  SD = 1.8], healthy controls [M = −2.5, SD = 1.7], p = 0.043) and O2Hb (PFP [M = −3.2,
  SD = 3.2], healthy controls [M = −4.9, SD = 2.7], p = 0.004). Conclusions: The differences
  suggest potential impairment in patellar hemodynamics in PFP patients, providing
  support for the homeostasis model. Evidence‐based treatment strategies targeting
  patellar hemodynamics should be further refined and subjected to evaluation in clinical
  trials.'
