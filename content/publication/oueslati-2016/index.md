abstract: "We assessed respiratory muscles oxygenation responses during a ramp exercise\
  \ to exhaustion and further explored their relationship with the non-linear increase\
  \ of VO2 (VO2 excess) observed above the gas-exchange threshold. Ten male cyclists\
  \ completed a ramp exercise to exhaustion on an electromagnetically braked cycle-ergometer\
  \ with a rate of increment of 30 W min-1 with continuous monitoring of expired gases\
  \ (breath-by-breath) and oxygenation status of intercostal muscles. Maximal inspiratory\
  \ and expiratory pressure measurements were taken at rest and at exhaustion. The\
  \ VO2 excess represents the difference between VO2max observed and VO2max expected\
  \ using linear equation between the VO2 and the intensity before gas-exchange threshold.\
  \ The deoxyhemoglobin remained unchanged until 60% of maximal aerobic power (MAP)\
  \ and thereafter increased significantly by 37 \xB1 18% and 40 \xB1 22% at 80% and\
  \ 100% of MAP, respectively. Additionally, the amplitude of deoxyhemoglobin increase\
  \ between 60 and 100% of MAP positively correlated with the VO2 excess (r = 0.69,\
  \ p < 0.05). Compared to exercise start, the oxygen tissue saturation index decreased\
  \ from 80% of MAP (-4.8 \xB1 3.2%, p < 0.05) onwards. At exhaustion, maximal inspiratory\
  \ and expiratory pressures declined by 7.8 \xB1 16% and 12.6 \xB1 10% (both p <\
  \ 0.05), respectively. In summary, our results suggest a significant contribution\
  \ of respiratory muscles to the VO2 excess phenomenon."
