abstract: Abstract  Background Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a
  tool to assess brain activity during cognitive testing. Despite its usefulness,
  its feasibility in assessing mental workload remains unclear. This study was to
  investigate the potential use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on functional
  near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-derived signals to classify mental workload in
  individuals with mild cognitive impairment.   Methods  Spatial images by constructing
  a statistical activation map from the prefrontal activity of 120 subjects with MCI
  performing three difficulty levels of the N-back task (0, 1, and 2-back) were used
  for CNNs. The CNNs were evaluated using a 5 and 10 -fold cross-validation method.    Results  As
  the difficulty level of the N-back task increased, the accuracy decreased and prefrontal
  activity increased. In addition, there was a significant difference in the accuracy
  and prefrontal activity across the three levels ( p ’s textless 0.05). The accuracy
  of the CNNs based on fNIRS-derived spatial images evaluated by 5 and 10-fold cross-validation
  in classifying the difficulty levels ranged from 0.83 to 0.96.    Conclusion fNIRS
  could also be a promising tool for measuring mental workload in older adults with
  MCI despite their cognitive decline. In addition, this study demonstrated the feasibility
  of the classification performance of the CNNs based on fNIRS-derived signals from
  the prefrontal cortex.
