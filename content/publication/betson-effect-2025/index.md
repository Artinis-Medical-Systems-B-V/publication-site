abstract: In medical education, consistent and repetitive practice are crucial for
  mastering highly technical skills and clinical diagnosis. Hands-on experience and
  simulations play a vital role in developing these competencies. Objective structured
  clinical examinations (OSCEs) assess these skills, though they can induce stress,
  which may impact clinical performance both positively and negatively. This study,
  registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12623001214628),
  assessed psychophysiological responses and clinical decision-making skills of 26
  undergraduate paramedicine students completing two high-acuity simulated OSCE assessments.
  We found that when participants completed their second scenario seven days after
  their initial attempt, a significant decrease in cortisol concentration (p = 0.016),
  heart rate variability (p = 0.021), skin temperature (p = 0.045) and perspiration
  levels (p textless .001) were recorded. We also observed earlier neural activation
  suggesting participants were forming crucial clinical decisions and prioritising
  tasks more quickly in the second scenario. Importantly, clinical performance also
  improved significantly (p textless .001). Our findings support the inclusion of
  repeated high-acuity simulation practice in OSCE assessments to help students develop
  confidence, improve decision-making under stress, and ultimately enhance clinical
  outcomes.
