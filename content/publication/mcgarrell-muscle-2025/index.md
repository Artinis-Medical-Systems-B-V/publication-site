abstract: Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) results from a faulty mitochondrial protein known
  as Frataxin. The purpose of this case report was to test whether skeletal muscle
  in FRDA can adapt to an endurance-based training program using neuromuscular electrical
  stimulation (NMES). A 36-year-old female with FRDA completed twelve training sessions,
  each lasting 30 min over 30 days, focused on the forearm muscles using NMES. Pre-
  and post-training session measurements of contractions, muscle-specific endurance,
  and muscle mitochondrial capacity were taken per training session. Training contractions
  increased from 4200 to 9420. Muscle-specific endurance increased by 14% at 2 Hz
  and 17% at 4 Hz. Muscle endurance at 6 Hz increased from 0% to 51%. The rate constant
  of mitochondrial capacity was 0.95 min−1 pre- and 0.99 min−1 post-training session.
  In conclusion, one month of NMES increased training volume and muscle-specific endurance
  but did not change mitochondrial capacity. Muscle adaptations to endurance training
  were seen in FRDA, but increased training might be needed to test if mitochondrial
  capacity can improve.
