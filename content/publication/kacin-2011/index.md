abstract: "This study investigated the effects of frequent low-load ischemic resistance\
  \ exercise performed to failure on quadriceps size and performance, muscle activation,\
  \ oxygen kinetics and cardiovascular responses. Ten healthy males performed knee-extension\
  \ exercise for 4 weeks (4 sessions/week) at 15% maximal voluntary muscle contraction\
  \ (MVC). One leg was trained with free blood flow (C-leg) while in the other leg\
  \ (I-leg) ischemia was induced by an inflatable cuff (\u2265230mmHg). Quadriceps\
  \ cross-sectional area (CSA) of the I-leg increased by 3.4% (P<0.05). A tendency\
  \ for smaller increase in muscle CSAs at the cuff level was observed. MVC force\
  \ did not change in either leg, whereas the number of repetitions during exercise\
  \ test to failure increased (P<0.01) by 63% in I-leg and 36% in C-leg. The decrease\
  \ in muscle oxygenated hemoglobin concentration acquired by NIRS was attenuated\
  \ (P<0.01) by 56% in I-leg and 21% in C-leg. Electromyographic amplitude of rectus\
  \ femoris in I-leg was \u223C45% lower (P<0.025) during the ischemic test. Also,\
  \ \u223C9% increase (P<0.05) in pre-exercise diastolic pressure was observed. In\
  \ conclusion, substantial gains in muscle endurance capacity were induced, which\
  \ were associated with enhanced muscle oxygen delivery. The potential negative effects\
  \ of ischemic exercise with high cuff pressure on muscle and nerve and on arterial\
  \ pressure regulation need further investigation. \xA9 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S."
