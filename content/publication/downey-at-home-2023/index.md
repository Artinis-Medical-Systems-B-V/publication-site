abstract: 'Abstract  Background Hearing loss predicts cognitive decline and falls
  risk. It has been argued that degraded hearing makes listening effortful, causing
  competition for higher-level cognitive resources needed for secondary cognitive
  or motor tasks. Therefore, executive function training has the potential to improve
  cognitive performance, in turn improving mobility, especially when older adults
  with hearing loss are engaged in effortful listening. Moreover, research using mobile
  neuroimaging and ecologically valid measures of cognition and mobility in this population
  is limited. The objective of this research is to examine the effect of at-home cognitive
  training on dual-task performance using laboratory and simulated real-world conditions
  in normal-hearing adults and older hearing aid users. We hypothesize that executive
  function training will lead to greater improvements in cognitive-motor dual-task
  performance compared to a wait-list control group. We also hypothesize that executive
  function training will lead to the largest dual-task improvements in older hearing
  aid users, followed by normal-hearing older adults, and then middle-aged adults.   Methods
  A multi-site (Concordia University and KITE-Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, University
  Health Network) single-blinded randomized controlled trial will be conducted whereby
  participants are randomized to either 12 weeks of at-home computerized executive
  function training or a wait-list control. Participants will consist of normal-hearing
  middle-aged adults (45–60 years old) and older adults (65–80 years old), as well
  as older hearing aid users (65–80 years old, ≥ 6 months hearing aid experience).
  Separate samples will undergo the same training protocol and the same pre- and post-evaluations
  of cognition, hearing, and mobility across sites. The primary dual-task outcome
  measures will involve either static balance (KITE site) or treadmill walking (Concordia
  site) with a secondary auditory-cognitive task. Dual-task performance will be assessed
  in an immersive virtual reality environment in KITE’s StreetLab and brain activity
  will be measured using functional near infrared spectroscopy at Concordia’s PERFORM
  Centre.   Discussion This research will establish the efficacy of an at-home cognitive
  training program on complex auditory and motor functioning under laboratory and
  simulated real-world conditions. This will contribute to rehabilitation strategies
  in order to mitigate or prevent physical and cognitive decline in older adults with
  hearing loss.   Trial registration  Identifier: NCT05418998. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05418998'
