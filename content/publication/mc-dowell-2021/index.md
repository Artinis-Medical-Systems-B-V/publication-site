abstract: "Individuals with anxiety disorders exhibit lower intrinsic functional connectivity\
  \ between prefrontal cortical areas and subcortical regions. The prefrontal cortex\
  \ (PFC) is sensitive to the acute and chronic effects of physical activity (PA),\
  \ while the anxiolytic effects of PA are well known. The current study examined\
  \ the association of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), and its interaction with\
  \ PA, with resting-state left PFC oxygenation. This cross-sectional study used data\
  \ from participants (n=2444) from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, a nationally\
  \ representative prospective study of community-living adults aged \u226550 years\
  \ in Ireland. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview Short-Form determined\
  \ fulfilment of criteria for GAD. The short-form International Physical Activity\
  \ Questionnaire determined adherence to the World Health Organisation PA guidelines.\
  \ Resting-state, left PFC oxygenation was continuously measured via a Portalite.\
  \ Tissue saturation index (TSI) was calculated as the ratio of oxygenated haemoglobin\
  \ to total tissue haemoglobin (expressed as a percentage) for the final minute of\
  \ a five-minute supine-rest period. Multivariable lineae regression quantified associations\
  \ of GAD with TSI in the total population and population stratified by PA status.\
  \ Participants with GAD had lower TSI (b=-1.416, p=0.008) compared to those without\
  \ GAD. However, this association was modified by PA. Among participants who met\
  \ the PA guidelines, TSI did not differ according to GAD status (b=-0.800, p=0.398).\
  \ For participants who did not meet the guidelines TSI was significantly lower among\
  \ those with GAD (b=-1.758, p=0.004). These findings suggest that PA may help to\
  \ protect brain health among older adults with GAD."
