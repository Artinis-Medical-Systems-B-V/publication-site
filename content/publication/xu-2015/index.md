abstract: Genome-wide gene expression measurements have enabled comprehensive studies
  that integrate the changes of gene expression and phenotypic information to uncover
  their novel associations. Here we reported the association analysis between psychophysical
  phenotypes and genome-wide gene expression changes in human adaptation to one of
  the most extreme climates on Earth, the Antarctic Dome Argus. Dome A is the highest
  ice feature in Antarctica, and may be the coldest, driest and windiest location
  on earth. It is considered unapproachable due to its hostile environment. In 2007,
  a Chinese team of 17 male explorers made the expedition to Dome A for scientific
  investigation. Overall, 133 psychophysical phenotypes were recorded, and genome-wide
  gene expression profiles from the blood samples of the explorers were measured before
  their departure and upon their arrival at Dome A. We found that mood disturbances,
  including tension (anxiety), depression, anger and fatigue, had a strong, positive,
  linear relationship with the level of a male sex hormone, testosterone, using the
  Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) analysis. We also demonstrated that significantly
  lowest-level Gene Ontology groups in changes of gene expression in blood cells with
  erythrocyte removal were consistent with the adaptation of the psychophysical characteristics.
  Interestingly, we discovered a list of genes that were strongly related to significant
  phenotypes using phenotype and gene expression PCC analysis. Importantly, among
  the 70 genes that were identified, most were significantly related to mood disturbances,
  where 42 genes have been reported in the literature mining, suggesting that the
  other 28 genes were likely novel genes involved in the mood disturbance mechanism.
  Taken together, our association analysis provides a reliable method to uncover novel
  genes and mechanisms related to phenotypes, although further studies are needed.
