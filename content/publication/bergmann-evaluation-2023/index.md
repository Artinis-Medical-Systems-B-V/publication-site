abstract: Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2), a method of cerebral tissue
  oxygenation measurement, is recorded using non-invasive near-infrared Spectroscopy
  (NIRS) devices. A major limitation is that recorded signals often contain artifacts.
  Manually removing these artifacts is both resource and time consuming. The objective
  was to evaluate the applicability of using wavelet analysis as an automated method
  for simple signal loss artifact clearance of rSO2 signals obtained from commercially
  available devices. A retrospective observational study using existing populations
  (healthy control (HC), elective spinal surgery patients (SP), and traumatic brain
  injury patients (TBI)) was conducted. Arterial blood pressure (ABP) and rSO2 data
  were collected in all patients. Wavelet analysis was determined to be successful
  in removing simple signal loss artifacts using wavelet coefficients and coherence
  to detect signal loss artifacts in rSO2 signals. The removal success rates in HC,
  SP, and TBI populations were 100%, 99.8%, and 99.7%, respectively (though it had
  limited precision in determining the exact point in time). Thus, wavelet analysis
  may prove to be useful in a layered approach NIRS signal artifact tool utilizing
  higher-frequency data; however, future work is needed.
