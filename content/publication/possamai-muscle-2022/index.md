abstract: 'Purpose: The muscle oxygen uptake (mV˙O2) kinetics following exercise,
  measured by near-infrared spectroscopy, has been used as a functional evaluation
  of muscle oxidative metabolism. This study aimed to determine the mV˙O2 off-kinetics
  and verify the relationship of the recovery rate of mV˙O2 (k) with time-trial performance
  and different aerobic parameters in trained rowers. Methods: Eleven male rowers
  (age: 20 ± 3 years; V˙O2max: 4.28 ± 0.35 L·min−1) used a rowing ergometer to perform
  (I) an incremental test to determine the maximal oxygen uptake (V˙O2max) and peak
  power output (Ppeak); (II) several visits to determine maximal lactate steady state
  (MLSS); and (III) a 2000-m rowing ergometer performance test. Also, one test to
  determine mV˙O2 off-kinetics of the vastus lateralis muscle using a repeated arterial
  occlusions protocol. Results: The mV˙O2 generated a good monoexponential fit (R2
  = 0.960 ± 0.030; SEE = 0.041 ± 0.018%.s−1). The k of mV˙O2 (2.06 ± 0.58 min−1) was
  associated with relative V˙O2max (r = 0.79), power output at MLSS (r = 0.76), and
  Ppeak (r = 0.83); however, it was not related with 2000-m rowing performance (r
  = −0.38 to 0.52; p textgreater .152). Conclusion: These findings suggest that although
  not associated with rowing performance, the mV˙O2 off-kinetics determined after
  a submaximal isometric knee extension may be a practical and less-exhaustive approach
  than invasive responses and incremental tests to assess the muscle oxidative metabolism
  during a training program.'
