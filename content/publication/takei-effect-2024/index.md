abstract: 'Abstract: Hypoxic exercise, which can induce arterial and tissue deoxygenation,
  promotes physiological adaptations. However, reduced oxygen availability can lower
  the absolute training intensity (i.e., mechanical stress). Adding normoxic recovery
  to sprint interval exercise (SIE) is one potential approach to strike a balance
  between providing a hypoxic stimulus and maintaining the absolute training intensity.
  However, the effects of adding normoxic recovery to SIE on performance and physiological
  responses are uncertain. We tested the hypothesis that hypoxic SIE with normoxic
  recovery enhances arterial deoxygenation and muscle deoxygenation levels without
  impeding performance compared to an entirely normoxic condition. On separate days,
  seven male sprinters performed 4 × 30‐s ‘all‐out’ cycle sprints with 4.5‐min recovery
  with hypoxic exposure (FiO2 : 12.7%O 2) applied continuously (hypoxia, HYP), intermittently
  during sprint periods only (intermittent, INT), or not at all (normoxia, NOR). Power
  output, oxygen saturation, muscle oxygenation, surface electromyography (EMG) activity,
  heart rate, blood lactate concentration, and ratings of perceived exertion were
  measured. The total work significantly decreased in HYP than NOR (p textless 0.05)
  and INT (p textless 0.01). The aTrterial oxygen saturation was lower during HYP
  than NOR (∼86% vs. ∼97%; p textless 0.001), while lower values were also obtained
  for INT than NOR during sprint periods (∼85% vs. ∼97%; p textless 0.001) but not
  during recovery periods (∼96% vs. ∼97%). The heart rate differed (p textless 0.05)
  between conditions (NOR: ∼164 bpm; INT: ∼160 bpm; HYP: ∼156 bpm). No other variables
  demonstrated significant differences between conditions. Adding hypoxia during exercise
  while recovering in normoxia did not compromise exercise capacity during SIE, despite
  inducing larger arterial deoxygenation levels compared to normoxia. Highlights:
  Utilizing severe hypoxia during exercise and normoxia during recovery induces a
  substantial hypoxic stimulus while safeguarding mechanical performance in sprinters.
  This approach maintains neuromuscular, metabolic, and perceptual parameters without
  any detrimental effects, ensuring athletes can perform at their best. Alternating
  hypoxia and normoxia during active and passive phases shows potential for optimizing
  hypoxic training, striking an ideal balance between the hypoxic stimulus and training
  intensity and load.'
