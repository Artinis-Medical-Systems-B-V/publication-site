abstract: "The aim of this study was to compare cardiovascular hemodynamics and cerebral\
  \ oxygenation/perfusion (COP) during and after maximal incremental exercise in obese\
  \ individuals according to their aerobic fitness versus age-matched healthy controls\
  \ (AMHC). Fifty-four middle\u2013aged obese (OB) and 16 AMHC were recruited. Maximal\
  \ cardiopulmonary function (gas exchange analysis), cardiac hemodynamics (impedance\
  \ cardiography), and left frontal COP (near-infrared spectroscopy: NIRS) were measured\
  \ continuously during a maximal incremental ergocycle test. During recovery, reoxygenation/perfusion\
  \ rate (ROPR: oxyhemoglobin: $\u0394$O2Hb, deoxyhemoglobin: $\u0394$HHb and total\
  \ hemoglobin: $\u0394$tHb; with NIRS) was also measured. Obese participants (OB,\
  \ n\_=\_54) were divided into two groups according to the median peak: the low-fit\
  \ obese (LF-OB, n\_=\_27) and the high-fit obese (HF-OB, n\_=\_27). During exercise,\
  \ end tidal pressure of CO2 (PETCO2), and COP ($\u0394$O2Hb, $\u0394$HHb and $\u0394\
  $tHb) did not differ between groups (OB, LF-OB, HF-OB, AMHC). During recovery, PETCO2\
  \ and ROPR ($\u0394$O2Hb, $\u0394$HHb and $\u0394$tHb) were similar between the\
  \ groups (OB, LF-OB, HF-OB, AMHC). During exercise and recovery, cardiac index was\
  \ lower (P\_<\_0.05) in LF-OB versus the other two groups (HF-OB, AMHC). As well,\
  \ systolic blood pressure was higher during exercise in the OB, LF-OB and HF-OB\
  \ groups versus AMHC (P\_<\_0.05). When compared to AMHC, obese individuals (OB,\
  \ LF-OB, HF-OB) have a similar cerebral vasoreactivity by CO2 and cerebral hemodynamics\
  \ during exercise and recovery, but a higher systolic blood pressure during exercise.\
  \ Higher fitness in obese subjects (HF-OB) seems to preserve their cardiopulmonary\
  \ and cardiac function during exercise and recovery."
