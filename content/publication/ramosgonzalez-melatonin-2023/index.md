abstract: 'Abstract  High sodium diets (HSD) can cause vascular dysfunction, in part
  due to increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS). Melatonin reduces ROS in healthy
  and clinical populations and may improve vascular function. The purpose was to determine
  the effect of melatonin supplementation on vascular function and ROS during 10 days
  of a HSD. We hypothesized that melatonin supplementation during a HSD would improve
  vascular function and decrease ROS levels compared to HSD alone. Twenty‐seven participants
  (13 M/14 W, 26.7 ± 2.9 years, BMI: 23.6 ± 2.0 kg/m 2 , BP: 110 ± 9/67 ± 7 mmHg)
  were randomized to a 10‐day HSD (6900 mg sodium/d) supplemented with either 10 mg
  of melatonin (HSD + MEL) or a placebo (HSD + PL) daily. Brachial artery flow‐mediated
  dilation, a measure of macrovascular function, (HSD + PL: 7.1 ± 3.8%; HSD + MEL:
  6.7 ± 3.4%; p = 0.59) and tissue oxygenation index (TSI) reperfusion rate, a measure
  of microvascular reactivity, (HSD + PL: 0.21 ± 0.06%/s; HSD + MEL: 0.21 ± 0.08%/s;
  p = 0.97) and TSI area under the curve (HSD + PL: 199899 ± 10,863 a.u.; HSD + MEL:
  20315 ± 11,348 a.u.; p = 0.17) were similar at the end of each condition. Neither
  nitroxide molarity (HSD + PL: 7.8 × 10 −5 ± 4.1 × 10 −5 mol/L; HSD + MEL: 8.7 × 10
  −5 ± 5.1 × 10 −5 mol/L; p = 0.55) nor free radical number (HSD + PL: 8.0 × 10 15
  ± 4.4 × 10 15 ; HSD + MEL: 9.0 × 10 15 ± 4.9 × 10 15 ; p = 0.51) were different
  between conditions. Melatonin supplementation did not alter vascular function or
  ROS levels while on a HSD in this sample of young healthy normotensive adults.'
