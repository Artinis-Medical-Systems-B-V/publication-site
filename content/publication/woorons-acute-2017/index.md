abstract: "Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the acute responses to repeated-sprint\
  \ exercise (RSE) in hypoxia induced by voluntary hypoventilation at low lung volume\
  \ (VHL). Methods: Nine well-trained subjects performed two sets of eight 6-s sprints\
  \ on a cycle ergometer followed by 24\_s of inactive recovery. RSE was randomly\
  \ carried out either with normal breathing (RSN) or with VHL (RSH-VHL). Peak (PPO)\
  \ and mean power output (MPO) of each sprint were measured. Arterial oxygen saturation,\
  \ heart rate (HR), gas exchange and muscle concentrations of oxy-([O2Hb]) and deoxyhaemoglobin/myoglobin\
  \ ([HHb]) were continuously recorded throughout exercise. Blood lactate concentration\
  \ ([La]) was measured at the end of the first (S1) and second set (S2). Results:\
  \ There was no difference in PPO and MPO between conditions in all sprints. Arterial\
  \ oxygen saturation (87.7 \xB1 3.6 vs 96.9 \xB1 1.8% at the last sprint) and HR\
  \ were lower in RSH-VHL than in RSN during most part of exercise. The changes in\
  \ [O2Hb] and [HHb] were greater in RSH-VHL at S2. Oxygen uptake was significantly\
  \ higher in RSH-VHL than in RSN during the recovery periods following sprints at\
  \ S2 (3.02 \xB1 0.4 vs 2.67 \xB1 0.5\_L min\u22121 on average) whereas [La] was\
  \ lower in RSH-VHL at the end of exercise (10.3 \xB1 2.9 vs 13.8 \xB1 3.5\_mmol.L\u2212\
  1; p < 0.01). Conclusions: This study shows that performing RSE with VHL led to\
  \ larger arterial and muscle deoxygenation than with normal breathing while maintaining\
  \ similar power output. This kind of exercise may be worth using for performing\
  \ repeated sprint training in hypoxia."
