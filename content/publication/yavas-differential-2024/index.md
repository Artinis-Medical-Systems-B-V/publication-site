abstract: Emotional working memory (WM) involves retaining and processing emotionally
  charged information, integrating emotions into cognitive tasks like decision-making
  and attention management. While anxiety affects dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)
  activity, research on how different anxiety levels impact WM remains inconclusive.
  To investigate this, participants were divided into Mild and Moderate anxiety groups
  based on their Beck Anxiety Inventory scores. Their performance on 2-back emotional
  WM task was compared both behaviorally and neurologically. Functional near-infrared
  spectroscopy was used to measure oxyhemoglobin levels in the dlPFC. The results
  showed that both groups had similar performance, with no significant differences
  in correct responses to the spatial location of emotional face stimuli. This suggests
  that emotional stimuli do not affect WM performance between groups. However, imaging
  data revealed hemisphere-specific differences in oxyhemoglobin changes, with no
  significant difference between hemispheres. The Moderate anxiety group exhibited
  reduced oxyhemoglobin levels in the right dlPFC compared to Mild anxiety group,
  while no significant difference was observed in the left dlPFC. These findings indicate
  that the degree of anxiety in healthy individuals affects WM processes in the right
  dlPFC, although this differs slightly from findings comparing high and low anxiety
  scores in healthy or diagnosed anxiety participants. Notably, these differences
  did not impair WM performance when participants provided non-verbal responses. This
  suggests that moderate anxiety may alter the neural mechanisms underlying WM without
  affecting the output of non-verbal tasks. Further research is needed to understand
  how WM, with or without emotional components, varies between individuals with mild
  and moderate anxiety levels.
