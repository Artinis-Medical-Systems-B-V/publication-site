abstract: Negative consequences of stress are a pervasive problem in our modern society.
  Recent developments in wearable lifestyle hardware have led to unobtrusive, sensor-packed,
  always-on devices that might finally be able to continuously monitor biosignals
  to detect, determine or even prevent stress or some of its negative outcomes. In
  this work, we give a concise overview of a majority of biosignals that are in some
  way relevant for stress classification and outline state-of-the-art machine learning
  algorithms for this task. Additionally, we provide a list of all recent wearables
  including an evaluation of their feasibility to implement such algorithms as well
  as directions to look for an assessment of the accuracy and validity of their recorded
  data with respect to stress tracking.
