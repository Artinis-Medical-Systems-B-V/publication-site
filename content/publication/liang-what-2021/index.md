abstract: People with mental stress often experience disturbed sleep, suggesting stress-related
  abnormalities in brain activity during sleep. However, no study has looked at the
  physiological oscillations in brain hemodynamics during sleep in relation to stress.
  In this pilot study, we aimed to explore the relationships between bedtime stress
  and the hemodynamics in the prefrontal cortex during the first sleep cycle. We tracked
  the stress biomarkers, salivary cortisol, and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA)
  on a daily basis and utilized the days of lower levels of measured stress as natural
  controls to the days of higher levels of measured stress. Cortical hemodynamics
  was measured using a cutting-edge wearable functional near-infrared spectroscopy
  (fNIRS) system. Time-domain, frequency-domain features as well as nonlinear features
  were derived from the cleaned hemodynamic signals. We proposed an original ensemble
  algorithm to generate an average importance score for each feature based on the
  assessment of six statistical and machine learning techniques. With all channels
  counted in, the top five most referred feature types are Hurst exponent, mean, the
  ratio of the major/minor axis standard deviation of the Poincar√© plot of the signal,
  statistical complexity, and crest factor. The left rostral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC)
  was the most relevant sub-region. Significantly strong correlations were found between
  the hemodynamic features derived at this sub-region and all three stress indicators.
  The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is also a relevant cortical area. The
  areas of mid-DLPFC and caudal-DLPFC both demonstrated significant and moderate association
  to all three stress indicators. No relevance was found in the ventrolateral prefrontal
  cortex. The preliminary results shed light on the possible role of the RLPCF, especially
  the left RLPCF, in processing stress during sleep. In addition, our findings echoed
  the previous stress studies conducted during wake time and provides supplementary
  evidence on the relevance of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in stress responses
  during sleep. This pilot study serves as a proof-of-concept for a new research paradigm
  to stress research and identified exciting opportunities for future studies.
