abstract: Robotics holds the potential to streamline the execution of repetitive and
  dangerous tasks, which are difficult or impossible for a human operator. However,
  in complex scenarios, such as nuclear waste management or disaster response, full
  automation often proves unfeasible due to the diverse and intricate nature of tasks,
  coupled with the unpredictable hazards, and is typically prevented by stringent
  regulatory frameworks. Consequently, the predominant approach to managing activities
  in such settings remains human teleoperation. Teleoperation can be demanding, especially
  in high-stress situations, and involves a complex blend of both cognitive and physical
  workload. We present an experiment to explore a range of physiological and performance-related
  metrics for workload assessment during robotic teleoperation. Thirty-five participants
  performed a teleoperation task, during which we manipulated cognitive and physical
  workload conditions. We recorded multiple metrics, including brain activity using
  functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy, galvanic skin responses, cardiovascular responses,
  subjective workload ratings, task and robot performance data. Our results suggest
  that robotic teleoperation performance may be the most robust metric for distinguishing
  between different levels of workload experienced during teleoperation, with most
  physiological measures becoming insignificant to distinguish high cognitive workload.
