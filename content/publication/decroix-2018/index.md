abstract: 'During exercise in hypoxia, O2 delivery to brain and muscle is compromised,
  and oxidative stress is elicited. Cocoa flavanols (CF) have antioxidant capacities
  and can increase blood flow by stimulating endothelial function. We aimed to examine
  the effects of 7-day CF intake on oxidative stress, nitric oxide production, and
  tissue oxygenation in response to exercise in normobaric hypoxia (14.3% O2). In
  a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study, 14 well-trained male cyclists completed
  four trials: exercise in normoxia or hypoxia, after 7-day CF or placebo intake.
  Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was measured before intake of the last dose CF or placebo.
  One hundred minutes later, 20-min steady-state (SS; 45% V O2max) and 20-min time
  trial (TT) (cycling) were performed. Blood samples were taken. Prefrontal and muscular
  oxygenation was assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy. At baseline, FMD was increased
  by CF. Hypoxia increased exercise-induced elevations in lipid peroxidation and antioxidant
  capacity. CF suppressed exercise-induced lipid peroxidation but did not influence
  antioxidant capacity. At rest and during SS, prefrontal and muscular oxygenation
  was decreased by hypoxia. CF elevated prefrontal oxygenation but did not impact
  muscular oxygenation. During TT, hypoxia accelerated the exercise-induced decrease
  in prefrontal oxygenation, but not in muscular oxygenation. During TT, CF did not
  alter prefrontal and muscular oxygenation. CF did not change plasma nitrite, nitrate,
  and arginine:citrulline. During high-intensity exercise, CF improved neither tissue
  oxygenation nor performance in well-trained athletes. At rest and during moderate-intensity
  exercise, CF reduced exercise-induced lipid peroxidation and partially restored
  the hypoxia-induced decline in prefrontal oxygenation. NEW & NOTEWORTHY For the
  first time, we showed that CF had beneficial effects on endothelial function at
  rest, as well as on prefrontal oxygenation at rest and during moderate-intensity
  exercise, both in normoxia and hypoxia. Moreover, we showed that CF intake inhibited
  oxidative stress during exhaustive exercise in hypoxia.'
