abstract: "Purpose: We aimed to identify a blood flow restriction (BFR) endurance\
  \ exercise protocol that would both maximize cardiopulmonary and metabolic strain,\
  \ and minimize the perception of effort. Methods: Twelve healthy males (23\_\xB1\
  \_2\_years, 75\_\xB1\_7\_kg) performed five different exercise protocols in randomized\
  \ order: HI, high-intensity exercise starting at 105% of the incremental peak power\
  \ (Ppeak); I-BFR30, intermittent BFR at 30% Ppeak; C-BFR30, continuous BFR at 30%\
  \ Ppeak; CON30, control exercise without BFR at 30% Ppeak; I-BFR0, intermittent\
  \ BFR during unloaded exercise. Cardiopulmonary, gastrocnemius oxygenation (StO2),\
  \ capillary lactate ([La]), and perceived exertion (RPE) were measured. Results:\
  \ V\u0307O2, ventilation (V\u0307E), heart rate (HR), [La] and RPE were greater\
  \ in HI than all other protocols. However, muscle StO2 was not different between\
  \ HI (set1\u201457.8\_\xB1\_5.8; set2\u201458.1\_\xB1\_7.2%) and I-BRF30 (set1\u2014\
  59.4\_\xB1\_4.1; set2\u201460.5\_\xB1\_6.6%, p\_<\_0.05). While physiologic responses\
  \ were mostly similar between I-BFR30 and C-BFR30, [La] was greater in I-BFR30 (4.2\_\
  \xB1\_1.1 vs. 2.6\_\xB1\_1.1\_mmol\_L\u22121, p\_=\_0.014) and RPE was less (5.6\_\
  \xB1\_2.1 and 7.4\_\xB1\_2.6; p\_=\_0.014). I-BFR30 showed similar reduced muscle\
  \ StO2 compared with HI, and increased blood lactate compared to C-BFR30 exercise.\
  \ Conclusion: Therefore, this study demonstrate that endurance cycling with intermittent\
  \ BFR promotes muscle deoxygenation and metabolic strain, which may translate into\
  \ increased endurance training adaptations while minimizing power output and RPE."
