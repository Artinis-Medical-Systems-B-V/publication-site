abstract: 'Topical capsaicin reduces metaboreflex responses during post-exercise circulatory
  arrest (PECA) in males, but its effects in females and on microvascular responsiveness
  in either sex remain unclear. This study hypothesized that capsaicin would reduce
  blood pressure during PECA in males but not females, and enhance microvascular responsiveness
  in both sexes. Healthy males (n = 9) and females (n = 11) were randomly assigned
  to one of three conditions: capsaicin applied to the exercising arm, capsaicin applied
  to the non-exercising arm, or no capsaicin (control). Blood pressure was measured
  via the brachial artery during a handgrip exercise at 30% maximal voluntary contraction,
  followed by PECA using a rapid inflation cuff. Microvascular responsiveness was
  assessed with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during a post-occlusive reactive
  hyperemia test, conducted before and twice after capsaicin application. Capsaicin
  did not significantly alter blood pressure during PECA (p textgreater 0.05), but
  a significant interaction was observed for microvascular responsiveness (p = 0.01).
  Although topical capsaicin did not attenuate metaboreflex-induced blood pressure
  changes, it enhanced microvascular responsiveness in the exercising arm compared
  to the systemic control. These findings suggest localized vascular benefits of capsaicin,
  but no clear impact on the metaboreflex. Further research is needed to clarify sex-specific
  responses to topical capsaicin.'
