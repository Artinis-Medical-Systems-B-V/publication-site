abstract: "Aim/Hypothesis: This cross-sectional, observational, controlled study examined\
  \ cerebral oxygenation during exercise, an index of cerebrovascular function and\
  \ cortical activation, in pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus\
  \ (GDM) and unaffected pregnancies. The association of cerebral oxygenation with\
  \ macrovascular and cardiovascular function indices was also evaluated. Material\
  \ and Methods: Vascular function and structure [aortic pulse-wave-velocity (PWV),\
  \ augmentation index (AI), carotid intima-media thickness], as well as 24-hour ambulatory\
  \ blood pressure (BP) were assessed in women with GDM (n = 21) and uncomplicated\
  \ pregnancies (n = 16), at 26\u201332 gestational weeks. Changes in cerebral oxygenation\
  \ [oxy- (O2Hb), deoxy- (HHb) and total- (tHb) hemoglobin] were continuously recorded\
  \ by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during intermittent handgrip exercise. Beat-by-beat\
  \ BP and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) were assessed (Finapres). Results: Women\
  \ with GDM had higher AI than controls. During exercise, women with GDM maintained\
  \ a smaller force (p < 0.05), despite similar ratings of perceived exertion. Despite\
  \ similar increases in BP during exercise, the GDM group exhibited a lower average\
  \ and total (AUC) increase in cerebral-O2Hb than controls (p < 0.05). In addition,\
  \ GDM exhibited a slower rate of cerebral-O2Hb decay during recovery (p < 0.05).\
  \ SVR was lower in GDM compared to controls throughout the protocol (p < 0.01).\
  \ Cerebral oxygenation indices were correlated with PWV and AI (p < 0.05). Conclusions:\
  \ This study provided novel evidence for blunted cerebral oxygenation during exercise\
  \ in women with GDM compared to uncomplicated pregnancies, suggesting a link between\
  \ reduced cerebrovascular function with exercise intolerance in GDM. Cerebral oxygenation\
  \ during physical stress was correlated with macrovascular function and cardiovascular\
  \ risk factors. More studies are needed to examine whether this impaired cerebral\
  \ oxygenation reflects early cerebrovascular disease."
