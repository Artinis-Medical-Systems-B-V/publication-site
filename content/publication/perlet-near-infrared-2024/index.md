abstract: 'Background: Venous occlusion plethysmography (VOP) non-invasively measures
  forearm blood flow (FBF), whereas near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) assesses skeletal
  muscle oxygenation. Using these techniques has revealed sex differences in microvascular
  responses. However, it is not clear if NIRS and VOP results are interchangeable
  under various conditions like reactive hyperemia (RH). Our purpose was to evaluate
  sex-specific associations between FBF and NIRS-derived parameters: oxygenated hemoglobin,
  deoxygenated hemoglobin, total hemoglobin, and hemoglobin difference (O2Hb, HHb,
  tHb, and HbDiff). Methods: In total, 29 adults (15 men) participated, and a strain-gauge
  was placed on the forearm for VOP and a NIRS device was distally attached. Slopes
  for FBF and NIRS parameters were quantified during venous occlusion intervals at
  rest and during RH. Pearson’s correlations were assessed between VOP and NIRS slopes.
  Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC2,1) examined the sex-specific consistency
  of the slopes at rest. p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Results: During RH,
  FBF was not correlated with O2Hb (r = −0.126), HHb (r = 0.228), tHb (r = 0.061),
  or HbDiff (r = 0.046). Seemingly, there were no sex differences. Resting FBF and
  NIRS-derived variables, except for HbDiff, displayed suitable consistency as suggested
  by the reliability results (ICC2,1 = 0.115–0.577). Conclusions: The NIRS values
  collected did not match the strain-gauge slopes. Individuals should practice caution
  when generating blood flow inferences from NIRS-based data during VOP.'
