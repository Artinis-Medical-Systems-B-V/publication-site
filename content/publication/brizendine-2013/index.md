abstract: "Purpose: To determine whether near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements\
  \ of muscle mitochondrial function could detect the expected differences between\
  \ endurance-trained athletes (n = 8) and inactive subjects (n = 8). Methods: Muscle\
  \ oxygen consumption (mV\u0307O2) of the vastus lateralis was measured with continuous-wave\
  \ NIRS using transient arterial occlusions. The recovery rate of mV\u0307O2 after\
  \ electrical stimulation was fit to an exponential curve, with the time constant\
  \ (T C) used as an index of mitochondrial capacity. Whole-body peak oxygen uptake\
  \ was determined by indirect calorimetry during a continuous ramp protocol on a\
  \ cycle ergometer. Results: Whole-body peak oxygen uptake values for endurance-trained\
  \ and inactive controls were 73.5 \xB1 9.1 and 33.7 \xB1 5.9 mL\u02D9kg-1\u02D9\
  min-1, respectively (P < 0.001). The recovery rates of mV\u0307O2 after exercise\
  \ for endurance training were 18.4 \xB1 3.2 and 18.8 \xB1 2.5 s, whereas those for\
  \ inactive controls were 32.4 \xB1 5.2 and 34.9 \xB1 5.9 s for the shallow and deep\
  \ channels, respectively (P < 0.001 for comparison between groups). Resting mV\u0307\
  O2 was 0.52%\u02D9s-1 \xB1 0.22%\u02D9s-1 for endurance athletes and 0.77%\u02D9\
  s -1 \xB1 0.82%\u02D9s-1 for inactive controls (P = 0.42). Conclusions: The recovery\
  \ rates of mV\u0307O2 after exercise in endurance athletes were almost twofold faster\
  \ than inactive subjects measured with NIRS, consistent with previous studies using\
  \ muscle biopsies and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Our results support the use\
  \ of NIRS measurements of the recovery of oxygen consumption to assess muscle oxidative\
  \ capacity. Copyright \xA9 2013 by the American College of Sports Medicine."
