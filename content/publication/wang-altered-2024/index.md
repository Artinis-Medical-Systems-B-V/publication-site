abstract: Living in high-expressed emotion (EE) environments, characterized by critical,
  hostile, or over-involved family attitudes, has been linked to increased relapse
  rates among individuals with schizophrenia (SZ). In our previous work (Wang et al.,
  2023), we conducted the first feasibility study of using functional near-infrared
  spectroscopy (fNIRS) with our developed EE stimuli to examine cortical hemodynamics
  in SZ. To better understand the neural mechanisms underlying EE environmental factors
  in SZ, we extended our investigation by employing functional connectivity (FC) analysis
  with a graph theory approach to fNIRS signals. Relative to healthy controls (N =
  40), individuals with SZ (N = 37) exhibited altered connectivity across the medial
  prefrontal cortex (mPFC), left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), and left
  superior temporal gyrus (STG) while exposed to EE environments. Notably, while individuals
  with SZ were exposed to high-EE environments, (i) reduced connectivity was observed
  in these brain regions and (ii) the left vlPFC-STG coupling was found to be associated
  with the negative symptom severity. Taken together, our FC findings suggest individuals
  with SZ experience a more extensive disruption in neural functioning and coordination,
  particularly indicating an increased susceptibility to high-EE environments. This
  further supports the potential utility of integrating fNIRS with the created EE
  stimuli for assessing EE environmental influences, paving the way for more targeted
  therapeutic interventions.
