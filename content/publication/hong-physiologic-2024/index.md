abstract: 'Background: The hemodynamics of prefrontal cortex (PFC) oxygenation are
  regulated by numerous processes operating over multiple temporal scales, producing
  complex patterns in its output fluctuations. Age may alter this multiscale regulation
  of PFC oxygenation, leading to diminished physiologic complexity of this important
  regulatory process. We aimed to characterize the effects of age on such complexity
  and its relationship to performance of an executive n-back task. Methods: Twenty-four
  younger (aged 28±3 years) and 27 older (aged 78±6 years) adults completed this study.
  Continuous oxygenation (HbO2) and deoxygenation (HHb) signals of PFC were recorded
  using functional near-infrared-spectroscopy (fNIRS) while participants stood and
  watched a blank screen (blank), clicked a mouse when an X appeared (IdX) or when
  a letter was repeated from “2-back” in a sequence shown on a screen (2-back). We
  used multiscale entropy to quantify the HbO2 and HHb complexity of fNIRS signals.
  Results: Older adults exhibited lower HbO2 and HHb complexity compared to younger
  adults, regardless of task (p=0.0005~0.002). Both groups exhibited greater complexity
  during the IdX and 2-back than blank task (p=0.02~0.04). Across all participants,
  those with greater HbO2 and/or HHb complexity during the blank task exhibited faster
  IdX and 2-back reaction time (β=-0.56~-0.6, p=0.009~0.02). Those demonstrating greater
  increase of HbO2 and/or HHb complexity from IdX to 2-back task had lower percent
  increase in reaction time from IdX to 2-back task (β=-0.41~-0.37, p=0.005~0.01).
  Conclusion: The complexity of fNIRS-measured PFC oxygenation fluctuations may capture
  the influence of aging on the regulation of prefrontal hemodynamics involved in
  executive-function-based task performance.'
