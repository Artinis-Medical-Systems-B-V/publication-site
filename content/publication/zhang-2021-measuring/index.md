abstract: "The bone vascular system is important; yet, evaluation of bone hemodynamics\
  \ is difficult and expensive. This study evaluated the utility and reliability of\
  \ near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), a portable and relatively inexpensive device,\
  \ in measuring tibial hemodynamics and metabolic rate. Eleven participants were\
  \ tested twice using post-occlusive reactive hyperemia technique with the NIRS probes\
  \ placed on the tibia and the medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle. Measurements were\
  \ made at rest and after two levels of plantarflexion exercise. The difference between\
  \ oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin signal (HbDiff) could be reliably measured\
  \ with small coefficients of variation (CV; range 5.7 \u2013 9.8%) and high intraclass\
  \ correlation coefficients (ICC; range 0.73 \u2013 0.91). Deoxygenated hemoglobin\
  \ rate of change, a potential marker for bone metabolism, also showed good reliability\
  \ (CV range 7.5 \u2013 9.8%, ICC range 0.90 \u2013 0.93). The tibia was characterized\
  \ with a much slower metabolic rate compared to MG (p < 0.001). While exercise significantly\
  \ increased MG metabolic rate in a dose-dependent manner (all p < 0.05), no changes\
  \ were observed for the tibia after exercise compared to rest (all p > 0.05). NIRS\
  \ is a suitable tool for monitoring hemodynamics and metabolism in the tibia. However,\
  \ the local muscle exercise protocol utilized in the current study did not influence\
  \ bone hemodynamics or metabolic rate. Novelty bullets \u2022 NIRS can be used to\
  \ monitor tibial hemodynamics and metabolism with good reliability. \u2022 Short-duration\
  \ local muscle exercise increased metabolic rate in muscle but not in bone. \u2022\
  \ High level of loading and exercise volume may be needed to elicit measurable metabolic\
  \ changes in bone."
