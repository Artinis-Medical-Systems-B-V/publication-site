abstract: "Postural instability and falls are commonly seen because of aging and motor\
  \ disabilities. This study aims to assess the posture-related changes in brain functional\
  \ connectivity by wavelet phase coherence (WPCO) of oxyhemoglobin concentration\
  \ change ($\u0394$[HbO2]) signals measured through near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)\
  \ in elderly subjects. The NIRS signals were continuously recorded from the prefrontal\
  \ cortex and sensorimotor cortical areas in 39 healthy elderly subjects and 22 young\
  \ healthy subjects during 20\_min resting and 10\_min standing states. Eight connection\
  \ types were obtained from the recorded brain areas. The WPCO were calculated in\
  \ five frequency intervals in each channel pair as follows: I, 0.6\u20132\_Hz; II,\
  \ 0.145\u20130.6\_Hz; III, 0.052\u20130.145\_Hz; IV, 0.021\u20130.052\_Hz; and V,\
  \ 0.0095\u20130.021\_Hz. Results show that posture change and age significantly\
  \ interacts with the right prefrontal cortex (PFC) and left sensorimotor cortex\
  \ (SMC) connectivity in interval V (F\_=\_5.010, p\_=\_0.028). The left and right\
  \ PFC connectivity in interval I, the left and right SMC connectivity in interval\
  \ IV, and the connectivity in interval V, including right PFC and right SMC connectivity,\
  \ left PFC and left SMC connectivity, and right PFC and left SMC connectivity, showed\
  \ a significant difference between the Group Elderly and Group Young in response\
  \ to posture change (p\_<\_0.05). This study provides new insight into the mechanism\
  \ of posture control, and results may be useful in assessing the risk of postural\
  \ instability in aged persons."
