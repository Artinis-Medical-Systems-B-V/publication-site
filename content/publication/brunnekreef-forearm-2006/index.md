abstract: "Despite the social impact of repetitive strain injury (RSI), little is\
  \ known about its pathophysiological mechanism. The main objective of this study\
  \ was to assess the local muscle oxygenation (mVO2) and blood flow (mBF) of the\
  \ forearm in individuals with RSI during isometric contractions of the forearm.\
  \ We employed the non-invasive optical technique near-infrared spectroscopy to assess\
  \ forearm VO2 and BF. These variables were assessed at 10%, 20%, and 40% of their\
  \ individual maximal voluntary strength. Twenty-two patients with RSI symptoms in\
  \ both arms (bilateral RSI) and 30 healthy age-matched subjects participated in\
  \ this cross-sectional study. The results showed lower mVO2 during exercise and\
  \ a reduced mBF after exercise. The results suggest that mVO2 and mVO2 are lower\
  \ in the forearms of individuals with RSI compared with their controls at similar\
  \ working intensities. This finding indicates that the underlying vasculature may\
  \ be impaired. Although these findings contribute to the understanding of RSI, future\
  \ research is necessary to further unravel the mechanisms of this area. \xA9 2006\
