abstract: 'Background: Manual breathing assist technique (MBAT) is a common physical
  therapy technique used to facilitate airway clearance and improve ventilation and
  oxygenation. The effects during and immediately after intervention in individuals
  with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are unknown. This study aimed
  to investigate the acute effects and potential mechanisms of MBAT on lung volume,
  dyspnea, and oxygenation in individuals with COPD. Methods: This non-randomized
  quasi-experimental pre-test/post-test study included participants from pulmonary
  rehabilitation programs at Tagami Hospital (COPD group) and a community exercise
  program (Healthy group). During a single session, MBAT was applied during the expiration
  of every breath for 10 minutes. Dyspnea and lung volumes (tidal volume; VT, inspiratory
  capacity; IC, inspiratory reserved capacity; IRV, expiratory reserve capacity; ERV)
  were collected at baseline and after MBAT. Pulse oximetry (SpO2), skeletal muscle
  oxygenation (SmO2), and oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin (O2Hb and HHb) using near-infrared
  spectroscopy (NIRS) were collected at baseline, during, and after MBAT. Between-group
  comparisons were conducted using the Mann-Whitney U-test and chi-square analyses.
  Within-group changes before and after MBAT were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank
  test. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to detect differences in NIRS variables in
  each phase and over time. Results: Thirty participants with COPD, matched for age
  and sex, were included, with 15 individuals per group. The difference scores of
  VT, IRV, and IC were significantly higher in the Healthy group than in the COPD
  group, but improvements in dyspnea and SpO2 were significantly higher in the COPD
  group. Compared to baseline, ERV decreased significantly in both groups, with dyspnea
  and SpO2 improving significantly only in the COPD group. Inspiratory accessory muscle
  ΔO2Hb and ΔHHb were significantly higher and lower (respectively) during MBAT in
  the COPD group compared to the Healthy group. Additionally, only the COPD group
  had increased SmO2 during and after MBAT compared to baseline. Conclusions: MBAT
  in patients with COPD had acute physiological effects in reducing dyspnea by facilitating
  expiration and decreasing the recruitment of accessory respiratory muscles. MBAT
  may help individuals with COPD reduce dyspnea before exercise therapy in a pulmonary
  rehabilitation program.'
