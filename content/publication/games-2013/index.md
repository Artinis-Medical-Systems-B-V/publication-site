abstract: "Whole-body vibration (WBV) is currently used to enhance performance and\
  \ treat injuries even though we lack an understanding of how WBV influences physiological\
  \ processes. An improved understanding of the physiological effects of WBV could\
  \ lead to protocols to speed healing or treat pathologies. This study examined the\
  \ acute effects of WBV on peripheral blood perfusion, muscle oxygenation, motoneuron\
  \ pool excitability, and sensory nerve conduction velocity. Fourteen healthy participants\
  \ [9 women (21.7\xB12.4years); 5 men (20.8\xB11.1years)] completed a 5min bout of\
  \ WBV (50Hz, 2mm amplitude). Measures were assessed pre-treatment and at 0, 5, 10,\
  \ 15, and 20min post-treatment. WBV significantly increased superficial skin temperature\
  \ (P<0.0005) and total hemoglobin (P=0.009), had no effect of oxyhemoglobin (P=0.186),\
  \ increased deoxyhemoglobin (P<0.0005), inhibited the soleus Hoffmann reflex (P=0.007),\
  \ and had no effect on sural sensory nerve conduction velocity (P=0.695). These\
  \ results suggest that an acute bout of WBV influences physiological processes in\
  \ both the circulatory and the nervous systems. \xA9 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S."
