abstract: "This study investigated the effect of completing additional warm-up strategies\
  \ in the transition phase between the pool warm up and the start of a race on elite\
  \ sprint swimming performance. Twenty-five elite swimmers (12 men, 20\_\xB1\_3\_\
  years; 13 women, 20\_\xB1\_2\_years, performance standard $\u223C$807 FINA2014 points)\
  \ completed a standardised pool warm up followed by a 30-min transition phase and\
  \ a 100-m freestyle time trial. During the transition phase, swimmers wore a tracksuit\
  \ jacket with integrated heating elements and performed a dry land-based exercise\
  \ routine (Combo), or a conventional tracksuit and remained seated (Control). Start\
  \ (1.5%\_\xB1\_1.0%, P\_=\_0.02; mean \xB1 90% confidence limits) and 100-m time\
  \ trial (0.8%\_\xB1\_0.4%, P\_<\_0.01) performances were improved in Combo. Core\
  \ temperature declined less (\u22120.2\xB0C\_\xB1\_0.1\xB0C versus \u22120.5\xB0\
  C\_\xB1\_0.1\xB0C, P\_=\_0.02) during the transition phase and total local (trapezius)\
  \ haemoglobin concentration was greater before the time trial in Combo (81\_\xB5\
  M\_\xB1\_25\_\xB5M versus 30\_\xB5M\_\xB1\_18\_\xB5M, P\_<\_0.01; mean\_\xB1\_standard\
  \ deviation) than in Control. Combining swimmers traditional pool warm up with passive\
  \ heating via heated jackets and completion of dry land-based exercises in the transition\
  \ phase improves elite sprint swimming performance by $\u223C$0.8%."
