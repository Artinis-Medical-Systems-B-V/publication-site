abstract: Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is used for brain hemodynamic
  assessment. Cortical hemodynamics are reliably estimated when the recorded signal
  has a sufficient quality. This is acquired when fNIRS optodes have proper scalp
  coupling. A lack of proper scalp coupling causes false positives and false negatives.
  Therefore, developing an objective algorithm for determining fNIRS signal quality
  is of great importance. In this study, we developed a machine learning-based algorithm
  for quantitatively rating fNIRS signal quality. Our promising results confirm the
  efficacy of the algorithm in determining fNIRS signal quality and hence decreasing
  misinterpretations.
