abstract: "In the past, the measurement of O2 consumption (\u022E2) by the muscle\
  \ could be carried out noninvasively by near-infrared spectroscopy from oxyhemoglobin\
  \ and/or deoxyhemoglobin measurements only at rest or during steady isometric contractions.\
  \ In the present study, a mathematical model is developed allowing calculation,\
  \ together with steady-state levels of \u022E2, of the kinetics of \u022E2 readjustment\
  \ in the muscle from the onset of ischemic but aerobic constant-load isotonic exercises.\
  \ The model, which is based on the known sequence of exoergonic metabolic pathways\
  \ involved in muscle energetics, allows simultaneous fitting of batched data obtained\
  \ during exercises performed at different workloads. A Monte Carlo simulation has\
  \ been carried out to test the quality of the model and to define the most appropriate\
  \ experimental approach to obtain the best results. The use of a series of experimental\
  \ protocols obtained at different levels of mechanical power, rather than repetitions\
  \ of the same load, appears to be the most suitable procedure."
