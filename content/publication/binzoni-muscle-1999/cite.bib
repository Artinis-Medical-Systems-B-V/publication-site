 abstract = {In the past, the measurement of O2 consumption (Ȯ2) by the muscle could be carried out noninvasively by near-infrared spectroscopy from oxyhemoglobin and/or deoxyhemoglobin measurements only at rest or during steady isometric contractions. In the present study, a mathematical model is developed allowing calculation, together with steady-state levels of Ȯ2, of the kinetics of Ȯ2 readjustment in the muscle from the onset of ischemic but aerobic constant-load isotonic exercises. The model, which is based on the known sequence of exoergonic metabolic pathways involved in muscle energetics, allows simultaneous fitting of batched data obtained during exercises performed at different workloads. A Monte Carlo simulation has been carried out to test the quality of the model and to define the most appropriate experimental approach to obtain the best results. The use of a series of experimental protocols obtained at different levels of mechanical power, rather than repetitions of the same load, appears to be the most suitable procedure.},
