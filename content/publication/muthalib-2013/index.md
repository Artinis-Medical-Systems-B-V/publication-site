abstract: Investigating human brain function can be improved byemploying a multimodal
  neuroimaging approach. The integrationof different non-invasive electrophysiological
  (e.g., electroenceph-alography-EEG and magnetoencephalography) and haemodynamic(e.g.,
  functional magnetic resonance imaging-fMRI and functionalnear-infrared spectroscopy-fNIRS)
  neuroimaging modalities simul-taneously measuring functional brain activation during
  motor andcognitive tasks compliments each other's limitations (Shibasaki,2008).
  Both EEG and MEG measure functional brain activity di-rectly by detecting the variations
  in electrical and magnetic fields,respectively, produced by neuronal activity across
  the scalp. BothfMRI and fNIRS measure functional brain activity indirectly viachanges
  in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (fMRI-BOLD in-crease) contrast signal and
  concentration changes in oxygenated(fNIRS-O2Hb increase) and deoxygenated (fNIRS-HHb
  decrease)haemoglobin, respectively, which are related to an increase in re-gional
  cerebral blood flow subsequent to increased neuronal activ-ity (i.e., neurovascular
  coupling). Since each neuroimagingmodality has its own characteristic features especially
  in termsof spatial and temporal resolution, previous studies have simulta-neously
  measured combinations of two out of the modalities dur-ing motor and cognitive tasks,
  and found good relationshipsbetween the techniques (Cui et al., 2011; Shibasaki,
  2008;Steinbrink et al., 2006).
