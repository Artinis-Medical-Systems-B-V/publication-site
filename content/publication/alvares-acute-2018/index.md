abstract: "Fish protein hydrolysates (FPH) have demonstrated in vitro anti-hypertensive\
  \ and antioxidant properties. Since hypertension and oxidative stress are key factors\
  \ for endothelial dysfunction, the main purpose of the present study was to investigate\
  \ the effect of FPH on vascular function. Participants consumed 5 g of FPH or a\
  \ placebo (PLA) supplement. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and tissue O2 saturation\
  \ (StO2) were taken at different time points over 130 min after nutritional intervention.\
  \ The FPH had 80.6 \xB1 1.0% of protein and the major amino acid present in the\
  \ FPH was glutamic acid, followed by aspartic acid and histidine. There was no significant\
  \ change in FMD as well as no significant change in the StO2 parameters between\
  \ FPH and PLA supplementation. Although FPH has been shown to be a valuable source\
  \ of protein, essential amino acids and antioxidants, a single dose did not promote\
  \ significant changes on vascular function in healthy individuals."
