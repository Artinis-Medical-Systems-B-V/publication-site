abstract: Purpose Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can be applied to assess skeletal
  muscle oxidative capacity (mV˙O2). Specific force (SF) and echo intensity (EI) represent
  muscle quality. However, it is unknown how exercise participation and biological
  sex impact mV˙O2, and if measures of muscle quality are related to mV˙O2. The aim
  was to assess training history- and biological sex-related differences in mV˙O2,
  SF, and EI in males and females. Methods To determine training history, 50 adults
  (23 females, 66% resistance trained, age:22 ± 3 years) completed strength and cardiorespiratory
  fitness assessments. Ultrasonography assessed muscle cross-sectional area (mCSA)
  and EI of the dominant vastus lateralis. The ratio of maximal strength to mCSA was
  defined as SF. To assess mV˙O2, participants cycled for 5 min at 50% of their peak
  power observed at maximal oxygen consumption. Following this, a mono-exponential
  decay curve, deriving the rate constant (k), was created from post-exercise NIRS
  recovery slopes. Separate 2(Sex) × 2(Training History) ANOVAs examined differences
  in k, SF, and EI. Pearson’s correlation coefficients evaluated relations among k,
  SF, and EI. Results There was a significant interaction for k (p = 0.025, ηp2=0.105),
  such that k was greater in aerobically trained adults. Additionally, SF was significantly
  greater for resistance trained individuals (p textless 0.001), whereas EI was not
  different between training history groups (p = 0.363). For the resistance trained
  group, SF and mV˙O2 were related (r = − 0.455, p = 0.002). EI was associated with
  mV˙O2 (r = 0.465, p = 0.006). Conclusion Chronic aerobic exercise promotes faster
  recovery following exercise bouts, whereas resistance training yields superior muscle
  quality, possibly demonstrating the consequences of a physiological trade-off and/or
  training-specificity.
