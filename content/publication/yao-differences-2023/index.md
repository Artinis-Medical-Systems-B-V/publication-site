abstract: Vascular impairment is closely related to increased mortality in chronic
  kidney disease (CKD). The objective of this study was to assess impairments in the
  regulation of peripheral microvascular perfusion in patients with CKD based on time-frequency
  spectral analysis of resting near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) signals. Total hemoglobin
  (tHb) concentration and tissue saturation index (TSI) signals were collected using
  NIRS for a continuous 5 mins at 10 Hz from the forearm of 55 participants (34 CKD
  including 5 with end-stage renal disease, and 21 age-matched control). Continuous
  wavelet transform-based spectral analysis was used to quantify the spectral amplitude
  within five pre-defined frequency intervals (I, 0.0095–0.021 Hz; II, 0.021–0.052 Hz;
  III, 0.052–0.145 Hz; IV, 0.145–0.6 Hz and V, 0.6–2.0 Hz), representing endothelial,
  neurogenic, myogenic, respiratory and heartbeat activity, respectively. CKD patients
  showed lower tHb average spectral amplitude within the neurogenic frequency interval
  compared with controls (p = 0.014), consistent with an increased sympathetic outflow
  observed in CKD. CKD patients also showed lower TSI average spectral amplitude within
  the endothelial frequency interval compared with controls (p = 0.046), consistent
  with a reduced endothelial function in CKD. These findings demonstrate the potential
  of wavelet analysis of NIRS to provide complementary information on peripheral microvascular
  regulation in CKD.
