 abstract = {Vascular impairment is closely related to increased mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The objective of this study was to assess impairments in the regulation of peripheral microvascular perfusion in patients with CKD based on time-frequency spectral analysis of resting near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) signals. Total hemoglobin (tHb) concentration and tissue saturation index (TSI) signals were collected using NIRS for a continuous 5 mins at 10 Hz from the forearm of 55 participants (34 CKD including 5 with end-stage renal disease, and 21 age-matched control). Continuous wavelet transform-based spectral analysis was used to quantify the spectral amplitude within five pre-defined frequency intervals (I, 0.0095–0.021 Hz; II, 0.021–0.052 Hz; III, 0.052–0.145 Hz; IV, 0.145–0.6 Hz and V, 0.6–2.0 Hz), representing endothelial, neurogenic, myogenic, respiratory and heartbeat activity, respectively. CKD patients showed lower tHb average spectral amplitude within the neurogenic frequency interval compared with controls (p = 0.014), consistent with an increased sympathetic outflow observed in CKD. CKD patients also showed lower TSI average spectral amplitude within the endothelial frequency interval compared with controls (p = 0.046), consistent with a reduced endothelial function in CKD. These findings demonstrate the potential of wavelet analysis of NIRS to provide complementary information on peripheral microvascular regulation in CKD.},
