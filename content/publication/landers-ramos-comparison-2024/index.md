abstract: 'Compared with younger adults, mitochondrial capacity and microvascular
  reperfusion of the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle are well maintained in similarly
  physically active middle-aged and older adults, with no sex differences observed
  in either outcome. However, greater tissue oxygen utilization in older adults during
  walking highlights how whole body functional movement may place an additional demand
  on the TA that reveals a potential compensatory response to lower functional reserve
  not evident in distinct measures of mitochondrial capacity and microvascular reperfusion.
  Optimal skeletal muscle oxidative function (microvascular reactivity and mitochondrial
  capacity) is an integral part of healthy aging and is related to physical function
  and quality of life. We aimed to extend upon the understanding of skeletal muscle
  oxidative function with healthy aging in males and females across the adult life
  span. Younger ( N = 22; 11 males), middle-aged ( N = 19; 10 males), and older (
  N = 21; 10 males) adults completed this study. Time spent in moderate and vigorous
  physical activity was self-reported and similar among groups. Near-infrared spectroscopy
  was used to investigate skeletal muscle microvascular reperfusion [oxyhemoglobin-myoglobin
  (O2Hb+Mb) half-time to peak hyperemia ( T½)], mitochondrial capacity [muscle oxygen
  consumption (mV̇o2) recovery rate constant], and walking tissue oxygen saturation
  ([Formula: see text]) of the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle at seven incremental
  walking speeds. Mitochondrial capacity was not significantly different across groups
  ( P = 0.07). Younger adults exhibited significantly slower T½ compared with older
  adults ( P = 0.006) and middle-aged adults ( P = 0.025). There were no observed
  sex differences for mitochondrial capacity ( P = 0.442) or T½ ( P = 0.402). Older
  adults exhibited significantly lower [Formula: see text] across all walking speeds
  compared with younger adults ( P = 0.003). Mitochondrial capacity and microvascular
  reperfusion are maintained in middle and older age, with no sex differences in either
  outcome. However, in older adults whole body functional movement, such as walking,
  may place an additional demand on the TA as a compensatory response to lower functional
  reserve not evident in distinct measures of mitochondrial capacity and microvascular
  reperfusion. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Compared with younger adults, mitochondrial capacity
  and microvascular reperfusion of the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle are well maintained
  in similarly physically active middle-aged and older adults, with no sex differences
  observed in either outcome. However, greater tissue oxygen utilization in older
  adults during walking highlights how whole body functional movement may place an
  additional demand on the TA that reveals a potential compensatory response to lower
  functional reserve not evident in distinct measures of mitochondrial capacity and
  microvascular reperfusion.'
