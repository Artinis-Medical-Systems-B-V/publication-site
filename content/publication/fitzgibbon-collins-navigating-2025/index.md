abstract: Monitoring middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv) during maneuvers
  known to alter cerebral perfusion, such as supine-to-standing transitions or walking,
  may provide a more comprehensive assessment used to flag individuals susceptible
  to cerebral hypoperfusion in a way that cannot be achieved at rest. Furthermore,
  dual-tasks challenge the brain to match MCAv to meet increases in local demands
  of oxygen and energy in two different functional networks (motor and cognitive),
  potentially causing cerebral hypoperfusion when competing for shared and/or limited
  brain resources. We developed a dual-task paradigm comprising of five levels of
  task complexity, including single-tasks and dual-tasks. The main objective of the
  study was to evaluate changes in MCAv as task complexity increased, which was demonstrated
  through cognitive, motor, and combined cognitive-motor tasks in older adults with
  different cognitive function levels. A secondary objective was to assess the success
  rate (as a percentage) of obtaining MCAv signals during the dual-task protocol to
  determine the feasibility of measuring such metrics in older adults with varying
  levels of cognitive ability. Of the 88 participants (37 females, 75 ± 7 years, 27 ± 4
  kg/m 2 ), a MCAv signal was ascertained in 56 participants throughout both single-tasks
  and both dual-tasks. MCAv increased when transitioning from a simple single-task
  to a more complex dual-task, while also highlighting a decline in motor and cognitive
  performance. A full multi-modal signal acquisition (MCAv, blood pressure, and cerebral
  oxygenation) was acquired for 48 participants. Lower MCAv signal acquisition was
  observed in females and people with cognitive impairment. We have demonstrated how
  MCAv changes with increased task complexity, while also uncovering declines in gait
  and cognitive performance. By establishing the feasibility of obtaining MCAv signals
  during cognitive stress tests and dynamic movements in older adults with varying
  cognitive abilities, we can begin to assess cerebral hypoperfusion using a potentially
  more sensitive indicator linked to neural damage.
