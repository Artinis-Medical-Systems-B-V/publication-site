abstract: Researchers have long observed distinct brain activity patterns in older
  adults compared with younger adults that correlate with cognitive performance. Mainly,
  older adults tend to show over-recruitment of bilateral brain regions during lower
  task loads and improved performance interpreted as compensation, but not observed
  at higher loads. However, there are discrepancies about whether increases in activity
  are compensatory and whether older adults can show compensation at higher loads.
  Our aim was to examine age-related differences in prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity
  and cognitive performance using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during
  single and dual N-back tasks. Twenty-seven young adults (18–27 years) and 31 older
  adults (64–84 yrs) took part in the study. We used a robust fNIRS data methodology
  consisting of channel and region of interest analyses. Results showed differences
  in performance between task load conditions and age-related differences in reaction
  times but no age-group effects for accuracy. Older adults exhibited more bilateral
  PFC activation compared with young adults across all tasks and showed increases
  in brain activity in high compared to low load conditions. Our findings further
  support previous reports showing that older adults use compensatory recruitment
  of additional brain regions in PFC to maintain cognitive performance but go against
  the notion that such compensation is not present at higher cognitive loads. Additionally,
  our results indicate that fNIRS is a sensitive tool that can characterize adaptive
  cortical changes in healthy aging.
