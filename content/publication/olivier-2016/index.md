abstract: "The purpose of the study was to determine muscle metabolism adaptation\
  \ to exercise in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy patients (FSHD) and to study\
  \ the correlation with clinical functional status (6-min walk test).8 FSHD patients\
  \ and 15 age-matched healthy controls (Controls) performed two isokinetic constant-load\
  \ knee extension exercises: (1) at 20% of their maximal extensors' peak torque (i.e.\
  \ the same relative workload) and (2) at (20Nm) (the same absolute workload) for\
  \ up to 4 min. All exercises consisted of rhythmic, voluntary, isokinetic, concentric\
  \ contractions of the quadriceps femoris at 90\xB0/s, whereas the flexion was performed\
  \ passively at the same speed. Muscle oxygenation in the vastus lateralis was evaluated\
  \ using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).The FSHD patients displayed a lower maximal\
  \ peak torque than controls (-41%, p < 0.05). During the two-exercise modalities,\
  \ deoxygenated haemoglobin (HHb) and total haemoglobin volume (tHb) were lower in\
  \ the FSHD patients (p < 0.05). The initial muscle deoxygenation time delay was\
  \ shorter in the control group (FSHD: 15.1 \xB1 4.1 s vs. controls: 10.4 \xB1 2.1\
  \ s, p < 0.05). Mean response time and maximal peak torque were both correlated\
  \ with functional impairment (walking endurance).The results suggest that FSHD patients\
  \ present an impairment in their capacity to deliver or to use oxygen."
