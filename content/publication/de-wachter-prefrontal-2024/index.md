abstract: Mental fatigue (MF) and hypoxia impair cognitive performance through changes
  in brain hemodynamics. We want to elucidate the role of prefrontal cortex (PFC)-oxygenation
  in MF. Twelve participants (22.9 ± 3.5 years) completed four experimental trials,
  (1) MF in (normobaric) hypoxia (MF_HYP) (3.800 m; 13.5%O2), (2) MF in normoxia (MF_NOR)
  (98 m; 21.0%O2), (3) Control task in HYP (CON_HYP), (4) Control in NOR (CON_NOR).
  Participants performed a 2-back task, Digit Symbol Substitution test and Psychomotor
  Vigilance task before and after a 60-min Stroop task or an emotionally neutral documentary.
  Brain oxygenation was measured through functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy. Subjective
  feelings of MF and physiological measures (heart rate, oxygen saturation, blood
  glucose and hemoglobin) were recorded. The Stroop task resulted in increased subjective
  feelings of MF compared to watching the documentary. 2-back accuracy was lower post
  task compared to pre task in MF_NOR and CON_NOR, while no differences were found
  in the other cognitive tasks. The fraction of inspired oxygen did not impact feelings
  of MF. Although performing the Stroop resulted in higher subjective feelings of
  MF, hypoxia had no effect on the severity of self-reported MF. Additionally, this
  study could not provide evidence for a role of oxygenation of the PFC in the build-up
  of MF.
