abstract: 'Background: Maladaptive neuroplasticity-related learned response in substance
  use disorder (SUD) can be ameliorated using noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS);
  however, inter-individual variability needs to be addressed for clinical translation.
  Objective: Our first objective was to develop a hypothesis for NIBS for learned
  response in SUD based on a competing neurobehavioral decision systems model. The
  next objective was to develop the theory by conducting a computational simulation
  of NIBS of the cortico-cerebello-thalamo-cortical (CCTC) loop in cannabis use disorder
  (CUD)-related dysfunctional “cue-reactivity”—a construct closely related to “craving”—that
  is a core symptom. Our third objective was to test the feasibility of a neuroimaging-guided
  rational NIBS approach in healthy humans. Methods: “Cue-reactivity” can be measured
  using behavioral paradigms and portable neuroimaging, including functional near-infrared
  spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalogram (EEG) metrics of sensorimotor gating.
  Therefore, we conducted a computational simulation of NIBS, including transcranial
  direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation
  (tACS) of the cerebellar cortex and deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) of the CCTC loop
  for its postulated effects on fNIRS and EEG metrics. We also developed a rational
  neuroimaging-guided NIBS approach for the cerebellar lobule (VII) and prefrontal
  cortex based on a healthy human study. Results: Simulation of cerebellar tDCS induced
  gamma oscillations in the cerebral cortex, while transcranial temporal interference
  stimulation induced a gamma-to-beta frequency shift. A preliminary healthy human
  study (N = 10) found that 2 mA cerebellar tDCS evoked similar oxyhemoglobin (HbO)
  response in the range of 5 × 10−6 M across the cerebellum and PFC brain regions
  (α = 0.01); however, infra-slow (0.01–0.10 Hz) prefrontal cortex HbO-driven phase–amplitude-coupled
  (PAC; 4 Hz, ±2 mA (max)) cerebellar tACS evoked HbO levels in the range of 10−7
  M that were statistically different (α = 0.01) across these brain regions. Conclusion:
  Our healthy human study showed the feasibility of fNIRS of cerebellum and PFC and
  closed-loop fNIRS-driven ctACS at 4 Hz, which may facilitate cerebellar cognitive
  function via the frontoparietal network. Future work needs to combine fNIRS with
  EEG for multi-modal imaging for closed-loop NIBS during operant conditioning.'
