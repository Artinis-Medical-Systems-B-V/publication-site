 abstract = {This scoping review analyzes the use of Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) in game-based learning (GBL) settings, providing a thorough examination of contemporary trends and approaches.Employing the PRISMA framework, an initial collection of 956 articles was methodically screened, resulting in 18 research papers that satisfied the inclusion criteria. Each chosen study was assessed based on many criteria, including measurable outcomes, equipment characteristics, and study design. The review categorizes fNIRS-based GBL research into two primary types: cognitive response studies, which analyze how the brain function during tasks and comparative studies, which evaluate finding across different study materials or methods based on neural activities. The analysis includes learning platforms, gaming devices, and various fNIRS devices that has been used. Additionally, study designs and data collection methodologies were reviewed to evaluate their impact on research results. A comprehensive analysis outlines the specifications of fNIRS devices used in diverse studies, including yearly publication trends categorized by learning type, gaming equipment, fNIRS study classification, and outcome measures such as learning improvements and cerebral pattern analysis. Furthermore, the study design and analysis techniques are detailed alongside the number of studies in each category, emphasizing methodological trends and analytical strategies.},
