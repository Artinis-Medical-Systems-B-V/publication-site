abstract: 'Purpose: Post-exercise passive heating has been reported to augment adaptations
  associated with endurance training. The current study evaluated the effect of a
  4-week remotely administered, post-exercise passive leg heating protocol, using
  an electrically heated layering ensemble, on determinants of endurance performance.
  Methods: Thirty recreationally trained participants were randomly allocated to either
  a post-exercise passive leg heating (PAH, n = 16) or unsupervised training only
  control group (CON, n = 14). The PAH group wore the passive heating ensemble for
  90–120 min/day, completing a total of 20 (16 post-exercise and 4 stand-alone leg
  heating) sessions across 4 weeks. Whole-body (peak oxygen uptake, gas exchange threshold,
  gross efficiency and pulmonary oxygen uptake kinetics), single-leg exercise (critical
  torque and NIRS-derived muscle oxygenation), resting vascular characteristics (flow-mediated
  dilation) and angiogenic blood measures (nitrate, vascular endothelial growth factor
  and hypoxia inducible factor 1−α) were recorded to characterize the endurance phenotype.
  All measures were assessed before (PRE), at 2 weeks (MID) and after (POST) the intervention.
  Results: There was no effect of the intervention on test of whole-body endurance
  capacity, vascular function or blood markers (p textgreater 0.05). However, oxygen
  kinetics were adversely affected by PAH, denoted by a slowing of the phase II time
  constant; τ (p = 0.02). Furthermore, critical torque–deoxygenation ratio was improved
  in CON relative to PAH (p = 0.03). Conclusion: We have demonstrated that PAH had
  no ergogenic benefit but instead elicited some unfavourable effects on sub-maximal
  exercise characteristics in recreationally trained individuals.'
