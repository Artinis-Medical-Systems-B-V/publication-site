 abstract = {Purpose: Post-exercise passive heating has been reported to augment adaptations associated with endurance training. The current study evaluated the effect of a 4-week remotely administered, post-exercise passive leg heating protocol, using an electrically heated layering ensemble, on determinants of endurance performance. Methods: Thirty recreationally trained participants were randomly allocated to either a post-exercise passive leg heating (PAH, n = 16) or unsupervised training only control group (CON, n = 14). The PAH group wore the passive heating ensemble for 90–120 min/day, completing a total of 20 (16 post-exercise and 4 stand-alone leg heating) sessions across 4 weeks. Whole-body (peak oxygen uptake, gas exchange threshold, gross efficiency and pulmonary oxygen uptake kinetics), single-leg exercise (critical torque and NIRS-derived muscle oxygenation), resting vascular characteristics (flow-mediated dilation) and angiogenic blood measures (nitrate, vascular endothelial growth factor and hypoxia inducible factor 1−α) were recorded to characterize the endurance phenotype. All measures were assessed before (PRE), at 2 weeks (MID) and after (POST) the intervention. Results: There was no effect of the intervention on test of whole-body endurance capacity, vascular function or blood markers (p \textgreater 0.05). However, oxygen kinetics were adversely affected by PAH, denoted by a slowing of the phase II time constant; τ (p = 0.02). Furthermore, critical torque–deoxygenation ratio was improved in CON relative to PAH (p = 0.03). Conclusion: We have demonstrated that PAH had no ergogenic benefit but instead elicited some unfavourable effects on sub-maximal exercise characteristics in recreationally trained individuals.},
