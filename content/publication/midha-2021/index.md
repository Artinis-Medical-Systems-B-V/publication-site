abstract: The motivation behind using physiological measures to estimate cognitive
  activity is typically to build technology that can help people to understand themselves
  and their work, or indeed for systems to do so and adapt. While functional Near
  Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) has been shown to reliably reflect manipulations of
  mental workload in different work tasks, we still need to establish whether fNIRS
  can differentiate variety within common office-like tasks in order to broaden our
  understanding of the factors involved in tracking them in real working conditions.
  20 healthy participants (8 females, 12 males), whose work included office-like tasks,
  took part in a user study that investigated a) the sensitivity of fNIRS for measuring
  mental workload variations in representations of everyday reading and writing tasks,
  and b) how representations of natural interruptions are reflected in the data. Results
  supported fNIRS measuring PFC activation in differentiating between workload levels
  for reading tasks but not writing tasks in terms of increased oxygenated haemoglobin
  (O2Hb) and decreased deoxygenated haemoglobin (HHb), for harder conditions compared
  to easier conditions. There was considerable support for fNIRS in detecting changes
  in workload levels due to interruptions. Variations in workload levels during the
  interruptions could be understood in relation to spare capacity models. These findings
  may guide future work into sustained monitoring of cognitive activity in real-world
  settings.
