abstract: "Sufficient O2-supply to the brain is necessary for an adequate cerebral\
  \ energy metabolism, function and growth. To elucidate the relation between changes\
  \ in, respectively, mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and cerebral O2-supply and\
  \ changes in the oxygenation state of hemoglobin during hypotension in preterm born\
  \ lambs. Preterm lambs were delivered at 141 days (n=7) or 127 days (n=7) of gestation.\
  \ Hypotension was induced by stepwise withdrawal of blood. Cerebral arterial blood\
  \ gases were analyzed at the end of each level to calculate cerebral O2-supply.\
  \ Near-infrared spectroscopy was used to measure changes in the concentration of\
  \ cerebral oxyhemoglobin (cO2Hb), deoxyhemoglobin (cHHb) and cHbD (the difference\
  \ between cO2Hb and cHHb). In the 141 and the 127 d lambs, changes in MABP and cerebral\
  \ O2-supply were positively linearly related with $\u0394$cO2Hb, and negatively\
  \ with $\u0394$cHHb. MABP was positively linearly related with changes in cHbD.\
  \ During hemorrhagic hypotension, changes in MABP and cerebral O2-supply are reflected\
  \ by changes in the oxygenation state of cerebral hemoglobin in near-term born lambs."
