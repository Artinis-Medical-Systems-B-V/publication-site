abstract: Abstract  The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of acute
  normobaric (NH, decreased FiO 2 ) and hypobaric (HH, 4200 m ascent) hypoxia exposures
  compared to sea level (normobaric normoxia, NN). Tissue oxygenation, cardiovascular,
  and body fluid variables measured during rest and a 3-min step-test following 90-min
  exposures (NH, HH, NN). Muscle oxygenated hemoglobin (O 2 Hb) decreased, and muscle
  deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb) increased environmentally independent from rest to
  exercise ( p textless 0.001). During exercise, brain O 2 Hb was lower at HH compared
  to NN ( p = 0.007), trending similarly with NH ( p = 0.066), but no difference between
  NN and NH ( p = 0.158). During exercise, HR at NH (141 ± 4 beats·min −1 ) and HH
  (141 ± 3 beats·min −1 ) were higher than NN (127 ± 44 beats·min −1 , p = 0.002),
  but not each other ( p = 0.208). During exercise, stroke volume at HH (109.6 ± 4.1 mL·beat
  −1 ) was higher than NH (97.8 ± 3.3 mL·beat −1 ) and NN (99.8 ± 3.9 mL·beat −1 ,
  p ≤ 0.010) with no difference between NH and NN ( p = 0.481). During exercise, cardiac
  output at NH (13.8 ± 0.6 L) and HH (15.5 ± 0.7 L) were higher than NN (12.6 ± 0.5
  L, p ≤ 0.006) with HH also higher than NH ( p = 0.001). During acute hypoxic stimuli,
  skeletal muscle maintains oxygenation whereas the brain does not. These differences
  may be mediated by environmentally specific cardiovascular compensation. Thus, caution
  is advised when equating NH and HH.
