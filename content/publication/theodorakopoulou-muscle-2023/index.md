abstract: 'Rationale & objective: Previous studies in chronic kidney disease (CKD)
  showed that vascular dysfunction in different circulatory beds progressively deteriorates
  with worsening CKD severity. This study evaluated muscle oxygenation and microvascular
  reactivity at rest, during an occlusion-reperfusion maneuver, and during exercise
  in patients with different stages of CKD versus controls.  Study design: Observational
  controlled study.  Setting & participants: 90 participants (18 per CKD stage 2,
  3a, 3b, 4, and 18 controls).  Predictor: CKD stage.  Outcomes: Primary, muscle oxygenation
  at rest; secondary, muscle oxygenation during occlusion-reperfusion and exercise,
  and muscle microvascular reactivity (hyperemic response).  Analytical approach:
  Continuous measurement of muscle oxygenation [tissue saturation index (TSI%)] using
  near-infrared-spectroscopy at rest, during occlusion-reperfusion, and during a 3-min
  handgrip exercise (at 35% of maximal-voluntary-contraction). Aortic pulse-wave-velocity
  (PWV) and carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) were also recorded.  Results: Resting
  muscle oxygenation did not differ across the study groups (controls: 64.3±2.9 stage-2:
  63.8±4.2 stage-3a: 64.1±4.1 stage-3b: 62.3±3.3 stage-4: 62.7±4.3%; p=0.6). During
  occlusion, no significant differences among groups were detected in TSIocl magnitude-
  and occlusion-slope. However, during reperfusion, the TSImax and the hyperemic response
  were significantly lower in groups of patients with more advanced CKD stages compared
  to controls (controls: 11.2±3.7 stage-2: 8.3±4.6 stage-3: 7.8±5.5 stage-3b: 7.3±4.4
  stage-4: 7.2±3.3; p=0.04). During handgrip exercise, muscle oxygenation (TSIaverage-decline)
  was marginally lower in patients with CKD than controls, but no significant differences
  were detected across CKD stages.  Limitations: Moderate sample size, cross-sectional
  evaluation.  Conclusions: Although no differences were observed in muscle oxygenation
  at rest or during occlusion, the microvascular hyperemic response during reperfusion
  was significantly impaired in CKD and was most prominent in more advanced CKD stages.
  This impaired ability of microvasculature to respond to stimuli may be a crucial
  component of the adverse vascular profile of patients with CKD and may contribute
  to exercise intolerance.'
