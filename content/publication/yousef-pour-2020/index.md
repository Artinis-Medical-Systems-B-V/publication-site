abstract: 'Background: The Stroop test is a well-known model to denote the decline
  in performance under the incongruent condition, which requires selective attention
  and control of competitive responses. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy can
  identify activated brain regions associated with the Stroop interference effect.
  Objective: This research aims to identify the neural correlates associated with
  the Stroop tasks within the brain activated regions. Materials and Methods: In this
  cross sectional study, twelve right-handed healthy controls were investigated by
  means of a multi-channels fNIRS unit during the execution of the Stroop test. Effective
  connectivity changes in the prefrontal cortex between Stroop attentional conflict
  and rest states were calculated using DCM approach to investigate (1) areas known
  for selective attention and (2) analyze internetwork functional connectivity strength
  (FCS) by selecting several brain functional networks. Results: The results indicated
  that an increased activity was recorded in the LDLPFC during incongruent condition,
  while under neutral condition, the increase in activity was even more pronounced
  in those areas. Effect of Stroop interference associated with significant consistent
  causes an increase in the RDLPFC to DMPFC, LDLPFC to DMPFC and LDLPFC to RPFC effective
  connectivity strengths. Conclusion: This study showed the use of DCM algorithm for
  fNIRS data with respect to fMRI has provided additional information about the directional
  connectivity and causal interactions in LPFC networks during a conflict processing.
  Eventually, high temporal resolution fNIRS can be a promising tool for monitoring
  functional brain activation under the cognitive paradigms in neurological research
  and psychotherapy applications.'
