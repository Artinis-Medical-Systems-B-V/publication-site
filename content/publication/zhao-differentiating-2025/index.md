abstract: Ensuring safety in next-generation intelligent cockpits demands accurate
  assessment of pilot states, particularly distinguishing between eustress and distress.
  Traditional stress monitoring lacks this nuance and struggles across varying flight
  tasks. This study proposes a multimodal neuro-cardiac framework combining functional
  near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electrocardiography (ECG) to differentiate
  eustress and distress across tasks. Physiological data were collected from 35 participants
  under simulated flight missions inducing both stress types. Eleven features showing
  significant differentiation were identified and used to train classification models
  with machine learning algorithms. The model achieved 83.04% accuracy across tasks,
  and up to 90.83% within single tasks. These findings demonstrate the robustness
  of fNIRS-ECG-based monitoring in pilot stress classification. The proposed method
  offers objective biomarkers critical for adaptive intelligent cockpit systems, contributing
  directly to flight safety and human-machine interaction optimisation.
