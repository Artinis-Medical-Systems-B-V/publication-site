abstract: 'Background/Objectives: Lightweight and portable functional near-infrared
  spectroscopy (fNIRS) systems enable neuromonitoring in clinical environments such
  as operating rooms. Patient posture is known to influence physiology, behavior,
  and brain activity, and may affect fNIRS measurements. However, the effects of some
  postures commonly used in clinical care—such as Fowler’s and semi-Fowler’s—remain
  largely unexamined in fNIRS research. Methods: We conducted a singular study in
  a mock operating room exploring the effects of five postures—standing, upright sitting,
  Fowler’s, semi-Fowler’s, and supine—on fNIRS data during resting-state conditions
  and under various auditory stimuli. We collected hemodynamic data and extracted
  the characteristic hemodynamic response function (HRF) at each posture in response
  to the presented auditory stimulus and the amplitude of the resting-state signal.
  Results: For the auditory task condition, we found that posture had no statistically
  significant impact on the amplitude of the global HRF for Fowler’s and semi-Fowler’s
  postures. We also found no significant relationships across different postures when
  analyzing the amplitude of the global resting-state signal; however, binning of
  frequency-dependent postural effects revealed statistically significant differences
  between Fowler’s and semi-Fowler’s postures at low frequencies (f textless 0.09
  Hz). Conclusions: Our results suggest posture effects need not require complex data
  processing pipelines or data segmentation efforts on an auditory task-induced condition
  or on the general analysis of the global resting signal; however, not all reclined
  postures are equivalent, and we recommend that researchers report the angle of reclination
  measurements for seated data collection sessions for improved reliability and data
  context.'
