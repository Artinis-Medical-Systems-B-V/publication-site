abstract: Introduction The clock drawing test (CDT) is a neuropsychological test for
  the screening of global cognitive functioning. The test requires use of multiple
  cognitive domains including executive functions, visuospatial abilities and semantic
  memory and can be a suitable tool for screening cognitive decline in participants
  in the early stages of Parkinson's Disease (PD). Behavioral performance on the CDT
  has been studied in depth, however, neural activation during real-time performance
  has not been extensively investigated. In this study we explored changes in prefrontal
  cortex (PFC) activation during the performance of CDT in participants with PD compared
  to healthy controls (HC) and assessed the correlations between PFC activation and
  CDT performance.  Methods The study included 60 participants, 29 PD and 31 HC participants
  whom performed a digital CDT (DCTclock) in conjunction with a Functional Near-Infrared
  Spectroscopy (fNIRS) system measuring neural activation in the PFC.  Results HbO2
  signals derived from the fNIRS during the CDT revealed that PD participants showed
  more moderate slopes than the HC in the right hemisphere in the command (p = 0.042)
  and copy task (p = 0.009). Better score on the measurement of information processing
  correlated with steeper right hemisphere HbO2 slope in the copy task in the PD group
  (p = 0.003).  Conclusion Our results reflect slower PFC activation in participants
  with PD which correlates with behavioral measures. In addition, the findings of
  the study indicate the importance of performing the CDT copy task condition that
  detect early cognitive decline in participants with PD.
