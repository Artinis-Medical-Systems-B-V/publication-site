abstract: Depression is a common mental disorder that seriously affects patients’
  social function and daily life. Its accurate diagnosis remains a big challenge in
  depression treatment. In this study, we used electroencephalography (EEG) and functional
  near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and measured the whole brain EEG signals and
  forehead hemodynamic signals from 25 depression patients and 30 healthy subjects
  during the resting state. On one hand, we explored the EEG brain functional network
  properties, and found that the clustering coefficient and local efficiency of the
  delta and theta bands in patients were significantly higher than those in normal
  subjects. On the other hand, we extracted brain network properties, asymmetry, and
  brain oxygen entropy as alternative features, used a data-driven automated method
  to select features, and established a support vector machine model for automatic
  depression classification. The results showed the classification accuracy was 81.8%
  when using EEG features alone and increased to 92.7% when using hybrid EEG and fNIRS
  features. The brain network local efficiency in the delta band, hemispheric asymmetry
  in the theta band and brain oxygen sample entropy features differed significantly
  between the two groups (p&lt; 0.05) and showed high depression distinguishing ability
  indicating that they may be effective biological markers for identifying depression.
  EEG, fNIRS and machine learning constitute an effective method for classifying depression
  at the individual level.
