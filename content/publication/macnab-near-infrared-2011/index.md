abstract: ' We describe innovative methodology for monitoring alterations in bladder
  oxygenation and haemodynamics in humans using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).
  Concentrations of the chromophores oxygenated (O 2 Hb) and deoxygenated (HHb) haemoglobin
  and their sum (total haemoglobin) differ during bladder contraction in health and
  disease. A wireless device that incorporates three paired light emitting diodes
  (wavelengths 760 and 850 nanometers) and silicon photodiode detector collects data
  transcutaneously (10 Hz) with the emitter/detector over the bladder during spontaneous
  bladder emptying. Data analysis indicates comparable patterns of change in chromophore
  concentration in healthy children and adults (positive trend during voiding, predominantly
  due to elevated O 2 Hb), but different changes in symptomatic subjects with characteristic
  chromophore patterns identified for voiding dysfunction due to specific pathophysiologies:
  bladder outlet obstruction (males), overactive bladder (females), and nonneurogenic
  dysfunction (children). Comparison with NIRS muscle data suggests altered bladder
  haemodynamics and/or oxygenation may underlie voiding dysfunction offering new insight
  into the causal physiology. '
