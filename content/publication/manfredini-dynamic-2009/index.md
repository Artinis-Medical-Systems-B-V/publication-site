abstract: "Objectives: Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS), suitable for dynamic measurements,\
  \ is not routinely used for peripheral arterial disease (PAD). We propose a dynamic\
  \ NIRS-based measurement to quantify variations in muscle metabolism in PAD. Method:\
  \ Sixty-seven consecutive PAD patients (males = 56, age 71.6 \xB1 8.7 years) and\
  \ 28 healthy subjects (males = 12, age 30.4 \xB1 11.9 years) were studied. An echo-colour\
  \ Doppler (ECD) was performed and the ankle-brachial index (ABI) was calculated.\
  \ Participants performed an incremental treadmill test with NIRS probes on the gastrocnemius.\
  \ Variations in oxygenated (HbO2), deoxygenated (HHb), total (tHb = HbO2 + HHb),\
  \ and differential (dHb = HbO2 - HHb) haemoglobin were recorded and quantified as\
  \ area-under-curve (AUC) within the range 1.7-3.0 km h-1. Heart rate was recorded,\
  \ and the number of beats in the same interval was calculated (dHr). Results: O2HbAUC,\
  \ HHbAUC and dHbAUC differed between diseased and non-diseased legs (P < 0.0001)\
  \ and exhibited different patterns related to PAD severity according to the ABI\
  \ value. A compensatory heart rate increase was observed in PAD patients. Compared\
  \ with the ECD positivity for occlusions/stenoses or multiple plaques, only the\
  \ receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of dHbAUC (area = 0.932, P <\
  \ 0.0001) showed a sensitivity/specificity of 87.6/93.4 for values \u2264-197 (LR\
  \ + LR-: 13.36/0.13). Conclusion: The dynamic NIRS-based test, quantifying muscle\
  \ metabolic response according to presence and degree of PAD, allows the evaluation\
  \ of patients with walking disabilities. \xA9 2009 European Society for Vascular\
