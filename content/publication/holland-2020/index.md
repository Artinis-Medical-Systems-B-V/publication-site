abstract: "Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an\
  \ important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule\
  \ and protein\u2212protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible\
  \ ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\u03B1$-helical peptides and\
  \ systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for\
  \ flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing\
  \ with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD\
  \ among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD \u2264 2.0\
  \ \xC5 for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP\
  \ settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the\
  \ case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy\
  \ of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19\
  \ peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a\
  \ subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that\
  \ case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find\
  \ that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides\
  \ of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability\
  \ for this approach."
