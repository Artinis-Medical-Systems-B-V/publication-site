abstract: "Objectives Repetitive strain injury [RSI] is a multi-factorial overuse\
  \ syndrome that has been associated with local vascular and muscular impairments.\
  \ Recently, we found vascular changes also in the non-affected site, which is suggestive\
  \ for systemic changes in RSI. Whether RSI is associated with systemic changes in\
  \ muscle function is unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine muscular\
  \ function in the lower limb of patient with upper limb RSI.Methods Ten patients\
  \ with RSI [including complaints in the forearm] and 10 healthy normal control subjects\
  \ participated in the study. Local oxygen consumption of the forearm muscles was\
  \ examined at baseline and after exercise using near-infrared spectroscopy. Quadriceps\
  \ muscle contractile properties were examined using isometric contractions and electrical\
  \ stimulations.Results Patients with RSI demonstrated a lower oxygen consumption\
  \ in the forearm muscles after exercise [P0.05], indicative for localized muscular\
  \ changes, and a leftward shifted force frequency relationship [analysis of variance,\
  \ group-effect: P0.02] in the quadriceps muscle. These contractile properties point\
  \ in the direction of a larger amount of type II fibers in the quadriceps muscle\
  \ of patients with RSI.Conclusions These findings suggest that the unaffected quadriceps\
  \ muscles of patients with upper limb RSI probably demonstrate a predominance for\
  \ type II fibers. Whether this reflects a systemic predisposition for subjects to\
  \ be prone to develop RSI has to be elucidated. \xA9 2012 Informa Healthcare USA,\
