abstract: "Abstract: Rock-climbing performance is largely dependent on the endurance\
  \ of the forearm flexors. Recently, it was reported that forearm flexor endurance\
  \ in elite climbers is independent of the ability to regulate conduit artery (brachial)\
  \ blood flow, suggesting that endurance is not primarily dependent on the ability\
  \ of the brachial artery to deliver oxygen, but rather the ability of the muscle\
  \ to perfuse and use oxygen, i.e., skeletal muscle oxidative capacity. Purpose:\
  \ The aim of the study was to determine whether an index of oxidative capacity in\
  \ the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) predicts the best sport climbing red-point\
  \ grade within the last 6\_months. Participants consisted of 46 sport climbers with\
  \ a range of abilities. Methods: Using near-infrared spectroscopy, the oxidative\
  \ capacity index of the FDP was assessed by calculating the half-time for tissue\
  \ oxygen resaturation (O2HTR) following 3\u20135\_min of ischemia. Results: Linear\
  \ regression, adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and training experience, revealed a 1-s\
  \ decrease in O2HTR was associated with an increase in red-point grade by 0.65 (95\_\
  % CI 0.35\u20130.94, Adj R2\_=\_0.53). Conclusions: Considering a grade of 0.4 separated\
  \ the top four competitors in the 2015 International Federation Sport Climbing World\
  \ Cup, this finding suggests that forearm flexor oxidative capacity index is an\
  \ important determinant of rock-climbing performance."
