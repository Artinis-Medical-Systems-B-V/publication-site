abstract: 'Aims Cerebral hypoperfusion is implicated in the pathogenesis of associations
  between orthostatic hypotension and adverse outcome such as falls, cognitive impairment,
  depression, and mortality. Although the blood pressure response to orthostasis has
  been well studied there is a lack of information on orthostatic cerebrovascular
  responses in older populations.  Methods and results We measured cerebral hemodynamics,
  utilizing near infrared spectroscopy, coupled with peripheral blood pressure during
  an active stand in a large population of well-phenotyped older adults (N = 2764).
  Multi-level mixed effect models were utilized to investigate associations with age
  and sex, as well as confounders including anti-hypertensive medications. Normative
  cerebral oxygenation responses were also modelled utilizing generalized additive
  models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS). Older age groups experienced larger
  initial drops in oxygenation and a slower recovery, and responses also differed
  by sex. The drop after standing ranged from −1.85 % (95 % confidence interval (CI):
  −2.02 to −1.68) in the males aged 54–59 years vs −1.15 % (95 % CI: −1.31 to −1.00)
  in females aged 54–59 years, to −2.67 % (95 % CI: −3.01 to −2.33) in males aged
  ≥ 80 years vs −1.97 % (95 % CI: −2.32 to −1.62) females aged ≥ 80 years. Reduced
  oxygenation levels were also evident in those taking anti-hypertensive medications.  Conclusion
  Cerebral autoregulation is impaired with age, particularly in older women and those
  taking anti-hypertensives. SBP during the stand explained some of the age gradient
  in the late recovery stage of the stand for the oldest age group. Reported orthostatic
  symptoms did not correlate with hypoperfusion. Therefore, measures of orthostatic
  cerebral flow should be assessed in addition to peripheral BP in older patients
  irrespective of symptoms. Further studies are required to investigate the relationship
  between NIRS measurements and clinical outcomes such as falls, cognitive impairment
  and depression.'
