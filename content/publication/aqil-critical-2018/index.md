abstract: The robust characterization of real-time brain activity carries potential
  for many applications. However, the contamination of measured signals by various
  instrumental, environmental, and physiological sources of noise introduces a substantial
  amount of signal variance and, consequently, challenges real-time estimation of
  contributions from underlying neuronal sources. Functional near infra-red spectroscopy
  (fNIRS) is an emerging imaging modality whose real-time potential is yet to be fully
  explored. The objectives of the current study are to (i) validate a time-dependent
  linear model of hemodynamic responses in fNIRS, and (ii) test the robustness of
  this approach against measurement noise (instrumental and physiological) and mis-specification
  of the hemodynamic response basis functions (amplitude, latency, and duration).
  We propose a linear hemodynamic model with time-varying parameters, which are estimated
  (adapted and tracked) using a dynamic recursive least square algorithm. Owing to
  the linear nature of the activation model, the problem of achieving robust convergence
  to an accurate estimation of the model parameters is recast as a problem of parameter
  error stability around the origin. We show that robust convergence of the proposed
  method is guaranteed in the presence of an acceptable degree of model misspecification
  and we derive an upper bound on noise under which reliable parameters can still
  be inferred. We also derived a lower bound on signal-to-noise-ratio over which the
  reliable parameters can still be inferred from a channel/voxel. Whilst here applied
  to fNIRS, the proposed methodology is applicable to other hemodynamic-based imaging
  technologies such as functional magnetic resonance imaging.
