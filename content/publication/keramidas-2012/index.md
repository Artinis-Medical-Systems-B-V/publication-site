abstract: "Aim: To investigate the effect of carbon monoxide (CO) in the inspired\
  \ air as anticipated during peak hours of traffic in polluted megalopolises on cerebral,\
  \ respiratory and leg muscle oxygenation during a constant-power test (CPT). In\
  \ addition, since O 2 breathing is used to hasten elimination of CO from the blood,\
  \ we examined the effect of breathing O 2 following exposure to CO on cerebral and\
  \ muscle oxygenation during a subsequent exercise test under CO conditions. Methods:\
  \ Nine men participated in three trials: (i) 3-h air exposure followed by a control\
  \ CPT, (ii) 1-h air and 2-h CO (18.9ppm) exposure succeeded by a CPT under CO conditions\
  \ (CPT COA), and (iii) 2-h CO and 1-h 100% normobaric O 2 exposure followed by a\
  \ CPT under CO conditions (CPT COB). All exercise tests were performed at 85% of\
  \ peak power output to exhaustion. Oxygenated ($\u0394$[O 2Hb]), deoxygenated ($\u0394\
  $[HHb]) and total ($\u0394$[tHb]) haemoglobin in cerebral, intercostal and vastus\
  \ lateralis muscles were monitored with near-infrared spectroscopy throughout the\
  \ CPTs. Results: Performance time did not vary between trials. However, the vastus\
  \ lateralis and intercostal $\u0394$[O 2Hb] and $\u0394$[tHb] were lower in CPT\
  \ COA than in CPT. During the CPT COB, the intercostal $\u0394$[O 2Hb] and $\u0394\
  $[tHb] were higher than in the CPT COA. There were no differences in cerebral oxygenation\
  \ between the trials. Conclusion: Inspiration of 18.9ppm CO decreases oxygenation\
  \ in the vastus lateralis and serratus anterior muscles, but does not affect performance.\
  \ Breathing normobaric O 2 moderates the CO-induced reductions in muscle oxygenation,\
  \ mainly in the intercostals, but does not affect endurance. \xA9 2011 The Authors.\
