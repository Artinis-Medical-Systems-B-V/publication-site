abstract: "We tested the hypothesis that transcranial oximetry by fast scanning near\
  \ infrared spectroscopy can detect local desaturation of hemoglobin in arterial\
  \ vessels of cerebral circulation with impaired blood supply. A total of 74 near\
  \ infrared spectroscopy recordings were taken from the intact skull of humans. Perfusion\
  \ of the hemisphere under the detector was assessed in one of four groups: (1) healthy\
  \ volunteer; (2) patient, unaffected side; (3) patient, affected side with intact\
  \ collateral blood supply; (4) patient, affected side, impaired collateral blood\
  \ supply. Transcranial saturation was 0.90\xB10.01 (all values reported as mean\xB1\
  S.E.) in healthy volunteers (n=24), 0.92\xB10.008 in the unaffected hemisphere of\
  \ patients (n=23), 0.92\xB10.001 in the affected side if collateral supply with\
  \ blood was intact (n=16). There was no statistical significance between these groups.\
  \ Saturation in affected hemispheres with impaired collateral blood supply (n=9)\
  \ was 0.81\xB10.028, which was significantly different from all other groups (P<0.05,\
  \ one way-ANOVA). We conclude, that transcranial pulse oximetry can detect local\
  \ hypoxia if collateral blood supply fails. \xA9 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All\
