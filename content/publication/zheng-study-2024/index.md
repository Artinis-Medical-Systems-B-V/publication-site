abstract: 'Background The rise in the number of children diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity
  disorder (ADHD) highlights the need for effective interventions targeting attentional
  control. Although recent research has demonstrated the potential of neurofeedback
  training (NFT) for children with ADHD, most studies have been conducted in laboratory
  settings, raising questions about their real-world applicability. To address this
  issue, virtual reality (VR) may offer a solution to the ecological validity challenges
  encountered in NFT. By coupling NFT with VR, individuals can engage in self-regulating
  brain activity within a simulated, realistic environment. This study aims to investigate
  the efficacy of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-based NFT combined with VR in
  alleviating ADHD symptoms among children, addressing the need for interventions
  with practical relevance and effectiveness. Methods This study aims to recruit 138
  children aged 7–12 diagnosed with ADHD. Following baseline assessment, participants
  will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) NIRS-based NFT in a VR
  classroom setting; (2) conventional computerised cognitive training (active control)
  or (3) a waitlist control group. On completion of intervention sessions in the two
  training groups, all groups will undergo an assessment at time 2, with a follow-up
  assessment scheduled 2 months post-training for all participants. Primary outcomes
  will include measures of executive function, such as attentional control, response
  inhibition and working memory, along with changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated
  haemoglobin levels monitored by functional NIRS. Secondary outcome measures will
  comprise ratings of children’s ADHD symptoms and executive function behaviours in
  daily life, reported by parents and teachers. Discussion The three-arm randomised
  controlled trial will address research gaps regarding the effectiveness of NIRS-based
  NFT for children with ADHD, particularly when integrated with immersive VR technology.
  By combining NFT and VR, this study aims to simulate a real-world environment, potentially
  amplifying intervention effects. The findings from the study will provide evidence
  for the efficacy of this innovative intervention in improving executive function
  and alleviating ADHD symptoms.'
