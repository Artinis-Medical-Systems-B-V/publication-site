abstract: "Subcortical vascular dementia (SVD) is a form of vascular dementia from\
  \ small vessel disease with white matter lesions and lacunes. We hypothesized that\
  \ hemodynamic and metabolic changes in the cortex during a simple motor task may\
  \ reflect the impaired neurovascular coupling in SVD. We used fMRI and near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy (NIRS) simultaneously, which together provided multiple hemodynamic\
  \ responses as well as a robust estimation of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen\
  \ (CMRO2). During the task periods, the oxy-hemoglobin, total-hemoglobin, blood\
  \ oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and CMRO2\
  \ decreased statistically significantly in the primary motor and somatosensory cortices\
  \ of SVD patients, whereas the oxygen extraction fraction increased when compared\
  \ with controls. Notably, the flow-metabolism coupling ratio, n representing the\
  \ ratio of oxygen supply to its utilization, showed a robust reduction in the SVD\
  \ patient group (nControl=1.99\xB10.23; nSVD=1.08\xB10.24), which implies a loss\
  \ of metabolic reserve. These results support the pathological small vessel compromise,\
  \ including an increased vessel stiffness, impaired vascular reactivity, and impaired\
  \ neurovascular coupling in SVD. In conclusion, simultaneous measurement by NIRS\
  \ and fMRI can reveal various hemodynamic and metabolic changes and may be used\
  \ for as an early detection or monitoring of SVD. \xA9 2010 Elsevier Inc."
