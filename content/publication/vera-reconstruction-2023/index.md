abstract: Functional near infrared spectroscopy has been used in recent decades to
  sense and quantify changes in hemoglobin concentrations in the human brain. This
  noninvasive technique can deliver useful information concerning brain cortex activation
  associated with different motor/cognitive tasks or external stimuli. This is usually
  accomplished by considering the human head as a homogeneous medium; however, this
  approach does not explicitly take into account the detailed layered structure of
  the head, and thus, extracerebral signals can mask those arising at the cortex level.
  This work improves this situation by considering layered models of the human head
  during reconstruction of the absorption changes in layered media. To this end, analytically
  calculated mean partial pathlengths of photons are used, which guarantees fast and
  simple implementation in real-time applications. Results obtained from synthetic
  data generated by Monte Carlo simulations in two- and four-layered turbid media
  suggest that a layered description of the human head greatly outperforms typical
  homogeneous reconstructions, with errors, in the first case, bounded up to ∼20%
  maximum, while in the second case, the error is usually larger than 75%. Experimental
  measurements on dynamic phantoms support this conclusion.
