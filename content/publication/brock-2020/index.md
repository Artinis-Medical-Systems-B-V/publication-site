abstract: "CONTEXT: Several interventions are available to reduce the intensity and\
  \ duration of the unwanted effects (eg,\_muscle soreness) associated with physical\
  \ activity, such as massage, compression garments, and sequential pulse compression\
  \ (SPC). Such interventions aim to increase blood flow to alleviate symptoms. However,\
  \ there is a lack of evidence to support the use of SPC to alter total hemoglobin\
  \ concentration (THb) in active individuals. OBJECTIVE: To examine the acute effects\
  \ of a single session of SPC on hemoglobin concentration compared with a control\
  \ condition. DESIGN: Single cohort, crossover design. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-four\
  \ physically active and healthy participants (females = 12 and males = 22) completed\
  \ the study. INTERVENTIONS: The authors randomly assigned participants to first\
  \ receive the experimental (SPC) or control condition. Measures were recorded precondition\
  \ and postcondition. Participants returned to the laboratory to complete the second\
  \ condition \u226524 hours after the first condition. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relative\
  \ changes in THb, deoxygenated hemoglobin, and oxygenated hemoglobin measures were\
  \ recorded using near-infrared spectroscopy placed on the muscle belly of the medial\
  \ gastrocnemius of the dominant limb. RESULTS: SPC significantly increased THb (P\
  \ < .001, d = 0.505) and oxygenated hemoglobin (P < .001, d = 0.745) change scores\
  \ compared with the control condition. No statistical difference in deoxygenated\
  \ hemoglobin change scores was found between the SPC and control conditions, but\
  \ a medium effect size suggests potential biological significance (P = .06, d =\
  \ 0.339). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, SPC increases THb to the lower-extremity and may\
  \ be a viable option in the management of muscle soreness related to physical activity."
