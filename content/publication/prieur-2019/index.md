abstract: "Background and objective: We hypothesized that by reducing respiratory\
  \ work and improving gas exchange, nasal high flow (NHF) would improve exercise\
  \ tolerance in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) following\
  \ respiratory exacerbation. Methods: This was a monocentric, randomized, controlled\
  \ crossover study. Patients with severe to very severe COPD carried out two high-intensity\
  \ constant work-rate exercise tests (CWRET) with and without NHF on two consecutive\
  \ days. The primary outcome was the mean difference in endurance time between both\
  \ conditions. The secondary aims included vastus lateralis oxygenation (StO2), dyspnoea,\
  \ leg discomfort, maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), transcutaneous CO2 pressure\
  \ (PtcCO2), respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR) and pulsed O2 saturation (SpO2),\
  \ as well as the patients' opinions of the device. Results: A total of 19 patients\
  \ were included (mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s = 28.7 \xB1 10.8%, age = 62.1\
  \ \xB1 9.1 years). No significant differences in endurance time during the CWRET\
  \ were found between the two test conditions (\u221266.58 (95% CI: \u2212155.9 to\
  \ 22.7) s, P = 0.12). StO2, PtCO2 and HR were reduced at the end of the exercise\
  \ with NHF (\u22122.1% (95% CI: \u22124.3 to \u22120.0); \u22121.3 mm Hg (95% CI:\
  \ \u22122.5 to \u22120.2); \u22122.7 bpm (95% CI: \u22125.0 to \u22120.5), respectively,\
  \ P \u2264 0.05). No significant differences were found for any of the other secondary\
  \ outcomes. Half of the patients evaluated the device as being moderately to very\
  \ uncomfortable. Conclusion: NHF during exercise did not increase endurance time\
  \ in patients with COPD following exacerbation. Clinical trial registration: NCT03058081\
  \ at clinicaltrials.gov."
