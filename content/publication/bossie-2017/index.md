abstract: "Introduction: In this study we noninvasively evaluated skeletal muscle\
  \ mitochondrial capacity, muscle-specific endurance, and energy/fatigue feelings\
  \ in persons with Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) and able-bodied controls (AB). Methods:\
  \ Forearm mitochondrial capacity was measured in FRDA (n = 16) and AB (n = 10) study\
  \ participants using the rate of recovery of oxygen consumption after electrical\
  \ stimulation with near-infrared spectroscopy. Mechanomyography (MMG) assessed muscle\
  \ endurance after electrical stimulation for 3 minutes at 2 Hz, 4 Hz, and 6 Hz.\
  \ Validated scales assessed disease severity and energy/fatigue feelings. Results:\
  \ Groups did not differ in mitochondrial capacity (FRDA and AB: 1.8 \xB1 0.3 L/min).\
  \ The difference in muscle endurance at 6 Hz was lower by 19.2% in the FRDA group\
  \ (group effect: P < 0.001). Feelings of physical energy were 34% lower in FRDA\
  \ group. In FDRA muscle, endurance was positively related to mitochondrial capacity\
  \ (r = 0.59, P = 0.03), and disease severity was negatively related to mitochondrial\
  \ capacity (r = \u20130.55, P = 0.04) and muscle endurance (r = \u20130.60, P =\
  \ 0.01). Conclusion: Non-invasive measures of skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity\
  \ and muscle-specific endurance are useful in monitoring FRDA. Muscle Nerve 56:\
