abstract: 'Introduction Developing a greater understanding of how the body reacts
  following cold water immersion (CWI) and its impact on human performance is required
  for the development of future monitoring technologies and countermeasures to reduce
  cold-induced impairments. Currently, there are no field-deployable technologies
  for real-time monitoring of cold-induced neurochemical and metabolic changes, limiting
  physiological assessment tools for monitoring the impact of cold immersion on cognitive
  and physical performance. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) may be an
  effective technique for monitoring the impact of cold exposures on neurophysiological
  functions; however, a deeper examination of the fNIRS patterns of responses is needed
  to progress the interpretability of this technique in austere environments. Therefore,
  the purpose of this study was to examine the cerebral hemodynamic responses over
  the prefrontal cortex (PFC) as well as respiratory and common carotid artery (CCA)
  responses during a 10-minute CWI. Materials and Methods Twenty-six participants
  (age = 23.6 ± 4.3 years) completed 2 testing visits, which consisted of a 10-minute
  thermoneutral water immersion (TWI; 35 °C) or CWI (15 °C). Functional near-infrared
  spectroscopy-derived oxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb) was measured over the PFC, as
  well as respiratory rate, tidal volume, and CCA diameter, were measured at the beginning
  and end of the immersion period. In addition, skin temperature (Tsk) and thermal
  perception were measured during each condition. Repeated measures ANOVA’s were used
  to examine the condition and time course of response changes for Tsk, respiratory
  rate, tidal volume, thermal perception, and CCA diameter. A general linear model
  analysis was used to examine differences in beta values of the O2Hb between the
  TWI and CWI conditions. This study was approved by the university’s institutional
  review board (IRB: 2115890). Results There was no significant change in O2Hb during
  the TWI condition (P = .15), however, O2Hb significantly increased during the CWI
  (P textless .01). The CCA diameter did not change during the TWI (P = .84) but increased
  during the CWI (P textless .01). There was a significant decrease in Tsk (P textless .01)
  during CWI and greater thermal perception compared to TWI (P textless .01), which
  showed no significant changes (P = .06-.82). Respiratory rate remained unchanged
  (P = .59). Tidal volume was significantly greater during the CWI compared to TWI
  (P textless .01). Conclusions Initial exposure to CWI induced a cold shock response
  with a 43% increase in tidal volume, without a corresponding increase in respiratory
  rate. This suggested a potential, intuitive, cold-mitigation strategy in cold naïve
  participants. In addition, the O2Hb responses indicated a short-lived, cold-induced
  mismatch between cerebral oxygen demand and supply. The increase in cerebral oxygenation
  reflects a cold-induced increase in cerebral blood flow to prevent localized temperature
  drops, along with elevated counter-current vascularization and metabolic heat generation.'
