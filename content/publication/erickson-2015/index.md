abstract: "New Findings: What is the central question of this study? Do patients with\
  \ cystic fibrosis have reduced skeletal muscle oxidative capacity, measured with\
  \ near-infrared spectroscopy, compared with demographically matched control subjects?\
  \ What is the main finding and is its importance? Patients with cystic fibrosis\
  \ have impairments in skeletal muscle oxidative capacity. This reduced skeletal\
  \ muscle oxidative capacity not only appears to be accelerated by age, but it may\
  \ also contribute to exercise intolerance in patients with cystic fibrosis. Exercise\
  \ intolerance predicts mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF); however,\
  \ the mechanisms have yet to be elucidated fully. Using near-infrared spectroscopy,\
  \ in this study we compared skeletal muscle oxidative capacity in patients with\
  \ CF versus healthy control subjects. Thirteen patients and 16 demographically matched\
  \ control subjects participated in this study. Near-infrared spectroscopy was used\
  \ to measure the recovery rate of oxygen consumption ( mus V\u02D9O2 max) of the\
  \ vastus lateralis muscle after 15 s of electrical stimulation (4 Hz) and subsequent\
  \ repeated transient arterial occlusions. The mus V\u02D9O2 max was reduced in patients\
  \ with CF (1.82 \xB1 0.4 min-1) compared with control subjects (2.13 \xB1 0.5 min-1,\
  \ P = 0.04). A significant inverse relationship between age and mus V\u02D9O2 max\
  \ was observed in patients with CF (r = -0.676, P = 0.011) but not in control subjects\
  \ (r = -0.291, P = 0.274). Patients with CF exhibit a reduction in skeletal muscle\
  \ oxidative capacity compared with control subjects. It appears that the reduced\
  \ skeletal muscle oxidative capacity is accelerated by age and could probably contribute\
  \ to exercise intolerance in patients with CF."
