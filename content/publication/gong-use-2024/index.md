  Abstract-Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has been increasingly applied
  in poststroke research. The accumulated evidence in this area warrants a comprehensive
  review systematically investigating the utility of fNIRS in poststroke rehabilitation,
  specifically focusing on upper limb motor recovery. The target of this systematic
  review was the use of fNIRS for monitoring brain function, predicting outcomes,
  and evaluating rehabilitative interventional responses in poststroke patients with
  upper limb hemiplegia. A literature search was carried out using PubMed, Web of
  Science, EMBASE, Medline, and IEEE Explore, to identify studies that applied fNIRS
  in stroke survivors. A total of 52 studies were included, with 23 cross-sectional
  studies, 6 longitudinal studies and 23 interventional studies. The majority of the
  included fNIRS studies displayed a bilateral activation pattern in patients after
  stroke during paretic upper limb movement. The change in hemispheric laterality,
  measured by oxygenated hemoglobin concentration changes (Δ[HbO]) 1 levels in different
  corticomotor regions, has been found to be correlated with motor recovery following
  a stroke. Various rehabilitation interventions, such as exercise-based, stimulation-based,
  and neurofeedback techniques, improved recovery outcomes by increasing Δ[HbO] levels
  in the ipsilesional sensorimotor and secondary motor areas. These interventions
  also recruit different brain regions connected to the ipsilesional sensorimotor
  area, thereby strengthening their connectivity. In conclusion, outcomes derived
  from fNIRS demonstrate promise in monitoring brain function, predicting outcomes,
  and evaluating responses to interventions in patients after stroke. Future fNIRS
  research can be enhanced by adhering to best practice checklists, utilizing the
  latest experimental setup and analysis protocols, and recruiting large sample sizes.
