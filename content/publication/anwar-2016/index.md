abstract: "Recently, interest has been growing to understand the underlying dynamic\
  \ directional relationship between simultaneously activated regions of the brain\
  \ during motor task performance. Such directionality analysis (or effective connectivity\
  \ analysis), based on non-invasive electrophysiological (electroencephalography\u2014\
  EEG) and hemodynamic (functional near infrared spectroscopy\u2014fNIRS; and functional\
  \ magnetic resonance imaging\u2014fMRI) neuroimaging modalities can provide an estimate\
  \ of the motor task-related information flow from one brain region to another. Since\
  \ EEG, fNIRS and fMRI modalities achieve different spatial and temporal resolutions\
  \ of motor-task related activation in the brain, the aim of this study was to determine\
  \ the effective connectivity of cortico-cortical sensorimotor networks during finger\
  \ movement tasks measured by each neuroimaging modality. Nine healthy subjects performed\
  \ right hand finger movement tasks of different complexity (simple finger tapping-FT,\
  \ simple finger sequence-SFS, and complex finger sequence-CFS). We focused our observations\
  \ on three cortical regions of interest (ROIs), namely the contralateral sensorimotor\
  \ cortex (SMC), the contralateral premotor cortex (PMC) and the contralateral dorsolateral\
  \ prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). We estimated the effective connectivity between these\
  \ ROIs using conditional Granger causality (GC) analysis determined from the time\
  \ series signals measured by fMRI (blood oxygenation level-dependent-BOLD), fNIRS\
  \ (oxygenated-O2Hb and deoxygenated-HHb hemoglobin), and EEG (scalp and source level\
  \ analysis) neuroimaging modalities. The effective connectivity analysis showed\
  \ significant bi-directional information flow between the SMC, PMC, and DLPFC as\
  \ determined by the EEG (scalp and source), fMRI (BOLD) and fNIRS (O2Hb and HHb)\
  \ modalities for all three motor tasks. However the source level EEG GC values were\
  \ significantly greater than the other modalities. In addition, only the source\
  \ level EEG showed a significantly greater forward than backward information flow\
  \ between the ROIs. This simultaneous fMRI, fNIRS and EEG study has shown through\
  \ independent GC analysis of the respective time series that a bi-directional effective\
  \ connectivity occurs within a cortico-cortical sensorimotor network (SMC, PMC and\
  \ DLPFC) during finger movement tasks."
