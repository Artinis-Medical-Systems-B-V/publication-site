abstract: "Purpose: To study performance, physiological and biomechanical responses\
  \ during repeated upper-body sprint exercise. Methods: Twelve male elite cross-country\
  \ skiers performed eight 8-s maximal poling sprints with a 22-s recovery while sitting\
  \ on a modified SkiErg poling ergometer. Force, movement velocity, cycle rate, work\
  \ per cycle, oxygen saturation in working muscles and pulmonary oxygen uptake were\
  \ measured continuously. A 3-min all-out ergometer poling test determined VO2peak,\
  \ and 1 repetition maximum (1RM) strength was determined in a movement-specific\
  \ pull-down. Results: Average sprint power was 281\_\xB1\_48\_W, with the highest\
  \ power on the first sprint, a progressive decline in power output over the following\
  \ four sprints, and a sprint decrement of 11.7\_\xB1\_4.1\_%. Cycle rate remained\
  \ unchanged, whereas work per cycle progressively decreased (P\_<\_0.05). m. triceps\
  \ brachii and m. latissimus dorsi were highly desaturated already after the first\
  \ sprint (all P\_<\_0.05), whereas the response was delayed for m. biceps brachii\
  \ and m. vastus lateralis. Correspondingly, increases in VO2 mainly occurred over\
  \ the first two sprints (P\_<\_0.05) and plateaued at approximately 75\_% of VO2peak.\
  \ 1RM correlated with power during the first four sprints and with average sprint\
  \ power (r\_=\_0.71\u20130.80, all P\_<\_0.05), whereas VO2peak correlated with\
  \ power in the last three sprints (r\_=\_0.60\u20130.71, all P\_<\_0.05). Conclusions:\
  \ The main decrement in upper-body sprint performance was evident in the first five\
  \ sprints, followed by highly desaturated muscles and a plateau in pulmonary oxygen\
  \ uptake already after the first 2\u20133 sprints. While high maximal strength seems\
  \ important for producing power, aerobic capacity correlates with power in the last\
  \ sprints."
