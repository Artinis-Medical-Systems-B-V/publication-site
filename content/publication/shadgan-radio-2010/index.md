abstract: "Background:Medical and diagnostic applications of near infrared spectroscopy\
  \ (NIRS) areincreasing, especially in operating rooms (OR). Since NIRS is anoptical\
  \ technique, radio frequency (RF) interference from other instruments isunlikely\
  \ to affect the raw optical data, however, NIRS dataprocessing and signal output\
  \ could be affected. Methods: We investigatedthe potential for three common OR instruments:\
  \ an electrical cautery,an orthopaedic drill and an imaging system, to generate\
  \ electromagneticinterference (EMI) that could potentially influence NIRS signals.\
  \ The timeof onset and duration of every operation of each devicewas recorded during\
  \ surgery. To remove the effects of slowchanging physiological variables, we first\
  \ used a lowpass filter andthen selected 2 windows with variable lengths around\
  \ the momentof device onset. For each instant, variances (energy) and meansof the\
  \ signals in the 2 windows were compared. Results:Twenty patients were studied during\
  \ ankle surgery. Analysis shows nostatistically significant difference in the means\
  \ and variance of theNIRS signals (p < 0.01) during operation of any ofthe three\
  \ devices for all surgeries. Conclusion: This method confirmsthe instruments evaluated\
  \ caused no significant interference. NIRS can potentiallybe used without EMI in\
  \ clinical environments such as theOR. \xA92010 COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International\
