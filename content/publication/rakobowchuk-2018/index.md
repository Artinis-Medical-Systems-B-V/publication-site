abstract: "Muscle deoxygenation responses provide information about the training impulse\
  \ of an exercise session enabling adaptation to be predicted. Our aim was to investigate\
  \ muscle oxygenation profiles during prolonged low-intensity eccentric and concentric\
  \ cycling. Twelve healthy men performed two 45-min exercise sessions of concentric\
  \ (CON) and eccentric (ECC) cycling, matched for the same heart rate at the start\
  \ of each session. Mechanical power output during ECC was \u223C2.5 times that of\
  \ CON (210\xB140 W vs. 82\xB116 W). Oxygen uptake, blood lactate, cardiac output\
  \ and systolic arterial pressure responses did not differ between exercises. Heart\
  \ rate was similar at 5 min of each exercise bout but progressively increased during\
  \ ECC and was higher at 15, 30 and 45 min of ECC compared to CON (+10 bpm), with\
  \ a trend for a lower stroke volume. Diastolic and mean blood pressures were higher\
  \ during ECC. No significant differences were observed in muscle oxygenation profiles.\
  \ Muscle oxygenation responses during prolonged low-intensity exercise were not\
  \ affected by the type of muscle action at the same metabolic demand and cardiac\
  \ output."
