abstract: "Background. Walking while performing another task (eg, talking) is challenging\
  \ for many stroke survivors, yet its neural basis are not fully understood. Objective.\
  \ To investigate prefrontal cortex activation and its relationship to gait measures\
  \ while walking under single-task (ST) and dual-task (DT) conditions (ie, walking\
  \ while simultaneously performing a cognitive task) in stroke survivors. Methods.\
  \ We acquired near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data from the prefrontal cortex\
  \ during treadmill walking in ST and DT conditions in chronic stroke survivors and\
  \ healthy controls. We also acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)\
  \ and NIRS during simulated walking under these conditions. Results. NIRS revealed\
  \ increased oxygenated hemoglobin concentration in DT-walking compared with ST-walking\
  \ for both groups. For simulated walking, NIRS showed a significant effect of group\
  \ and group \xD7 task, being greater on both occasions, in stroke survivors. A greater\
  \ increase in brain activation observed from ST to DT walking/ simulated walking\
  \ was related to a greater change in motor performance in stroke survivors. fMRI\
  \ revealed increased activity during DT relative to ST conditions in stroke patients\
  \ in areas including the inferior temporal gyri, superior frontal gyri and cingulate\
  \ gyri bilaterally, and the right precentral gyrus. The DT-related increase in fMRI\
  \ activity correlated with DT-related change in behavior in stroke participants\
  \ in the bilateral inferior temporal gyrus, left cingulate gyrus, and left frontal\
  \ pole. Conclusion. Our results provide novel evidence that enhanced brain activity\
  \ changes relate to dual task motor decrements."
