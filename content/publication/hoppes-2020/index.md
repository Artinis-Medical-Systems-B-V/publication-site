abstract: 'Background and Purpose: Persons with vestibular disorders are known to
  have slower gait speed with greater imbalance and veering during dual-task walking
  than healthy individuals, but the cerebral mechanisms are unknown. The purpose of
  this study was to determine whether individuals with visual vertigo (VV) have different
  cerebral activation during dual-task walking compared with control subjects. Methods:
  Fourteen individuals with VV and 14 healthy controls (CON) were included (mean 39
  years old, 85% women). A cross-sectional experimental study consisting of 4 combinations
  of 2 surfaces (even and uneven) and 2 task conditions (single- and dual-task) was
  performed. Participants walked over an even (level flooring) or uneven (wood prisms
  underneath carpeting) surface, either quietly or while reciting every other letter
  of the alphabet. Changes in cerebral activation over the bilateral prefrontal cortices
  were recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy during 4 task conditions
  relative to quiet standing. Gait speed and cognitive performance were recorded.
  Results: There were no between-group differences in cognitive performance. Both
  groups slowed when walking on an uneven surface or performing a dual-task; participants
  in the VV group walked more slowly than those in the CON group in all conditions.
  Participants with VV had decreased cerebral activation in the bilateral prefrontal
  regions in comparison to CON participants in all conditions. Discussion and Conclusions:
  Participants with VV had lower prefrontal cortex activation than CON participants
  during dual-task walking. Lower cortical activity in those with VV may be due to
  shifted attention away from the cognitive task to prioritize maintenance of dynamic
  balance. Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the Video,
