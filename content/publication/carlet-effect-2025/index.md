abstract: 'Purpose Strength-related exerkines may be promoted in response to exercise
  imposing high mechanical stress on the skeletal muscles. For a constant velocity,
  the inclination of the slope during downhill exercise influences the total mechanical
  load. The aim of the study was to compare exerkines release following two prolonged
  decline walking (-10% and -20%) exercise session.  Methods Twelve moderately active
  healthy men (age: 23.3 ± 3.6 years; mass: 70.0 ± 4.5 kg; height: 177.2 ± 2.9 cm;
  body fat: 13.1 ± 3.2%) performed two 45-min downhill treadmill exercises at -10%
  (DOWN10) and -20% (DOWN20) slopes at the same pace (6 km.h−1). Heart rate and muscle
  oxygenation were monitored during exercise and blood samples were taken before,
  1 h and 24 h after exercise.  Results Heart rate and muscle oxygenation were respectively
  greater and lower during DOWN20 exercise than DOWN10. Myostatin (MSTN; DOWN10 p ≤ 0.01
  and DOWN20 p ≤ 0.05) and interleukine-6 (DOWN10 and DOWN20 p ≤ 0.001) levels increased
  1 h-post exercise in both conditions while no difference was found for decorin,
  follistatin and the growth differentiation factor-15 levels. No difference on exerkines
  release was evidenced between − 10% and − 20% treadmill slope but a significant
  condition effect between DOWN20 and DOWN10 was observed for DCN (p ≤ 0.05).  Conclusion
  A 45-min downhill walking exercise at a − 10% slope represents a valid strategy
  to stimulate the cardiovascular and muscular functions, as inferred from the increase
  in MSTN and IL-6 exerkines levels, and the use of a steepest slope protocol is no
  a prerequisite to elicit greater responses.'
