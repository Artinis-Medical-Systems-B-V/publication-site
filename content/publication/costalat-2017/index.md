abstract: "We investigated the oxygen-conserving potential of the human diving response\
  \ by comparing trained breath-hold divers (BHDs) to non-divers (NDs) during simulated\
  \ dynamic breath-holding (BH). Changes in haemodynamics [heart rate (HR), stroke\
  \ volume (SV), cardiac output (CO)] and peripheral muscle oxygenation [oxyhaemoglobin\
  \ ([HbO2]), deoxyhaemoglobin ([HHb]), total haemoglobin ([tHb]), tissue saturation\
  \ index (TSI)] and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) were continuously recorded\
  \ during simulated dynamic BH. BHDs showed a breaking point in HR kinetics at mid-BH\
  \ immediately preceding a more pronounced drop in HR (\u22120.86\_bpm.%\u22121)\
  \ while HR kinetics in NDs steadily decreased throughout BH (\u22120.47\_bpm.%\u2212\
  1). By contrast, SV remained unchanged during BH in both groups (all P\_>\_0.05).\
  \ Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) results (mean \xB1 SD) expressed as percentage\
  \ changes from the initial values showed a lower [HHb] increase for BHDs than for\
  \ NDs at the cessation of BH (+24.0\_\xB1\_10.1 vs. +39.2\_\xB1\_9.6%, respectively;\
  \ P\_<\_0.05). As a result, BHDs showed a [tHb] drop that NDs did not at the end\
  \ of BH (\u22127.3\_\xB1\_3.2 vs. \u22123.0\_\xB1\_4.7%, respectively; P\_<\_0.05).\
  \ The most striking finding of the present study was that BHDs presented an increase\
  \ in oxygen-conserving efficiency due to substantial shifts in both cardiac and\
  \ peripheral haemodynamics during simulated BH. In addition, the kinetic-based approach\
  \ we used provides further credence to the concept of an \u201Coxygen-conserving\
  \ breaking point\u201D in the human diving response."
