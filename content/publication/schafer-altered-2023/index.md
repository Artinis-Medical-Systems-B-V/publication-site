abstract: 'Background: Post COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is a complex condition with partly
  substantial impact on patients'' social and professional life and overall life quality.
  Currently, the underlying cause(s) of PCS are unknown. Since PCS-specific symptoms
  could be associated with systemic alterations in tissue oxygen supply, we aimed
  to investigate changes in tissue oxygenation in patients with PCS.  Methods: A case-control
  study including 30 PCS patients (66.6 % males, 48.6 ± 11.2 years, mean time after
  (first) acute infection: 324 days), 16 cardiologic patients (CVD) (65.5 % males,
  56.7 ± 6.3 years) and 11 young healthy controls (55 % males, 28.5 ± 7.4 years) was
  conducted. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to assess changes in tissue
  oxygenation during an arterial occlusion protocol on the non-dominant forearm (brachioradialis,
  760/850 nm, 5 Hz). The protocol included 10-min rest, a 2-min baseline measurement
  followed by a 3-min ischemic period (upper-arm cuff, 50 mmHg above resting systolic
  blood pressure) and a 3-min reoxygenation period. PCS patients were grouped by presence
  of arterial hypertension and elevated BMI to assess the impact of risk factors.  Results:
  No differences in mean tissue oxygenation in the pre-occlusion phase existed between
  groups (p ≥ 0.566). During ischemia, comparisons of linear regressions slopes revealed
  slower oxygen desaturation for PCS patients (-0.064 %/s) compared to CVD patients
  (-0.08 %/s) and healthy subjects (-0.145 %/s) (p textless 0.001). After cuff release,
  slowest speed for reoxygenation was detected in PCS patients at 0.84 %/s compared
  to CVD patients (1.04 %/s) and healthy controls (CG: 2.07 %/s) (p textless 0.001).
  The differences between PCS patients and CVD patients during ischemia remained significant
  also after correction for risk factors. Analyses of complications during acute infection,
  persistence of PCS symptoms (time after acute infection), or PCS severity (number
  of lead symptoms) as confounding factors did not reveal a significant effect.  Conclusions:
  This study provides evidence that the rate of tissue oxygen consumption is persistently
  altered in PCS and that PCS patients show an even slower decline in tissue oxygenation
  during occlusion than CVD patients. Our observations may at least partly explain
  PCS-specific symptoms such as physical impairment and fatigue.'
