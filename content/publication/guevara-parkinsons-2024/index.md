abstract: Significance People with Parkinson’s disease (PD) experience changes in
  fine motor skills, which is viewed as one of the hallmark signs of this disease.
  Due to its non-invasive nature and portability, functional near-infrared spectroscopy
  (fNIRS) is a promising tool for assessing changes related to fine motor skills.  Aim
  We aim to compare activation patterns in the primary motor cortex using fNIRS, comparing
  volunteers with PD and sex- and age-matched control participants during a fine motor
  task and walking. Moreover, inter and intrahemispheric functional connectivity (FC)
  was investigated during the resting state.  Approach We used fNIRS to measure the
  hemodynamic changes in the primary motor cortex elicited by a finger-tapping task
  in 20 PD patients and 20 controls matched for age, sex, education, and body mass
  index. In addition, a two-minute walking task was carried out. Resting-state FC
  was also assessed.  Results Patients with PD showed delayed hypoactivation in the
  motor cortex during the fine motor task with the dominant hand and delayed hyperactivation
  with the non-dominant hand. The findings also revealed significant correlations
  among various measures of hemodynamic activity in the motor cortex using fNIRS and
  different cognitive and clinical variables. There were no significant differences
  between patients with PD and controls during the walking task. However, there were
  significant differences in interhemispheric connectivity between PD patients and
  control participants, with a statistically significant decrease in PD patients compared
  with control participants.
