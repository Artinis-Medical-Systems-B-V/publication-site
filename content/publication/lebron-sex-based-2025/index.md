abstract: 'Background: This investigation aimed to examine sex-based differences in
  deoxy[heme] (HHb), tissue saturation (StO2), and force-deoxygenation ratio (FD)
  of the forearm flexor muscles during a maximal-effort intermittent fatiguing handgrip
  protocol. Methods: Thirty-three healthy males (n = 15) and females (n = 18) completed
  a fatiguing handgrip protocol consisting of 60 4 s contractions separated by a 1
  s rest. Near-infrared spectroscopy was used to measure muscle oxygenation before,
  during, and after the protocol. Results: Sex differences in HHb (p = 0.033) and
  StO2 (p = 0.021) were observed with significantly greater values for females (HHb:
  110.204 ± 12.626% of baseline; StO2: 72.091 ± 5.812%) in comparison to males (HHb:
  101.153 ± 12.847% of baseline; StO2: 66.978 ± 7.799%). Females (0.199 ± 0.081 AU)
  also demonstrated significantly (p = 0.001) lower FD in comparison to males (0.216
  ± 0.094 AU). However, males (b = −0.023 ± 0.008 AU) demonstrated a significantly
  (p textless 0.001) greater rate of decline in FD in comparison to females (b = −0.017
  ± 0.006 AU). Conclusions: Prior to, during, and after a maximal-effort intermittent
  fatiguing handgrip fatiguing protocol, males demonstrate significantly lower StO2
  than females and a faster rate of decline in FD. Moreover, females demonstrate greater
  HHb values than males when assessed relative to a resting baseline.'
