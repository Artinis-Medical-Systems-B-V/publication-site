abstract: 'The aim of this study was to assess the applicability of the Mechanical
  Systems Coordination Working Group’s (MSCWG) findings, based on FAR 25.831(g), to
  Chinese pilots through a human physiological experiment conducted in a high-temperature
  environment to investigate the effects of core temperature. Methods: A controlled
  experiment was carried out in a high-temperature environment simulation room involving
  a cohort of healthy males aged 18–50 years. Wireless physiological monitoring equipment
  and a neurobehavioral assessment system were utilized to track changes in physiological
  parameters and neurobehavioral responses at varying core temperatures and time intervals.
  Results: There was a significant increase in human core body temperature, skin temperature,
  and heart rate as the ambient temperature rose, all remaining within acceptable
  physiological limits. Although arterial and venous oxygen saturation decreased with
  increasing ambient temperature, the difference was not statistically significant.
  The neurobehavioral abilities of the subjects did not exhibit notable changes across
  different core temperature–time conditions. Conclusions: The core temperature limits
  set forth by the MSCWG have been shown to have a safe impact on the physiological
  and behavioral aspects of Chinese pilots, which can be used as an equivalent safety
  regulation for airworthiness compliance validation under CCAR 25.831(g). Limitation:
  The present study was constrained to a male sample, it did not thoroughly explore
  female responses, and it had a small sample size (10 per group). The latter two
  factors may have affected the statistical validity and generalizability of the results.'
