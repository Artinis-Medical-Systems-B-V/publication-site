abstract: "The study aim was to compare the predictive validity of the often referenced\
  \ traditional model of human endurance performance (i.e. oxygen consumption, VO2,\
  \ or power at maximal effort, fatigue threshold values, and indices of exercise\
  \ efficiency) versus measures of skeletal muscle oxidative potential in relation\
  \ to endurance cycling performance. We hypothesized that skeletal muscle oxidative\
  \ potential would more completely explain endurance performance than the traditional\
  \ model, which has never been collectively verified with cycling. Accordingly, we\
  \ obtained nine measures of VO2 or power at maximal efforts, 20 measures reflective\
  \ of various fatigue threshold values, 14 indices of cycling efficiency, and near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy-derived measures reflecting in vivo skeletal muscle oxidative potential.\
  \ Forward regression modeling identified variable combinations that best explained\
  \ 25-km time trial time-to-completion (TTC) across a group of trained male participants\
  \ (n\_=\_24). The time constant for skeletal muscle oxygen consumption recovery,\
  \ a validated measure of maximal skeletal muscle respiration, explained 92.7% of\
  \ TTC variance by itself (Adj R2\_=.927, F\_=\_294.2, SEE\_=\_71.2, p\_<.001). Alternatively,\
  \ the best complete traditional model of performance, including VO2max (L\u02D9\
  min\u22121), %VO2max determined by the ventilatory equivalents method, and cycling\
  \ economy at 50\_W, only explained 76.2% of TTC variance (Adj R2\_=.762, F\_=\_\
  25.6, SEE\_=\_128.7, p\_<.001). These results confirm our hypothesis by demonstrating\
  \ that maximal rates of skeletal muscle respiration more completely explain cycling\
  \ endurance performance than even the best combination of traditional variables\
  \ long postulated to predict human endurance performance."
