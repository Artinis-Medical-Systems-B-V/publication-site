abstract: The success of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) systems is largely dependent
  on the ability to record and interpret clear neurophysiological signals invasively
  or noninvasively through the scalp and skull. In particular, two noninvasive techniques
  of recording neurophysiological signals namely electroencephalography (EEG) and
  functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) have been extensively used in BCI
  research. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the underpinning physiology
  of EEG and fNIRS signals and the application of both techniques in BCI research.
  We further discuss the inherent limitation of EEG and fNIRS in BCI research and
  potential solutions of addressing these limitations.
