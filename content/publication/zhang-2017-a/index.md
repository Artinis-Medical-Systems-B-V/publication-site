abstract: "Sustained attention is the ability to keep focused and vigilance for long\
  \ time in external stimulation, which was crucial in safe-critical human-machine\
  \ system. While the ability of sustained attention will decline because of mental\
  \ fatigue, even lead to serious accidents in fatigue state. Therefore, it is of\
  \ great significance to explore the impact of fatigue on sustained attention. Functional\
  \ Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) can measure cerebral hemoglobin in order to\
  \ reflect cognitive function indirectly. In previous related fatigue studies, monotonous\
  \ and long-time CPT (continuous performance test task) was often used to explore\
  \ the performance change and brain activity, but the effect of time on task (TOT)\
  \ was always involved. In this study, in order to avoid the TOT effect, the sustained\
  \ attention task and fatigue task were separated. It was adopted in the study that\
  \ the modified continuous performance test (CPT) was chosen as the sustained attention\
  \ task and verbal 2-back task as the fatigue induced task. The fNIRS signals were\
  \ extracted from 10 channels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) from 20 healthy subjects.\
  \ Studies found that cerebral lateralization increased significantly from alert\
  \ to fatigue state in sustained attention task. Besides, Average oxyhemoglobin (HBO)\
  \ of PFC increased significantly from alert to fatigue task, and the spatial pattern\
  \ of activity of oxyhemoglobin also changed, which c be sensitive features to fatigue\
  \ detection. \xA9 2017 SPIE."
