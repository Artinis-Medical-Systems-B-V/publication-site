abstract: The act of performing music may induce a specific state of mind, musicians
  potentially becoming immersed and detached from the rest of the world. May this
  be measured? Does this state of mind change based on repetition? In collaboration
  with Stavanger Symphony Orchestra (SSO), we developed protocols to investigate ongoing
  changes in the brain activation of a first violinist and a second violinist in real
  time during seven sequential, public concerts using functional near-infrared spectroscopy
  (fNIRS). Using wireless fNIRS systems (Brite MKII) from Artinis, we measured ongoing
  hemodynamic changes and projected the brain activation to the audience through the
  software OxySoft 3.5.15.2. We subsequently developed protocols for further analyses
  through the Matlab toolboxes Brainstorm and Homer2/Homer3. Our developed protocols
  demonstrate how one may use “functional dissection” to imply how the state of mind
  of musicians may alter while performing their art. We focused on a subset of cortical
  regions in the right hemisphere, but the current study demonstrates how fNIRS may
  be used to shed light on brain dynamics related to producing art in ecological and
  natural contexts on a general level, neither restricted to the use of musical instrument
  nor art form.
