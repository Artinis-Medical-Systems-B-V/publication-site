abstract: Skeletal muscle perfusion and oxygenation are commonly evaluated using Doppler
  ultrasound and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) techniques. However, a recently
  developed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence, termed PIVOT, permits the simultaneous
  collection of skeletal muscle perfusion and T2* (an index of skeletal muscle oxygenation).  Purpose
  To determine the level of agreement between PIVOT, Doppler ultrasound, and NIRS-based
  assessments of skeletal muscle perfusion and oxygenation.  Methods Twelve healthy
  volunteers (8 females, 25 ± 3 years, 170 ± 11 cm, 71.5 ± 8.0 kg) performed six total
  reactive hyperemia protocols. During three of these reactive hyperemia protocols,
  Tissue Saturation Index (TSI) and oxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb) were recorded from
  the medial gastrocnemius (MG) and tibialis anterior (TA), and blood flow velocity
  was recorded from the popliteal artery (BFvpop) via Doppler Ultrasound. The other
  three trials were performed inside the bore of a 3 T MRI scanner, and the PIVOT
  sequence was used to assess perfusion (PIVOTperf) and oxygenation (T2*) of the medial
  gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles. Positive incremental areas under the
  curve (iAUC) and times to peak (TTP) were calculated for each variable, and the
  level of agreement between collection methods was evaluated via Bland-Altman analyses
  and Spearman's Rho correlation analyses.  Results The only significant bivariate
  relationships observed were between the T2* vs. TSI iAUC and PIVOTperf vs. BFvpop
  values recorded from the MG. Significant mean differences were observed for all
  comparisons (all P ≤ 0.038), and significant proportional biases were observed for
  the PIVOTperf vs. tHb TTP (R2 = 0.848, P textless 0.001) and T2* vs. TSI TTP comparisons
  in the TA (R2 = 0.488, P = 0.011), and the PIVOTperf vs. BFvpop iAUC (R2 = 0.477,
  P = 0.013) and time to peak (R2 = 0.851, P textless 0.001) comparisons in the MG.  Conclusions
  Our findings suggest that the PIVOT technique has, at best, a moderate level of
  agreement with Doppler ultrasound and NIRS assessment methods and is subject to
  significant proportional bias. These findings do not challenge the accuracy of either
  measurement technique but instead reflect differences in the vascular compartments,
  sampling volumes, and parameters being evaluated.
