abstract: 'We evaluated whether a short-term cycling intervention in hypoxia, with
  blood flow restriction, or eccentric cycling induces greater health benefits than
  traditional cycling in older adults. Fifty-five individuals (68 ± 4 year, 25 females)
  performed supervised moderate-intensity intermittent training (MIIT) three times
  weekly for 4 weeks, assigned to one of four groups: HYP (hypoxic chamber, FiO₂ 14%),
  BFR (thigh cuffs at ≈ 350 mmHg, deflated between sets), ECC (eccentric ergocycle),
  or CON (traditional ergocycle). Pre- and post-training assessments covered cardiovascular
  function, quality of life, cognition, aerobic fitness, skeletal muscle oxidative
  capacity, knee extensors and flexors strength, and thigh volume. Training interventions
  improved the 6-min cycling test average power output (9 ± 15%, P textless 0.001),
  isokinetic at different speeds (10 ± 16 to 20 ± 26%, all P textless 0.001) and isometric
  peak torques (14 ± 15%, P textless 0.001), thigh circumference (1 ± 2%, P = 0.008),
  diastolic pressure (−3 ± 8%, P = 0.021), resting heart rate (−3 ± 7%, P = 0.004),
  digit span (9 ± 21%, P = 0.031) and TMT-B performance (−1 ± 51%, P = 0.045) in all
  groups. However, no significant differences were observed between groups. These
  results confirm the efficacy of MIIT in older adults and suggest that exercise per
  se is more important than the specific modalities. Short-term (4-week) MIIT programs
  promote healthy aging, regardless of the training modality, which may encourage
  older adults to take action'
