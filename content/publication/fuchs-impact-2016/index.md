abstract: "Background: Insulin-stimulated muscle blood flow facilitates plasma glucose\
  \ disposal after a meal, a mechanism that is impaired in obese, insulin-resistant\
  \ volunteers. Nitrate- or flavonoid-rich products, through their proposed effects\
  \ on nitric oxide, may improve postprandial blood flow and, subsequently, glucose\
  \ disposal. To investigate whether a single dose of nitrate-rich beetroot juice\
  \ or flavonoid-rich black tea lowers postprandial muscle vascular resistance in\
  \ obese volunteers and alters postprandial glucose or insulin concentrations. Method:\
  \ In a randomised, controlled, cross-over study, 16 obese, insulin-resistant males\
  \ consumed 75 g glucose, which was combined with 100 ml black tea, beetroot juice\
  \ or control (water). Peripheral vascular resistance (VR), calculated as mean arterial\
  \ pressure divided by blood flow, was assessed in the arm and leg conduit arteries,\
  \ resistance arteries and muscle microcirculation across 3 h (every 30-min) after\
  \ the oral glucose load. Results: During control, we found no postprandial response\
  \ in VR in conduit, resistance and microvessels (all P > 0.05). Black tea decreased\
  \ VR compared to control in conduit, resistance and microvessels (all P < 0.05).\
  \ Beetroot juice decreased postprandial VR in resistance vessels, but not in conduit\
  \ artery and microvessels. Although postprandial glucose response was similar after\
  \ all interventions, postprandial insulin response was attenuated by $\u223C$29\
  \ % after tea (P < 0.0005), but not beetroot juice. Conclusions: A single dose of\
  \ black tea decreased peripheral VR across upper and lower limbs after a glucose\
  \ load which was accompanied by a lower insulin response. Future studies in insulin-resistant\
  \ subjects are warranted to confirm the observed effects and to explore whether\
  \ long-term regular tea consumption affects glucose homeostasis. Trial registration:\
  \ The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov on 30th November 2012 (NCT01746329)."
