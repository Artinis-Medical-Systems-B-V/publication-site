abstract: 'Introduction: Various aspects of yoga have been researched for their psychological
  benefits, yet the neurological mechanisms underlying physical yoga postures (asana)
  remain inadequately explored due to limitations in prior neuroimaging techniques.
  The pre-frontal cortex (PFC) has been established as an important region of interest
  (ROI) concerning psychological health. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize
  changes in the PFC before, during and after asana by applying the functional near-infrared
  spectroscopy (fNIRS) mobile neuroimaging technique. Methods: Twenty-seven healthy
  adults completed two 6-minute, task-independent resting-states before and after
  a 23-minute asana routine. With the fNIRS device positioned on the frontal region
  of the skull, PFC activity was measured during each asana and resting state. The
  block design involved alternating between three active postures and one control
  posture. Each active posture was performed for 30 seconds and repeated 8 times,
  while the control posture was held during inter-trial intervals lasting 25â€“30 seconds.
  Across the session, this block design resulted in a total of 24 active blocks (8
  repetitions of each active posture) and 25 baseline blocks (control posture intervals).
  Results: All three active asanas significantly increased PFC activity versus baseline,
  particularly in the right PFC. Furthermore, analysis of short-term changes in resting-state
  functional connectivity (rsFC) revealed a significant decrease, primarily in the
  left medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), a key region of the default mode network (DMN),
  an area known to exhibit heightened activity in individuals suffering from depression
  and anxiety Conclusion: This study provides neurological insight into the effects
  of yoga asana and supports fNIRS for assessing movement-based practices in real-world
  settings.'
