abstract: "The aim of this study was to examine the acute supplementation effects\
  \ of dietary nitrate, caffeine, and their combination on 20-km cycling time trial\
  \ performance. Using a randomized, counterbalanced, double-blind Latin-square design,\
  \ 14 competitive female cyclists (age: 31 6 7 years; height: 1.69 \xB1 0.07 m; body\
  \ mass: 61.6 \xB1 6.0 kg) completed four 20-km time trials on a racing bicycle fitted\
  \ to a turbo trainer. Approximately 2.5 hours before each trial, subjects consumed\
  \ a 70-ml dose of concentrated beetroot juice containing either 0.45 g of dietary\
  \ nitrate or with the nitrate content removed (placebo). One hour before each trial,\
  \ subjects consumed a capsule containing either 5 mg\u02D9kg-1 of caffeine or maltodextrin\
  \ (placebo). There was a significant effect of supplementation on power output (p\
  \ = 0.001), with post hoc tests revealing higher power outputs in caffeine (205\
  \ \xB1 21 W) vs. nitrate (194 \xB1 22 W) and placebo (194 \xB1 25 W) trials only.\
  \ Caffeine-induced improvements in power output corresponded with significantly\
  \ higher measures of heart rate (caffeine: 166 \xB112 b\u02D9min-1 vs. placebo:\
  \ 159 \xB1 15 b\u02D9min21; p = 0.02), blood lactate (caffeine: 6.54 \xB1 2.40 mmol\u02D9\
  ;L-1 vs. placebo: 4.50 6 2.11 mmol\u02D9L-1; p , 0.001), and respiratory exchange\
  \ ratio (caffeine: 0.95 \xB1 0.04 vs. placebo: 0.91 \xB1 0.05; p = 0.03). There\
  \ were no effects (p \u2265 0.05) of supplementation on cycling cadence, rating\
  \ of perceived exertion, VO2, or integrated electromyographic activity. The results\
  \ of this study support the well-established beneficial effects of caffeine supplementation\
  \ on endurance performance. In contrast, acute supplementation with dietary nitrate\
  \ seems to have no effect on endurance performance and adds nothing to the benefits\
  \ afforded by caffeine supplementation."
