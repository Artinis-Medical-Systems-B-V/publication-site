abstract: "The dose-response effects of the intensity of exercise upon the potential\
  \ regulation (through top-down processes) of affective (pleasure-displeasure) responses\
  \ in the prefrontal cortex during an incremental exercise protocol have not been\
  \ explored. This study examined the functional capacity of the prefrontal cortex\
  \ (reflected by haemodynamics using near infrared spectroscopy) and affective responses\
  \ during exercise at different intensities. Participants completed an incremental\
  \ cycling exercise test to exhaustion. Changes ($\u0394$) in oxygenation (O2Hb),\
  \ deoxygenation (HHb), blood volume (tHb) and haemoglobin difference (HbDiff) were\
  \ measured from bilateral dorsal and ventral prefrontal areas. Affective responses\
  \ were measured every minute during exercise. Data were extracted at intensities\
  \ standardised to: below ventilatory threshold, at ventilatory threshold, respiratory\
  \ compensation point and the end of exercise. During exercise at intensities from\
  \ ventilatory threshold to respiratory compensation point, $\u0394$O2Hb, $\u0394\
  $HbDiff and $\u0394$tHb were greater in mostly ventral than dorsal regions. From\
  \ the respiratory compensation point to the end of exercise, $\u0394$O2Hb remained\
  \ stable and $\u0394$HbDiff declined in dorsal regions. As the intensity increased\
  \ above the ventilatory threshold, inverse associations between affective responses\
  \ and oxygenation in (a) all regions of the left hemisphere and (b) lateral (dorsal\
  \ and ventral) regions followed by the midline (ventral) region in the right hemisphere\
  \ were observed. Differential activation patterns occur within the prefrontal cortex\
  \ and are associated with affective responses during cycling exercise. \xA9 2014\
