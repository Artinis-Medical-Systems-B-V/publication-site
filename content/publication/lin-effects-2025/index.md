abstract: 'Purpose: This study used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
  to investigate the effects of gymnastics programs with high versus low cognitive
  load on children''s visuospatial working memory (VSWM) and prefrontal cortex (PFC)
  oxygenation.  Methods: Eighty-one healthy children aged 7 to 10 from Taipei City
  were randomly assigned to high cognitive load (HG), low cognitive load (LG), and
  control (SC) groups. The HG and LG groups underwent an 8-week gymnastics program
  with different levels of cognitive load, while the SC group participated in a static
  course. Pre- and post-intervention assessments included VSWM tests and simultaneous
  monitoring of PFC oxyhemoglobin (HbO) concentration.  Results: The results showed
  time-related improvements in response accuracy and d-prime (d'') from the pretest
  to posttest for both the HG and LG groups but not for the SC group. Additionally,
  the HG group demonstrated higher response accuracy and d'' compared to the SC group
  at the posttest. Although VSWM-related HbO concentration was higher during task
  conditions requiring higher WM load compared to low WM load, no intervention effect
  was found. Further correlation analysis controlling for intervention-related fitness
  changes revealed positive associations between time-related changes in VSWM performance
  (response accuracy and d'') and HbO concentration across all participants, with
  a similar correlation between response accuracy and HbO remaining specifically in
  the HG group but not other groups.  Conclusions: These findings suggest that a 8-week
  gymnastics program can enhance VSWM performance and such cognitive benefits may
  be maximized by incorporating higher cognitive loads into the intervention. Despite
  the positive correlations between time-related changes in PFC oxygenation and VSWM
  performance, the gymnastics programs did not alter task-related PFC oxygenation,
  suggesting that intervention-induced VSWM improvement may not be solely dependent
  on changes in task-related PFC oxygenation.'
