abstract: "Background: This study examined the effects of different levels of compression\
  \ (0, 20 and 40 mmHg) produced by leg garments on selected psycho-physiological\
  \ measures of performance while exposed to passive vibration (60 Hz, amplitude 4-6\
  \ mm) and performing 3-min of alpine skiing tuck position. Methods: Prior to, during\
  \ and following the experiment the electromygraphic (EMG) activity of different\
  \ muscles, cardio-respiratory data, changes in total hemoglobin, tissue oxygenation\
  \ and oscillatory movement of m. vastus lateralis, blood lactate and perceptual\
  \ data of 12 highly trained alpine skiers were recorded. Maximal isometric knee\
  \ extension and flexion strength, balance, and jumping performance were assessed\
  \ before and after the experiment. Results: The knee angle (-10\xB0) and oscillatory\
  \ movement (-20-25.5%) were lower with compression (P < 0.05 in all cases). The\
  \ EMG activities of the tibialis anterior (20.2-28.9%), gastrocnemius medialis (4.9-15.1%),\
  \ rectus femoris (9.6-23.5%), and vastus medialis (13.1-13.7%) muscles were all\
  \ elevated by compression (P < 0.05 in all cases). Total hemoglobin was maintained\
  \ during the 3-min period of simulated skiing with 20 or 40 mmHg compression, but\
  \ the tissue saturation index was lower (P < 0.05) than with no compression. No\
  \ differences in respiratory parameters, heart rate or blood lactate concentration\
  \ were observed with or maximal isometric knee extension and flexion strength, balance,\
  \ and jumping performance following simulated skiing for 3 min in the downhill tuck\
  \ position were the same as in the absence of compression. Conclusions: These findings\
  \ demonstrate that with leg compression, alpine skiers could maintain a deeper tuck\
  \ position with less perceived exertion and greater deoxygenation of the vastus\
  \ lateralis muscle, with no differences in whole-body oxygen consumption or blood\
  \ lactate concentration. These changes occurred without compromising maximal leg\
  \ strength, jumping performance or balance. Accordingly, our results indicate that\
  \ the use of lower leg compression in the range of 20-40 mmHg may improve alpine\
  \ skiing performance by allowing a deeper tuck position and lowering perceived exertion."
