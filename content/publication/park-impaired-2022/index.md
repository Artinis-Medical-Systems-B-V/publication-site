abstract: 'Ex vivo skeletal muscle arteriole endothelial function is impaired in claudicating
  patients with PAD, and this is associated with attenuated skeletal muscle mitochondrial
  respiration. In vivo skeletal muscle oxygen delivery and utilization capacity are
  compromised in PAD, and this may be due to microcirculatory and mitochondrial dysfunction.
  These results suggest that targeting skeletal muscle arteriole function may lead
  to improvements in skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration, oxygen delivery, and
  utilization capacity in claudicating patients with PAD. ,   Peripheral artery disease
  (PAD) is an atherosclerotic disease that impairs blood flow and muscle function
  in the lower limbs. A skeletal muscle myopathy characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction
  and oxidative damage is present in PAD; however, the underlying mechanisms are not
  well established. We investigated the impact of chronic ischemia on skeletal muscle
  microcirculatory function and its association with leg skeletal muscle mitochondrial
  function and oxygen delivery and utilization capacity in PAD. Gastrocnemius samples
  and arterioles were harvested from patients with PAD ( n = 10) and age-matched controls
  (Con, n = 11). Endothelium-dependent and independent vasodilation was assessed in
  response to flow (30 μL·min −1 ), acetylcholine, and sodium nitroprusside (SNP).
  Skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration was quantified by high-resolution respirometry,
  microvascular oxygen delivery, and utilization capacity (tissue oxygenation index,
  TOI) were assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy. Vasodilation was attenuated in
  PAD ( P textless 0.05) in response to acetylcholine (Con: 71.1 ± 11.1%, PAD: 45.7
  ± 18.1%) and flow (Con: 46.6 ± 20.1%, PAD: 29.3 ± 10.5%) but not SNP ( P = 0.30).
  Complex I + II state 3 respiration ( P textless 0.01) and TOI recovery rate were
  impaired in PAD ( P textless 0.05). Both flow and acetylcholine-mediated vasodilation
  were positively associated with complex I + II state 3 respiration ( r = 0.5 and
  r = 0.5, respectively, P textless 0.05). Flow-mediated vasodilation and complex
  I + II state 3 respiration were positively associated with TOI recovery rate ( r
  = 0.8 and r = 0.7, respectively, P textless 0.05). These findings suggest that chronic
  ischemia attenuates skeletal muscle arteriole endothelial function, which may be
  a key mediator for mitochondrial and microcirculatory dysfunction in the PAD leg
  skeletal muscle. Targeting microvascular dysfunction may be an effective strategy
  to prevent and/or reverse disease progression in PAD.  NEW & NOTEWORTHY Ex vivo
  skeletal muscle arteriole endothelial function is impaired in claudicating patients
  with PAD, and this is associated with attenuated skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration.
  In vivo skeletal muscle oxygen delivery and utilization capacity is compromised
  in PAD, and this may be due to microcirculatory and mitochondrial dysfunction. These
  results suggest that targeting skeletal muscle arteriole function may lead to improvements
  in skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration and oxygen delivery and utilization
  capacity in claudicating patients with PAD.'
