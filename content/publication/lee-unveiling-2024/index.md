abstract: The widespread use of mobile devices and laptops has replaced traditional
  paper-based learning and the question of how the brain efficiency of digital tablet-based
  learning differs from that of paper-based learning remains unclear. The purpose
  of this study was to investigate the difference in brain efficiency for learning
  between paper-based and digital tablet-based learning by measuring activity in the
  prefrontal cortex (PFC) using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Thirty-two
  subjects were randomly assigned to the paper-based learning or the digital tablet-based
  learning group. Subjects in each group performed a memory task that required memorizing
  a three-minute novel (encoding phase) on a paper or digital tablet, followed by
  a test in which they answered four multiple-choice questions based on the novelâ€™s
  content. To compare both groups, behavioral performance on the test (retrieval phase)
  and activity in the PFC were measured. As a result, no significant difference in
  behavioral performance between both groups was observed (p textgreater 0.05). However,
  the paper-based learning group showed significantly lower activity in the PFC in
  the encoding phase than the digital tablet-based learning group (p textless 0.05)
  but not in the retrieval phase. The current study demonstrated that brain efficiency
  in encoding is higher in subjects with paper-based learning than those with digital
  tablet-based learning. This finding has important implications for education, particularly
  in terms of the pros and cons of electronic document-based learning.
