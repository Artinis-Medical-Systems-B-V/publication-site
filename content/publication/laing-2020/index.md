abstract: "Key points: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of rotational\
  \ axis position (RAP and thus g-gradient) during short-arm human centrifugation\
  \ (SAHC) upon cardiovascular responses, cerebral perfusion and g-tolerance. In 10\
  \ male and 10 female participants, 10\_min passive SAHC runs were performed with\
  \ the RAP above the head (P1), at the apex of the head (P2), or at heart level (P3),\
  \ with foot-level Gz at 1.0\_g, 1.7\_g and 2.4\_g. We hypothesized that movement\
  \ of the RAP from above the head (the conventional position) towards the heart might\
  \ reduce central hypovolaemia, limit cardiovascular responses, aid cerebral perfusion,\
  \ and thus promote g-tolerance. Moving the RAP footward towards the heart decreased\
  \ the cerebral tissue saturation index, calf circumference and heart rate responses\
  \ to SAHC, thereby promoting g-tolerance. Our results also suggest that RAP, and\
  \ thus g-gradient, warrants further investigation as it may support use as a holistic\
  \ spaceflight countermeasure. Abstract: Artificial gravity (AG) through short-arm\
  \ human centrifugation (SAHC) has been proposed as a holistic spaceflight countermeasure.\
  \ Movement of the rotational axis position (RAP) from above the head towards the\
  \ heart may reduce central hypovolaemia, aid cerebral perfusion, and thus promote\
  \ g-tolerance. This study determined the effect of RAP upon cardiovascular responses,\
  \ peripheral blood displacement (i.e. central hypovolaemia), cerebral perfusion\
  \ and g-tolerance, and their inter-relationships. Twenty (10 male) healthy participants\
  \ (26.2\_\xB1\_4.0\_years) underwent nine (following a familiarization run) randomized\
  \ 10\_min passive SAHC runs with RAP set above the head (P1), at the apex of the\
  \ head (P2), or at heart level (P3) with foot-level Gz at 1.0\_g, 1.7\_g and 2.4\_\
  g. Cerebral tissue saturation index (cTSI, cerebral perfusion surrogate), calf circumference\
  \ (CC, central hypovolaemia), heart rate (HR) and digital heart-level mean arterial\
  \ blood pressure (MAP) were continuously recorded, in addition to incidence of pre-syncopal\
  \ symptoms (PSS). $\u0394$CC and $\u0394$HR increases were attenuated from P1 to\
  \ P3 ($\u0394$CC: 5.46\_\xB1\_0.54\_mm to 2.23\_\xB1\_0.42\_mm; $\u0394$HR: 50\_\
  \xB1\_4\_bpm to 8\_\xB1\_2\_bpm, P\_'\_0.05). In addition, $\u0394$cTSI decrements\
  \ were also attenuated ($\u0394$cTSI: \u22122.85\_\xB1\_0.48% to \u22120.95\_\xB1\
  \_0.34%, P\_'\_0.05) and PSS incidence lower in P3 than P1 (P\_'\_0.05). A positive\
  \ linear relationship was observed between $\u0394$CC and $\u0394$HR with increasing\
  \ +Gz, and a negative relationship between $\u0394$CC and $\u0394$cTSI, both independent\
  \ of RAP. Our data suggest that movement of RAP towards the heart (reduced g-gradient),\
  \ independent of foot-level Gz, leads to improved g-tolerance. Further investigations\
  \ are required to assess the effect of differential baroreceptor feedback (i.e.\
  \ aortic\u2013carotid g-gradient)."
