abstract: "The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of 30-min voluntary\
  \ hyperpnoea on cerebral, respiratory and leg muscle balance between O2 delivery\
  \ and utilization during a subsequent constant-power test. Eight males performed\
  \ a V\u0307O2max test, and two exercise tests at 85% of peak power output: (a) a\
  \ control constant-power test (CPT), and (b) a constant-power test after a respiratory\
  \ maneuver (CPTRM). Oxygenated ($\u0394$[O2Hb]), deoxygenated ($\u0394$[HHb]) and\
  \ total ($\u0394$[tHb]) hemoglobin in cerebral, intercostal and vastus lateralis\
  \ were monitored with near-infrared spectroscopy. The performance time dropped \u223C\
  15% in CPTRM (6:55\xB12:52min) compared to CPT (8:03\xB12:33min), but the difference\
  \ was not statistically significant. The vastus lateralis and intercostal $\u0394\
  $[tHb] and $\u0394$[HHb] were lower in CPTRM than in CPT (P\u22640.05). There were\
  \ no differences in cerebral oxygenation between the trials. Thus, respiratory work\
  \ prior to an exercise test influences the oxygenation during exercise in the leg\
  \ and respiratory muscles, but not in the frontal cortex. \xA9 2010 Elsevier B.V."
