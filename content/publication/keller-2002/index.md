abstract: "Indocyanine green (ICG) has excellent safety records and is widely used\
  \ in medical diagnosis. Recently, a new method has been developed to estimate cerebral\
  \ blood flow (CBF) using ICG in combination with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).\
  \ The new technique may be of wide clinical interest, as it is noninvasive and easy\
  \ to perform at the bedside in stroke patients. Additionally, ICG with the use of\
  \ specific wavelength lasers is documented to be effective in photodynamic therapy\
  \ (PDT). Under normal conditions ICG does not cross the intact blood brain barrier\
  \ (BBB). However, in patients with brain injuries where the BBB may be disturbed,\
  \ ICG could accumulate in brain parenchyma and in combination with NIR-light exposure,\
  \ phototoxicity could occur. The aim of the present study was to examine the possible\
  \ toxicity of ICG in combination with NIRS in a specific setting for CBF measurements.\
  \ In five rats with mannitol induced BBB breakdown no traces of ICG were found during\
  \ spectrophotometric analysis of the brain cell suspensions. In ten rats with disrupted\
  \ BBB there were no significant increases of brain temperature or histological signs\
  \ of brain damage following 1 h NIR-light exposure after ICG injection. The existing\
  \ literature concerning the application of ICG in combination with NIR light is\
  \ reviewed. \xA9 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."
