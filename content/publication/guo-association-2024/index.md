abstract: 'Background: Language delay affects near- and long-term social communication
  and learning in toddlers, and, an increasing number of experts pay attention to
  it. The development of prosody discrimination is one of the earliest stages of language
  development in which key skills for later stages are mastered. Therefore, analyzing
  the relationship between brain discrimination of speech prosody and language abilities
  may provide an objective basis for the diagnosis and intervention of language delay.
  Methods: In this study, all cases(n = 241) were enrolled from a tertiary women’s
  hospital, from 2021 to 2022. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
  to assess children’s neural prosody discrimination abilities, and a Chinese communicative
  development inventory (CCDI) were used to evaluate their language abilities. Results:
  Ninety-eight full-term and 108 preterm toddlers were included in the final analysis
  in phase I and II studies, respectively. The total CCDI screening abnormality rate
  was 9.2% for full-term and 34.3% for preterm toddlers. Full-term toddlers showed
  prosody discrimination ability in all channels except channel 5, while preterm toddlers
  showed prosody discrimination ability in channel 6 only. Multifactorial logistic
  regression analyses showed that prosody discrimination of the right angular gyrus
  (channel 3) had a statistically significant effect on language delay (odd ratio = 0.301,
  P textless 0.05) in full-term toddlers. Random forest (RF) regression model presented
  that prosody discrimination reflected by channels and brain regions based on fNIRS
  data was an important parameter for predicting language delay in preterm toddlers,
  among which the prosody discrimination reflected by the right angular gyrus (channel
  4) was the most important parameter. The area under the model Receiver operating
  characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.687. Conclusions: Neural prosody discrimination
  ability is positively associated with language development, assessment of brain
  prosody discrimination abilities through fNIRS could be used as an objective indicator
  for early identification of children with language delay in the future clinical
  application.'
