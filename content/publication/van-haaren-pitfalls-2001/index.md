abstract: "In the past decade, advances in the surgical management of children with\
  \ severe congenital heart disease (CHD) have led to a dramatic improvement in survival.\
  \ The greatest impact of these advances has been on neonates with complex, and what\
  \ previously would have been lethal, heart disease. However, there are an increasing\
  \ number of reports on adverse neurologic outcomes in neonates and infants after\
  \ this kind of operation, ranging from mild neuropsychologic deficits, detectable\
  \ only by means of sensitive tests, to gross damage, resulting in persisting vegetative\
  \ state or death.1 , 2 , 3 The awareness that improved survival comes at the cost\
  \ of substantial neurologic morbidity has been an incentive for extensive research\
  \ in this field. Some lifesaving surgical procedures are impossible without deep\
  \ hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA), but this procedure has been linked with\
  \ neurologic sequelae. Although the duration of \u201Csafe DHCA\u201D remains unknown,\
  \ adverse outcomes are more frequently observed in children with a DHCA duration\
  \ exceeding 45 minutes.4 Various strategies for preventing neurologic problems and\
  \ allowing the surgeon more time for optimal repair and hemostasis have been developed.\
  \ One of the most promising is low-flow antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP).5 This\
  \ technique has been successfully applied in adults and is being introduced in neonatal\
  \ aortic surgery."
