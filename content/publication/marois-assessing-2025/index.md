abstract: Exposure to nature can help recover cognitive fatigue by enhancing working
  memory, attention control, and cognitive flexibility. However, these effects may
  be impacted by multiple confounding variables, including engagement level and baseline
  differences. Additionally, it remains unclear whether changes in objective restoration
  measures may extend to perceived fatigue as well. This study examined whether nature
  could reduce cognitive fatigue while controlling for initial fatigue levels and
  using a set of objective and subjective outcomes. Participants performed working
  memory and attention control tasks at pretest and posttest. Between these tests,
  they went through a cognitive fatigue task, followed by exposure to either nature
  or urban pictures on a computer. Measures of subjective fatigue, performance, and
  prefrontal cerebral activity were collected. While performance and neurophysiological
  measures were similar across conditions, nature exposure improved subjective fatigue
  reports, unlike urban exposure. This finding highlights how subjective and objective
  experiences of attention restoration may differ.
