abstract: "Background: Drinks with higher dissolved oxygen concentrations have in\
  \ recent times gained popularity as a potential ergogenic aid, despite a lack of\
  \ evidence regarding their efficacy. The aim of this study was to assess effects\
  \ of ingestion of an oxygen supplement (OS) on exercise performance and post-exercise\
  \ recovery in a group of trained runners. Methods: Trained male runners (n = 25,\
  \ mean \xB1 SD; age 23 \xB1 6 years, mass 70 \xB1 9 kg, BMI 21.9 \xB1 2.7 kg.m-2\
  \ VO2max 64 \xB1 6mL.kg-1.min-1), completed a randomised double blinded, crossover\
  \ study to assess the effect of ingestion of OS solution on exercise performance\
  \ and recovery. Trials consisted of a 30min rest period, 5min warm-up, a 5000m treadmill\
  \ time-trial, and a 30min passive recovery. Participants ingested 6x15mL of either\
  \ OS or a taste matched placebo during the trials (3 during the rest phase, 1 during\
  \ exercise and 2 during the recovery). Muscle tissue O2 saturation was measured\
  \ via near infrared spectroscopy. Blood lactate concentrations were measured prior\
  \ to, mid-way and directly after the finish of the 5000m time trials and every 3-min\
  \ during the post-exercise recovery. Results: Ingestion of OS did not improve exercise\
  \ performance. No significant differences were observed for muscle tissue O2 saturation\
  \ at any time-points. However, lactate clearance was significantly improved during\
  \ recovery in the OS trials. Both AUC (109 \xB1 32 vs. 123 \xB1 38 mmol.min, P <\
  \ 0.05, d = 0.40) and lactate half-life ($\u0142ambda$) (1127 \xB1 272 vs. 1223\
  \ \xB1 334 s, P < 0.05, d = 0.32) were significantly reduced. Conclusions: Despite\
  \ no evidence of improved exercise performance, ingestion of OS did enhance post-exercise\
  \ recovery via increased lactate clearance."
