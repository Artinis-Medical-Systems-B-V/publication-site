abstract: 'Background: functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an increasingly
  popular tool to study cortical activity during movement and gait that requires further
  validation. This study aimed to assess (1) whether fNIRS can detect the difficult-to-measure
  leg area of the primary motor cortex (M1) and distinguish it from the hand area;
  and (2) whether fNIRS can differentiate between automatic (i.e., not requiring one''s
  attention) and non-automatic movement processes. Special attention was attributed
  to systemic artifacts (i.e., changes in blood pressure, heart rate, breathing) which
  were assessed and corrected by short channels, i.e., fNIRS channels which are mainly
  sensitive to superficial scalp hemodynamics.  Methods: Twenty-three seated, healthy
  participants tapped four fingers on a keyboard or tapped the right foot on four
  squares on the floor in a specific order given by a 12-digit sequence (e.g., 434141243212).
  Two different sequences were executed: a beforehand learned (i.e., automatic) version
  and a newly learned (i.e., non-automatic) version. A 36-channel fNIRS device including
  12 short channels covered multiple motor-related cortical areas including M1. The
  fNIRS data were analyzed with a general linear model (GLM). Correlation between
  the expected functional hemodynamic responses (i.e. task regressor) and the short
  channels (i.e. nuisance regressors), necessitated performing a separate short channel
  regression instead of integrating them in the GLM.  Results: Consistent with the
  M1 somatotopy, we found significant HbO increases of very large effect size in the
  lateral M1 channels during finger tapping (Cohen''s d = 1.35, ptextless0.001) and
  significant HbO increases of moderate effect size in the medial M1 channels during
  foot tapping (Cohen''s d = 0.8, ptextless0.05). The cortical activity differences
  between automatic and non-automatic tasks were not significantly different. Importantly,
  leg movements produced large systemic fluctuations, which were adequately removed
  by the use of all available short channels.  Discussion: Our results indicate that
  fNIRS is sensitive to leg activity in M1, though the sensitivity is lower than for
  finger activity and requires rigorous correction for systemic fluctuations. We furthermore
  highlight that systemic artifacts may result in an unreliable GLM analysis when
  short channels show signals that are similar to the expected hemodynamic responses.'
