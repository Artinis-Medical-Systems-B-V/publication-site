abstract: "Purpose: The recovery of muscle oxygen consumption (mV\u02D9 O2) after\
  \ exercise provides a measure of skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity, as more\
  \ and better-functioning mitochondria will be able to restore mV\u02D9 O2 faster\
  \ to the pre-exercise state. The aim was to measure muscle mitochondrial capacity\
  \ using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) within a healthy, normally active population\
  \ and relate this to parameters of aerobic fitness, investigating the applicability\
  \ and relevance of using NIRS to assess muscle mitochondrial capacity non-invasively.\
  \ Methods: Mitochondrial capacity was analysed in the gastrocnemius and flexor digitorum\
  \ superficialis (FDS) muscles of eight relatively high-aerobic fitness (V\u02D9\
  \ O2peak \u2265 57\_mL/kg/min) and eight relatively low-aerobic fitness male subjects\
  \ (V\u02D9 O2peak \u2264 47\_mL/kg/min). Recovery of whole body V\u02D9 O2, i.e.\
  \ excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) was analysed after a cycling protocol.\
  \ Results: Mitochondrial capacity, as analysed using NIRS, was significantly higher\
  \ in high-fitness individuals compared to low-fitness individuals in the gastrocnemius,\
  \ but not in the FDS (p = 0.0036 and p = 0.20, respectively). Mitochondrial capacity\
  \ in the gastrocnemius was significantly correlated with V\u02D9 O2peak (R2 = 0.57,\
  \ p = 0.0019). Whole body V\u02D9 O2 recovery was significantly faster in the high-fitness\
  \ individuals (p = 0.0048), and correlated significantly with mitochondrial capacity\
  \ in the gastrocnemius (R2 = 0.34, p = 0.028). Conclusion: NIRS measurements can\
  \ be used to assess differences in mitochondrial muscle oxygen consumption within\
  \ a relatively normal, healthy population. Furthermore, mitochondrial capacity correlated\
  \ with parameters of aerobic fitness (V\u02D9 O2peak and EPOC), emphasising the\
  \ physiological relevance of the NIRS measurements."
