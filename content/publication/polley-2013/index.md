abstract: "Physical inactivity reduces, and exercise training increases, mitochondrial\
  \ capacity. In rodents, exercise training effects can be augmented by large doses\
  \ of resveratrol supplementation but whether this can occur in humans with a smaller\
  \ dose is unclear. This study sought to determine the effects of resveratrol supplementation\
  \ in combination with exercise training on skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity.\
  \ Sixteen healthy young adults were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion\
  \ to consume either placebo or 500 mg of resveratrol plus 10 mg of piperine, a bioenhancer\
  \ to increase bioavailibilty and bioefficacy of resveratrol. Participants ingested\
  \ the pills daily for 4 weeks and completed 3 sessions per week of submaximal endurance\
  \ training of the wrist flexor muscles of the nondominant arm. The contralateral\
  \ arm served as an untrained control. Skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity was\
  \ measured using near-infrared spectroscopy. Changes in mitochondrial capacity from\
  \ baseline to post-testing indicated significant differences between the resveratrol+piperine-trained\
  \ arm and the placebo-trained arm (p = 0.02), with the resveratrol+piperine group\
  \ increasing about 40% from baseline ($\u0394$k = 0.58), while the placebo group\
  \ increased about 10% from baseline ($\u0394$k = 0.13). Neither the placebo group\
  \ nor the resveratrol+piperine group exhibited changes in mitochondrial capacity\
  \ in the untrained arm. In conclusion, low-intensity exercise training can increase\
  \ forearm skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity when combined with resveratrol\
  \ and piperine supplementation."
