abstract: "\xA9 2017 Optical Society of America. Functional near infrared spectroscopy\
  \ (fNIRS) is a promising neuroimaging method for investigating networks of cortical\
  \ regions over time. We propose a directed effective connectivity method (TPDC)\
  \ allowing the capture of both time and frequency evolution of the brain's networks\
  \ using fNIRS data acquired from healthy subjects performing a continuous finger-tapping\
  \ task. Using this method we show the directed connectivity patterns among cortical\
  \ motor regions involved in the task and their significant variations in the strength\
  \ of information flow exchanges. Intra and inter-hemispheric connections during\
  \ the motor task with their temporal evolution are also provided. Characterisation\
  \ of the fluctuations in brain connectivity opens up a new way to assess the organisation\
  \ of the brain to adapt to changing task constraints, or under pathological conditions."
