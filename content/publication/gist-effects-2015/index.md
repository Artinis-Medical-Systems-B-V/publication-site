abstract: "Our objective was to determine the effects of high-intensity interval training\
  \ (HIT) on fitness in Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps cadets. Twenty-six college-aged\
  \ (20.5 \xB1 1.7 years) participants completed 4 weeks of exercise training 3 days\u2219\
  wk\u22121 consisting of either approximately 60 minutes of typical physical training\
  \ or HIT wholebody calisthenics involving 4 to 7 sets of 30-second \u201Call out\u201D\
  \ burpees separated by 4 minutes of active recovery. Several pre- and postintervention\
  \ fitness variables were compared. We observed no changes across time or differences\
  \ between groups in aerobic capacity, anaerobic capacity, or Army Physical Fitness\
  \ Test performance (p > 0.05). However, there was a significant Group \xD7 Time\
  \ interaction (p = 0.015) for skeletal muscle mitochondrial function (Tc: time constant\
  \ of recovery). For the typical physical training group, we observed improved mitochondrial\
  \ function (Tc decreased 2.4 \xB1 4.6 seconds; Cohen's d = \u22120.51); whereas,\
  \ mitochondrial function decreased in HIT (Tc increased 2.4 \xB1 4.6 seconds; d\
  \ = 0.50). HIT sustained fitness despite the short duration and reduced volume of\
  \ activity. A program that includes HIT as part of a larger program may be well\
  \ suited for maintaining fitness in moderately trained armed forces personnel without\
  \ access to equipment."
