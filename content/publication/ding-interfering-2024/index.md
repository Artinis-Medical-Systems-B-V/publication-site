abstract: The rapid growth of the construction industry has led to significant environmental
  issues, notably the sharp escalation in construction waste. Recent endeavors have
  prioritized on recycling and reusing of construction waste. Nevertheless, despite
  the evident public support, the adoption of recycled products remains constrained,
  primarily as a result of subsequent unfavorable implicit perceptions. To understand
  the end usersâ€™ implicit attitudes, this study employed a Single-Category Implicit
  Association Test (SC-IAT) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) for
  analysis. The experiment results confirm the existence of detrimental implicit attitudes,
  even as self-reported attitudes remained positive. The experiment results, D-scores,
  suggest that emotional interventions have stronger impact as they reach peak (15.9s)
  36% faster that the rational interventions. The proposed implicit attitude measurement
  approach can be extended to understand and promote other green products and recycled
  materials.
