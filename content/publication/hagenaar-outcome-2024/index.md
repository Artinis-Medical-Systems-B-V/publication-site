abstract: 'Background: Angelman syndrome (AS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder
  characterized by severe intellectual disability, little to no expressive speech,
  visual and motor problems, emotional/behavioral challenges, and a tendency towards
  hyperphagia and weight gain. The characteristics of AS make it difficult to measure
  these children’s functioning with standard clinical tests. Feasible outcome measures
  are needed to measure current functioning and change over time, in clinical practice
  and clinical trials. Aim: Our first aim is to assess the feasibility of several
  functional tests. We target domains of neurocognitive functioning and physical growth
  using the following measurement methods: eye-tracking, functional Near-Infrared
  Spectroscopy (fNIRS), indirect calorimetry, bio-impedance analysis (BIA), and BOD
  POD (air-displacement plethysmography). Our second aim is to explore the results
  of the above measures, in order to better understand the AS phenotype. Methods:
  The study sample consisted of 28 children with AS aged 2–18 years. We defined an
  outcome measure as feasible when (1) at least 70% of participants successfully finished
  the measurement and (2) at least 60% of those participants had acceptable data quality.
  Adaptations to the test procedure and reasons for early termination were noted.
  Parents rated acceptability and importance and were invited to make recommendations
  to increase feasibility. The results of the measures were explored. Results: Outcome
  measures obtained with eye-tracking and BOD POD met the definition of feasibility,
  while fNIRS, indirect calorimetry, and BIA did not. The most important reasons for
  early termination of measurements were showing signs of protest, inability to sit
  still and poor/no calibration (eye-tracking specific). Post-calibration was often
  applied to obtain valid eye-tracking results. Parents rated the BOD POD als most
  acceptable and fNIRS as least acceptable for their child. All outcome measures were
  rated to be important. Exploratory results indicated longer reaction times to high
  salient visual stimuli (eye-tracking) as well as high body fat percentage (BOD POD).
  Conclusions: Eye-tracking and BOD POD are feasible measurement methods for children
  with AS. Eye-tracking was successfully used to assess visual orienting functions
  in the current study and (with some practical adaptations) can potentially be used
  to assess other outcomes as well. BOD POD was successfully used to examine body
  composition.'
