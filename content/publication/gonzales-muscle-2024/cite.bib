 abstract = {Objective: To verify peripheral muscle oxygenation and quality of life (QoL) in male patients with heart failure (HF) during a submaximal physical capacity test. Methods: Cross-sectional study, in individuals with HF, functional class II or III, left ventricular ejection fraction \textless45%, divided into sedentary group (SG) and cardiovascular rehabilitation group (CRG). QoL was assessed by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, muscle oxygenation by near-infrared spectroscopy before, during and after the six-minute walk test. Inferential statistical tests were used with a significance level of 5%, according to the normality test. The correlation analysis was performed through the Spearman correlation test. Results: There were inversely proportional results between physical aspects of QoL and oxyhemoglobin in the SG group. The distance covered was greater for CRG. We noted a significant increase in oxyhemoglobin post-test for CRG. Conclusions: Oxygen measurements correlate with physical aspects related to QoL in individuals with heart failure and the dynamics of peripheral muscle oxygenation in the most appropriate kinetic subjects.},
