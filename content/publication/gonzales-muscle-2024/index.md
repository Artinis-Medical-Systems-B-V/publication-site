abstract: 'Objective: To verify peripheral muscle oxygenation and quality of life
  (QoL) in male patients with heart failure (HF) during a submaximal physical capacity
  test. Methods: Cross-sectional study, in individuals with HF, functional class II
  or III, left ventricular ejection fraction textless45%, divided into sedentary group
  (SG) and cardiovascular rehabilitation group (CRG). QoL was assessed by the Minnesota
  Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, muscle oxygenation by near-infrared spectroscopy
  before, during and after the six-minute walk test. Inferential statistical tests
  were used with a significance level of 5%, according to the normality test. The
  correlation analysis was performed through the Spearman correlation test. Results:
  There were inversely proportional results between physical aspects of QoL and oxyhemoglobin
  in the SG group. The distance covered was greater for CRG. We noted a significant
  increase in oxyhemoglobin post-test for CRG. Conclusions: Oxygen measurements correlate
  with physical aspects related to QoL in individuals with heart failure and the dynamics
  of peripheral muscle oxygenation in the most appropriate kinetic subjects.'
