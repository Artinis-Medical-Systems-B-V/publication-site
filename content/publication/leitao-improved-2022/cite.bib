 abstract = {Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the effects of AGE on microvascular reactivity, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in older individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Urinary thiosulfate was also investigated as an indirect marker of endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) synthesis. The study was conducted in a randomized, double-blind, crossover, and placebo-controlled way.

Methods: Twenty-eight participants (14 male), 67 ± 6 years old with CVD risk factors, ingested 2.4 g of AGE or placebo (PLA). Near-infrared spectroscopy evaluated tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) during a vascular occlusion test (30 s baseline, 5 min occlusion, and 2 min reperfusion). The upslope of StO2 signal after cuff release was calculated to measure microvascular reactivity. Urinary thiosulfate levels were measured using a high-performance liquid chromatography system.

Results: The upslope of StO2 was significantly faster after AGE (1.01 ± 0.37% s-1) intake compared to PLA (0.83 ± 0.35% s-1; P \textless 0.001; d = 0.50). Relative changes in Δ% SBP from pre- to post-AGE intake (- 5.17 ± 5.77%) was significantly different compared to Δ% PLA (0.32 ± 5.99%; P = 0.001; d = 0.93). No significant changes in urinary thiosulfate concentrations were observed between interventions. Moreover, no significant gender effect in any parameter assessed was found.

Conclusion: This study demonstrated that a single dose of AGE improved microvascular reactivity in older adults at risk of CVD despite such an effect was not linked with urinary thiosulfate levels. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT04008693 (May 19, 2020).},
