abstract: 'Background: Cerebral vasculopathy can induce chronic cerebral hypoperfusion
  leading to stroke in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and is treated by blood
  exchange transfusion (BET). However, no prospective clinical study has demonstrated
  the benefit of BET in adults with SCD and cerebral vasculopathy. Near Infrared Spectroscopy
  (NIRS) is a recent non-invasive method complementary to Magnetic Resonance Imaging
  (MRI). We evaluated cerebral perfusion using NIRS during erythracytapheresis in
  patients with SCD with and without steno-occlusive arterial disease. Methods: We
  conducted a monocentric, prospective study in 16 adults with SCD undergoing erythracytapheresis
  in 2014. Among them, 10 had cerebral steno-occlusive arterial disease. NIRS measured
  the relative amounts of oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb), deoxyhemoglobin (DeoxyHb) and total
  hemoglobin (Total Hb) in brain tissue and in muscle. Results: In cerebral hemispheres
  associated with steno-occlusive arterial disease, we observed a significant increase
  of OxyHb and Total Hb during BET, without modification of DeoxyHb. Conclusion: Using
  NIRS during BET showed that BET improves cerebral perfusion in adult patients with
  SCD with cerebral vasculopathy.'
