abstract: Chronic pain (CP) has been found to cause significant alternations of the
  brainâ€™s structure and function due to changes in pain processing and disrupted cognitive
  functions, including with respect to the prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, until
  now, no studies have used a wearable, low-cost neuroimaging tool capable of performing
  functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to explore the functional alternations
  of the PFC and thus automatically achieve a clinical diagnosis of CP. In this case-control
  study, the pain characteristics of 19 chronic pain patients and 32 healthy controls
  were measured using fNIRS. Functional connectivity (FC), FC in the PFC, and spontaneous
  brain activity of the PFC were examined in the CP patients and compared to those
  of healthy controls (HCs). Then, leave-one-out cross-validation and machine learning
  algorithms were used to automatically achieve a diagnosis corresponding to a CP
  patient or an HC. The current study found significantly weaker FC, notably higher
  small-worldness properties of FC, and increased spontaneous brain activity during
  resting state within the PFC. Additionally, the resting-state fNIRS measurements
  exhibited excellent performance in identifying the chronic pain patients via supervised
  machine learning, achieving F1 score of 0.8229 using only seven features. It is
  expected that potential FC features can be identified, which can thus serve as a
  neural marker for the detection of CP using machine learning algorithms. Therefore,
  the present study will open a new avenue for the diagnosis of chronic musculoskeletal
  pain by using fNIRS and machine learning techniques.
