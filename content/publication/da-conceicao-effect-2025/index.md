abstract: 'Impaired balance is one of the most disabling symptoms in people with Parkinson’s
  disease (PwPD). While motor intervention can improve balance control, its effects
  might be enhanced through cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (ctDCS).
  However, the optimal stimulation intensity remains a point open to investigation.
  To compare the effects of dynamic balance training combined with different intensities
  of anodal ctDCS on improvements in body balance and modulation of prefrontal cortex
  (PFC) activation in PwPD. Thirty-three PwPD were randomized into three groups varying
  in the intensity of ctDCS (4 mA, 2 mA, Sham) in a double-blind, sham-controlled
  design. Participants underwent 6 sessions of progressively challenging dynamic balance
  training combined with ctDCS/sham. Balance improvements were assessed through center
  of pressure excursion in quiet standing and dynamic transfer tasks. Training-related
  effects were also evaluated in PFC activation using functional near-infrared spectroscopy.
  Balance training combined with ctDCS led to higher improvements in balance compared
  to training without cerebellar stimulation. The 4 mA stimulation intensity led to
  greater balance gains than the 2 mA and sham stimulation across all transfer task
  categories assessed. Balance training led to decreased PFC activation, with no detectable
  differences between the groups. Six sessions of dynamic balance training combined
  with the ctDCS intensity of 4 mA resulted in superior improvement of balance in
  PwPD. Balance training led to decreased PFC activation in the performance of different
  transfer tasks regardless of the ctDCS condition. Brazilian Registry of Clinical
