abstract: "The Corsi Block-Tapping test (CBT) is a measure of spatial working memory\
  \ (WM) in clinical practice, requiring an examinee to reproduce sequences of cubes\
  \ tapped by an examiner. CBT implies complementary behaviors in the examiners and\
  \ the examinees, as they have to attend a precise turn taking. Previous studies\
  \ demonstrated that the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) is activated during CBT, but scarce\
  \ evidence is available on the neural correlates of CBT in the real setting. We\
  \ assessed PFC activity in dyads of examiner\u2013examinee participants while completing\
  \ the real version of CBT, during conditions of increasing and exceeding workload.\
  \ This procedure allowed to investigate whether brain activity in the dyads is coordinated.\
  \ Results in the examinees showed that PFC activity was higher when the workload\
  \ approached or reached participants' spatial WM span, and lower during workload\
  \ conditions that were largely below or above their span. Interestingly, findings\
  \ in the examiners paralleled the ones in the examinees, as examiners' brain activity\
  \ increased and decreased in a similar way as the examinees' one. In the examiners,\
  \ higher left-hemisphere activity was observed suggesting the likely activation\
  \ of non-spatial WM processes. Data support a bell-shaped relationship between cognitive\
  \ load and brain activity, and provide original insights on the cognitive processes\
  \ activated in the examiner during CBT."
