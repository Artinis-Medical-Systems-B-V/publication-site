abstract: "Introduction: Mobility declines with age and further with neurodegenerative\
  \ disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Walking and turning ability, in particular,\
  \ are vital aspects of mobility that deteriorate with age and are further impaired\
  \ in PD. Such deficits have been linked with reduction in automatic control of movement\
  \ and the need for compensatory cognitive cortical control via the pre-frontal cortex\
  \ (PFC), however the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. Establishing and\
  \ using a robust methodology to examine PFC activity during continuous walking and\
  \ turning via mobile functional near infra-red spectroscopy (fNIRS) may aid in the\
  \ understanding of mobility deficits and help with development of appropriate therapeutics.\
  \ This study aimed to: (1) examine test re-test reliability of PFC activity during\
  \ continuous turning and walking via fNIRS measurement; and (2) compare PFC activity\
  \ during continuous turning and walking in young, old and Parkinson's subjects.\
  \ Methods: Twenty-five young (32.3 \xB1 7.5 years), nineteen older (65.4 \xB1 7.0\
  \ years), and twenty-four PD (69.3 \xB1 4.1 years) participants performed continuous\
  \ walking and 360\xB0 turning-in-place tasks, each lasting 2 min. Young participants\
  \ repeated the tasks a second time to allow fNIRS measurement reliability assessment.\
  \ The primary outcome was PFC activity, assessed via measuring changes in oxygenated\
  \ hemoglobin (HbO2) concentrations. Results: PFC activity during continuous walking\
  \ and turning was moderately reproducible (Intra-class correlation coefficient =\
  \ 0.67). The PD group had higher PFC activation than young and older adults during\
  \ walking and turning, with significant group differences for bilateral PFC activation\
  \ (p = 0.025), left PFC activation (p = 0.012), and the early period (first 40 s)\
  \ of walking (p = 0.007), with greater activation required in PD. Interestingly,\
  \ older adults had similar PFC activation to young adults across conditions, however\
  \ older adults required greater activation than young adults during continuous turning,\
  \ specifically the early period of the turning task (Cohens d = 0.86). Conclusions:\
  \ PFC activity can be measured during continuous walking and turning tasks with\
  \ acceptable reliability, and can differentiate young, older and PD groups. PFC\
  \ activation was significantly greater in PD compared to young and older adults\
  \ during walking, particularly when beginning to walk."
