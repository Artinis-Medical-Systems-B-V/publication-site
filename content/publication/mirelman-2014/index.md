abstract: "Background: Accumulating evidence suggests that gait is influenced by higher\
  \ order cognitive and cortical control mechanisms. Recently, several studies used\
  \ functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to examine brain activity during\
  \ walking, demonstrating increased oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO 2) levels in the frontal\
  \ cortex during walking while subjects completed a verbal cognitive task. It is,\
  \ however, still unclear whether this increase in activation was related to verbalization,\
  \ if the response was specific to gait, or if it would also be observed during standing,\
  \ a different motor control task. The aim of this study was to investigate whether\
  \ an increase in frontal activation is specific to dual tasking during walking.\
  \ Methods. Twenty-three healthy young adults (mean 30.9 \xB1 3.7 yrs, 13 females)\
  \ were assessed using an electronic walkway. Frontal brain activation was assessed\
  \ using an fNIRS system consisting of two probes placed on the forehead of the subjects.\
  \ Assessments included: walking in a self-selected speed; walking while counting\
  \ forward; walking while serially subtracting 7s (Walking+S7); and standing while\
  \ serially subtracting 7s (Standing+S7). Data was collected from 5 walks of 30 meters\
  \ in each condition. Twenty seconds of quiet standing before each walk served as\
  \ baseline frontal lobe activity. Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (RM ANOVA)\
  \ tested for differences between the conditions. Results: Significant differences\
  \ were observed in HbO2 levels between all conditions (p = 0.007). HbO2 levels appeared\
  \ to be graded; walking alone demonstrated the lowest levels of HbO2 followed by\
  \ walking+counting condition (p = 0.03) followed by Walking+S7 condition significantly\
  \ increased compared to the two other walking conditions (p < 0.01). No significant\
  \ differences in HbO2 levels were observed between usual walking and the standing\
  \ condition (p = 0.38) or between standing with or without serial subtraction (p\
  \ = 0.76). Conclusions: This study provides direct evidence that dual tasking during\
  \ walking is associated with frontal brain activation in healthy young adults. The\
  \ observed changes are apparently not a response to the verbalization of words and\
  \ are related to the cognitive load during gait. \xA9 2014 Mirelman et al.; licensee\
