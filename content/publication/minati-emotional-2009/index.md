abstract: "Functional neuroimaging and electroencephalography reveal emotional effects\
  \ in the early visual cortex. Here, we used functional near-infrared spectroscopy\
  \ to examine haemodynamic responses evoked by neutral, positive and negative emotional\
  \ pictures, matched for brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, spatial frequency\
  \ and entropy. Emotion content modulated amplitude and latency of oxy, deoxy and\
  \ total haemoglobin response peaks, and induced peripheral autonomic reactions.\
  \ The processing of positive and negative pictures enhanced haemodynamic response\
  \ amplitude, and this effect was paralleled by blood pressure changes. The processing\
  \ of positive pictures was reflected in reduced haemodynamic response peak latency.\
  \ Together these data suggest that the early visual cortex holds amplitude-dependent\
  \ representation of stimulus salience and latency-dependent information regarding\
  \ stimulus valence, providing new insight into affective interaction with sensory\
  \ processing. \xA9 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc."
