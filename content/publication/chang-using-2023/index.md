abstract: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a vital emergency procedure
  providing respiratory and circulatory support to critically ill patients, especially
  those with compromised cardiopulmonary function. Its use has grown due to technological
  advances and clinical demand. Prolonged ECMO usage can lead to complications, necessitating
  the timely assessment of peripheral microcirculation for an accurate physiological
  evaluation. This study utilizes non-invasive near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to
  monitor knee-level microcirculation in ECMO patients. After processing oxygenation
  data, machine learning distinguishes high and low disease severity in the veno-venous
  (VV-ECMO) and veno-arterial (VA-ECMO) groups, with two clinical parameters enhancing
  the model performance. Both ECMO modes show promise in the clinical severity diagnosis.
  The research further explores statistical correlations between the oxygenation data
  and disease severity in diverse physiological conditions, revealing moderate correlations
  with the acute physiologic and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) scores in the
  VV-ECMO and VA-ECMO groups. NIRS holds the potential for assessing patient condition
  improvements.
