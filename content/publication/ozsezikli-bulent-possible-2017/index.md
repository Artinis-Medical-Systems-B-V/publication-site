abstract: Improvements in the treatment of stroke lead to an increase in the number
  of patients living with the consequences of stroke. Although stroke induces cognitive
  impairment, a lack in mobility or difficulties in walking are common problems for
  stroke survivors and restoring the walking pattern is one of the main targets in
  the rehabilitation procedures. Perturbation application is helpful in creating a
  suitable environment in gait training and it drives problem solving. In our study
  we aimed to investigate the instantaneous and direct effectiveness of perturbation
  in stroke patients on the brain during walking by using Near Infrared Spectroscopy
  (NIRS) and also evaluated the cognitive functions of these patients by Mini Mental
  Test and Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Study groups were composed of 6 healthy
  and 6 stroke survivors. Perturbation was applied to subjects by using Re-Step Rehabilitation
  System and NIRS was used to analyse the instant effect of perturbation on oxygen
  consumption dynamics of the brain. Although HHb did not change in both groups, HbO2
  value showed significant changes in healthy group during walking protocol of the
  study. Healthy Group Mini Mental Test score was found to be increased significantly
  when compared to Patient Group. We may suggest that the perturbation implantation
  increases the prefrontal circulation which is activated during motor planning and
  central input processing, especially in healthy group compared to stroke patients.
  This determination may consequently be thought as increase in activity in neural
  centers related to the task and parallel effect of plasticity.
