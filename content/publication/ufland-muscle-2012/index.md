abstract: "The aim of this study was to investigate the relative contribution of human\
  \ muscle reoxygenation on force recovery following a maximal voluntary contraction\
  \ (MVC). Ten athletes (22\u02D99 \xB1 4\u02D90 years) executed a plantar-flexion\
  \ sequence including two repeated MVCs [i.e. a 30-s MVC (MVC30) followed by a 10-s\
  \ MVC (MVC10)] separated by 10, 30, 60, 120 or 300 s of passive recovery. A 10-min\
  \ passive recovery period was allowed between each MVC sequence. This procedure\
  \ was randomly repeated with two different recovery conditions: without (CON) or\
  \ with (OCC) arterial occlusion of the medial gastrocnemius. During OCC, the occlusion\
  \ was maintained from the end of MVC30 to the end of MVC10. Muscle oxygenation (Near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy, NIRS, [Hbdiff]) was continuously measured during all MVC sequences\
  \ and expressed as a percentage of the maximal changes in optical density observed\
  \ during MVC30. Maximal Torque was analysed at the start of each contraction. Torque\
  \ during each MVC10 was expressed as a percentage of the Torque during the previous\
  \ MVC30. Torque recovery was complete within 300 s after MVC30 during CON (MVC10\
  \ = 101\u02D98 \xB1 5\u02D90%); 88\u02D96 \xB1 8\u02D99% of the Torque was recovered\
  \ during OCC (P = 0\u02D9005). There was also a moderate correlation between absolute\
  \ level of muscle oxygenation and Torque (r = 0\u02D932 (90% CI, 0\u02D909;0\u02D9\
  52), P = 0\u02D902). Present findings confirm the role of human muscle oxygenation\
  \ in muscular force recovery during repeated-maximal efforts. However, the correlation\
  \ between absolute muscle oxygenation and force level during recovery is only moderate,\
  \ suggesting that other mechanisms are likely involved in the force recovery process.\
