abstract: " The majority of in vivo applications of near-infrared spectroscopic (NIRS)\
  \ monitoring use continuous wave instruments that require a fiberoptic cable connection\
  \ between the subject and the instrument during monitoring. In studies of muscle\
  \ physiology where subjects are exercising, and particularly in those who are engaged\
  \ in sports activity, a wireless instrument with telemetric capacity provides obvious\
  \ advantages. Having access to reliable telemetric NIRS technology will also increase\
  \ the practicality and scope of this biomedical monitoring technique in clinical\
  \ settings.  We report the feasibility of using a wireless continuous wave NIRS\
  \ instrument with light emitting diodes, spatially resolved configuration, and Bluetooth\
  \ \xAE capability to study skeletal muscle oxygenation and hemodynamics during isometric\
  \ contraction and ischemia induction. In ten healthy subjects comparable patterns\
  \ of change in chromophore concentration (oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin),\
  \ total hemoglobin and muscle oxygen saturation were observed during 3 sets of isometric\
  \ voluntary forearm muscle contraction at 10, 30 and 50% of maximum voluntary capacity\
  \ (MVC), and a period of ischemia generated subsequently.This small series indicates\
  \ that data with good intra- and inter-subject reproducibility that is free of movement\
  \ artifact can be obtained with the wireless NIRS instrument described. The validity\
  \ of these muscle studies demonstrate a basis for applying wireless NIRS monitoring\
  \ to publisher-id biomedical applications."
