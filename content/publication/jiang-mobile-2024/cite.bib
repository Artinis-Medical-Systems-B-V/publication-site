 abstract = {Mobile near-infrared sensing is becoming an increasingly important method in many research and industrial areas. To help consolidate progress in this area, we use the PRISMA guidelines to conduct a systematic review of mobile near-infrared sensing, including 1) existing prototypes and commercial products; 2) data collection techniques; 3) machine learning methods; 4) relevant application areas. Our work measures historical and current trends, and identifies current challenges and future directions for this emerging topic.},
