abstract: Mobile near-infrared sensing is becoming an increasingly important method
  in many research and industrial areas. To help consolidate progress in this area,
  we use the PRISMA guidelines to conduct a systematic review of mobile near-infrared
  sensing, including 1) existing prototypes and commercial products; 2) data collection
  techniques; 3) machine learning methods; 4) relevant application areas. Our work
  measures historical and current trends, and identifies current challenges and future
  directions for this emerging topic.
