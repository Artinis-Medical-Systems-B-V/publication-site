abstract: Abstract For high-level automated vehicles, the human being acts as the
  passenger instead of the driver and does not need to operate vehicles, it makes
  the brain–computer interface system of high-level automated vehicles depend on the
  brain state of passengers rather than that of drivers. Particularly when confronting
  challenging driving situations, how to implement the mental states of passengers
  into safe driving is a vital choice in the future. Quantifying the cognition of
  the driving risk of the passenger is a basic step in achieving this goal. In this
  paper, the passengers’ mental activities in low-risk episode and high-risk episode
  were compared, the influences on passengers’ mental activities caused by driving
  scenario risk was first explored via fNIRS. The results showed that the mental activities
  of passengers caused by driving scenario risk in the Brodmann area 10 are very active,
  which was verified by examining the real-driving data collected in corresponding
  challenging experiments, and there is a positive correlation between the cerebral
  oxygen and the driving risk field. This initial finding provides a possible solution
  to design a human-centred intelligent system to promise safe driving for high-level
  automated vehicles using passengers’ driving risk cognition.
