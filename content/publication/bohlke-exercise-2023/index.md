abstract: Improving postural control in older adults is necessary for reducing fall
  risk, and prefrontal cortex activation may also play a role. We sought to examine
  the impact of exercise interventions on postural control and prefrontal cortex activation
  during standing balance tasks. We hypothesized that balance would improve and prefrontal
  control would be reduced. We assessed a subset of participants enrolled in a randomized
  trial of two exercise interventions. Both groups completed strength and endurance
  training and the experimental treatment arm included training on timing and coordination
  of stepping. Postural control and prefrontal cortex activation were measured during
  dual-task standing balance tasks before and after the intervention. Eighteen participants
  in the standard strengthening and mobility training arm and 16 in the timing and
  coordination training arm were included. We examined pre- to post-intervention changes
  within each study arm, and compared them between interventions. Results did not
  show any pre- to post-intervention changes on standing postural control nor prefrontal
  cortex activation in either arm. In addition, there were no differences between
  the two intervention arms in either balance or prefrontal activation. While exercise
  interventions can improve mobility, we do not demonstrate evidence of improved standing
  balance or prefrontal control in standing.
