abstract: "The magnitude and timing of oxygenation responses in highly active leg\
  \ muscle, less active arm muscle, and cerebral tissue, have not been studied with\
  \ simultaneous alveolar gas exchange measurement during incremental treadmill exercise.\
  \ Nor is it known, if blood O 2 carrying capacity affects the tissue-specific oxygenation\
  \ responses. Thus, we investigated alveolar gas exchange and tissue (m. vastus lateralis,\
  \ m. biceps brachii, cerebral cortex) oxygenation during incremental treadmill exercise\
  \ until volitional fatigue, and their associations with blood O 2 carrying capacity\
  \ in 22 healthy men. Alveolar gas exchange was measured, and near-infrared spectroscopy\
  \ (NIRS) was used to monitor relative concentration changes in oxy- ($\u0394$[O\
  \ 2Hb]), deoxy- ($\u0394$[HHb]) and total hemoglobin ($\u0394$[tHb]), and tissue\
  \ saturation index (TSI). NIRS inflection points (NIP), reflecting changes in tissue-specific\
  \ oxygenation, were determined and their coincidence with ventilatory thresholds\
  \ [anaerobic threshold (AT), respiratory compensation point (RC); V-slope method]\
  \ was examined. Blood O 2 carrying capacity [total hemoglobin mass (tHb-mass)] was\
  \ determined with the CO-rebreathing method. In all tissues, NIPs coincided with\
  \ AT whereas RC was followed by NIPs. High tHb-mass associated with leg muscle deoxygenation\
  \ at peak exercise (e.g., $\u0394$[HHb] from baseline walking to peak exercise vs.\
  \ tHb-mass: r = 0.64, p < 0.01), but not with arm muscle- or cerebral deoxygenation.\
  \ In conclusion, regional tissue oxygenation was characterized by inflection points,\
  \ and tissue oxygenation in relation to alveolar gas exchange during incremental\
  \ treadmill exercise resembled previous findings made during incremental cycling.\
  \ It was also found out, that O 2 delivery to less active m. biceps brachii may\
  \ be limited by an accelerated increase in ventilation at high running intensities.\
  \ In addition, high capacity for blood O 2 carrying was associated with a high level\
  \ of m. vastus lateralis deoxygenation at peak exercise. \xA9 2012 Rissanen, Tikkanen,\
