abstract: "Most research on the relationship between driver fatigue, driving comfort,\
  \ stability and other factors related to driving has consisted subjective assessments\
  \ via surveys. Bio-signal measurements allow more objective evaluations but the\
  \ measurement processes and types are very complicated, and measurement signals\
  \ are sensitive to noise. To address this issue, this paper attempts to quantify\
  \ driver fatigue by measuring and analyzing hemodynamic responses with near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy. The oxygen concentration changes in the erector spinae muscle were\
  \ measured for the same subjects when driving a vehicle on a highway for a long\
  \ time, in one of two driving postures: posture A based on the seat status of the\
  \ average male body type in South Korea (a 107.7\xB0 torso angle, 109.1\xB0 chair\
  \ back angle and 561.0\_mm seat x-axis position posture) and Posture B with the\
  \ chair back angle adjusted by \u221210\xB0 from posture A and the seat moved 4\_\
  cm back. A survey was carried out on the degree of lumbar discomfort. The analysis\
  \ of the degree of relative fatigue, based on driver posture utilizing a mathematical\
  \ model for the physiological system of lower-back fatigue, showed that posture\
  \ B is relatively uncomfortable compared to posture A by approximately 41%. The\
  \ results of analyzing the degree of relative discomfort with regard to driver posture\
  \ using a mathematical model allow the verification that interpreting the relative\
  \ degree of discomfort based on the changes in the oxygen concentration at a particular\
  \ time is possible, and the experimental results show the usefulness of the proposed\
  \ method."
