abstract: Geographically-distributed urban environment contexts affect human psychological
  wellbeing through the real-time interactions between individuals and their surroundings.
  Recent field experiments have become particularly interesting in using wearable
  devices for tracking episodic changes in wellbeing outcomes. However, most research
  primarily contribute to correlate unconscious physiological arousal with single
  environmental feature, ignoring the contextualized environment neural psychological
  effects at the brain level. This paper studies the effects of walking exposures
  to various urban environment contexts on neural physiological and psychological
  parameters relevant to mental health in women cohorts. We measure neural physiological
  parameters using a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) monitoring approach
  to detect brain activity variability during a journey-based field experiment, and
  perceived psychological wellbeing outcomes are measured through emotional questionnaires.
  A group of 10 healthy women walked across dense and diverse urban settings in Guangzhou,
  China. We have identified the beneficial effects of blue-green spaces and open spaces
  on psychological wellbeing, as well as their underlying neurophysiological mechanisms
  that exhibit localized context differentiation. Additional results quantify evidence
  in support of spatial typology and travel sequence-based uncertainties as underlying
  channels at work. Our study provide a walking-oriented investigation model of locally
  contextualized mental health effects, and expand explanatory method for walking
  mental health. It also suggests the importance of conceptualizing landscape complementarities
  in planning policies that help to improve the interaction between wellbeing and
  localized environmental exposures.
