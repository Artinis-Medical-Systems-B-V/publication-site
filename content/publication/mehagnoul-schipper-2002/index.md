abstract: "Elderly patients with heart failure are at risk of postprandial hypotension\
  \ (PPH), orthostatic hypotension (OH), and concomitant cerebral oxygenation changes\
  \ because of altered cardiovascular balance and the use of cardiovascular medications,\
  \ such as furosemide and captopril. In 24 patients with heart failure (New York\
  \ Heart Association class II to III, in stable condition, and receiving cardiovascular\
  \ medication [aged 70 to 83 years]), blood pressure (BP) was measured by Finapres,\
  \ and cortical concentrations of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin were measured\
  \ using near-infrared spectroscopy during standing and after a 292-kcal carbohydrate\
  \ meal. Tests were performed before and during therapy with furosemide 40 mg once\
  \ daily (n = 11) or captopril 6.25 and 12.5 mg twice daily (n = 13) in a double-blind\
  \ randomized trial. Before treatment, 13 of 24 patients had PPH, and 2 of 24 patients\
  \ had OH. The first dose of furosemide significantly decreased postprandial systolic\
  \ BP (p <0.05) and postprandial frontal cortical oxygenation (p <0.05), whereas\
  \ the first dose of captopril did not. Furosemide and captopril did not significantly\
  \ affect postprandial or orthostatic BP or cortical oxygenation after 2 weeks of\
  \ treatment. Thus, PPH is a common phenomenon in elderly patients with heart failure,\
  \ whereas OH is not. The first dose of furosemide 40 mg decreased postprandial systolic\
  \ BP and frontal cortical oxygenation, in contrast with the first dose of captopril\
  \ 6.25 mg and 2-week treatment with furosemide 40 mg once daily or captopril 12.5\
  \ mg twice daily. These findings indicate that initiating furosemide treatment worsens\
  \ PPH, and furosemide is less safe in elderly patients with heart failure. \xA9\
