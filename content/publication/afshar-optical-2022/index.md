abstract: 'The main objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of NIRS
  (PortaMon®, Artinis Medical Systems) as a noninvasive monitoring method for kidney
  transplant function. We hypothesized that changes in NIRS (near infra-red spectroscopy)
  parameters are associated with changes in graft function as estimated by Glomerular
  Filtration Rate (GFR) based on serum creatinine level. Two cohorts of participants
  were recruited: Immediate postoperative and those with at least 8 weeks post-transplant.
  Other inclusion criteria were BMItextless25kg/m2 and AWD (abdominal wall depth)
  textless2cm. We evaluated 4 patients immediately after the surgery in the operating
  room and continued the examination every day while they were in the hospital. We
  also monitored them for 12 weeks after surgery. The second group (16 patients) had
  their surgery in a median of 26 months prior to their recruitment. The procedure
  of NIRS monitoring was the same for both groups. We examined the surgical sites
  and opposite sides of the abdomen as our control for at least 3 minutes each time.
  The collected data were compared with clinical parameters (BP, e-GFR, and Resistive
  Index). We analyzed the collected data using linear regression model and we noted
  a positive significant correlation between the tissue saturation index of the surgical
  site (TOISS%) and e-GFR adjusted for BMI. We also examined the ∆TOI% (percentage
  of difference of oxygen saturation index between the surgical site and opposite
  site) to account for the abdominal muscle effects on collected signals.'
