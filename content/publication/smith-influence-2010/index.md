abstract: "The study examined the influence of cerebral (prefrontal cortex) and muscle\
  \ (vastus lateralis) oxygenation on the ability to perform repeated, cycling sprints.\
  \ Thirteen team-sport athletes performed ten, 10-s sprints (with 30 s of rest) under\
  \ normoxic (FIO2 0.21) and acute hypoxic (F IO2 0.13) conditions in a randomised,\
  \ single-blind fashion and crossover design. Mechanical work was calculated and\
  \ arterial O2 saturation (SpO2) was estimated via pulse oximetry for every sprint.\
  \ Cerebral and muscle oxy-(O2Hb), deoxy-(HHb), and total haemoglobin (THb) were\
  \ monitored continuously by near-infrared spectroscopy. Compared with normoxia,\
  \ hypoxia induced larger decrements in SpO 2 and work (11.6 and 7.6%, respectively;\
  \ P < 0.05). In the muscle, we observed a fairly constant level of deoxygenation\
  \ across sprints, with no effect of the condition. In normoxia, regional cerebral\
  \ oxygenation increased during the first two sprints and slightly fluctuated thereafter.\
  \ In contrast, this initial cerebral hyper-oxygenation was attenuated in hypoxia.\
  \ Changes in [O2Hb] and [HHb] occurred earlier and were larger in hypoxia compared\
  \ with normoxia (P < 0.05), while regional blood volume ($\u0394$[THb]) remained\
  \ unaffected by the condition. Changes in cerebral [HHb] and mechanical work were\
  \ strongly correlated in normoxia and hypoxia (R 2 = 0.81 and R 2 = 0.85, respectively;\
  \ P < 0.05), although the slope of this relationship differed (normoxia, -351.3\
  \ \xB1 183.3 vs. hypoxia, -442.4 \xB1 227.2; P < 0.05). The results of this NIRS\
  \ study show that O 2 availability influences prefrontal cortex, but not muscle,\
  \ oxygenation during repeated, short sprints. By using a hypoxia paradigm, the study\
  \ suggests that cerebral oxygenation contributes to the impairment of repeated-sprint\
  \ ability. \xA9 Springer-Verlag 2010."
