abstract: 'Background: Reports suggest that adults with post-COVID-19 syndrome or
  long COVID may be affected by orthostatic intolerance syndromes, with autonomic
  nervous system dysfunction as a possible causal factor of neurocardiovascular instability
  (NCVI). Long COVID can also manifest as prolonged fatigue, which may be linked to
  neuromuscular function impairment (NMFI). The current clinical assessment for NCVI
  monitors neurocardiovascular performance upon the application of orthostatic stressors
  such as an active (i.e., self-induced) stand or a passive (tilt table) standing
  test. Lower limb muscle contractions may be important in orthostatic recovery via
  the skeletal muscle pump. In this study, adults with long COVID were assessed with
  a protocol that, in addition to the standard NCVI tests, incorporated simultaneous
  lower limb muscle monitoring for NMFI assessment. Methods: To conduct such an investigation,
  a wide range of continuous non-invasive biomedical sensing technologies were employed,
  including digital artery photoplethysmography for the extraction of cardiovascular
  signals, near-infrared spectroscopy for the extraction of regional tissue oxygenation
  in brain and muscle, and electromyography for assessment of timed muscle contractions
  in the lower limbs. Results: With the proposed methodology described and exemplified
  in this paper, we were able to collect relevant physiological data for the assessment
  of neurocardiovascular and neuromuscular functioning. We were also able to integrate
  signals from a variety of instruments in a synchronized fashion and visualize the
  interactions between different physiological signals during the combined NCVI/NMFI
  assessment. Multiple counts of evidence were collected, which can capture the dynamics
  between skeletal muscle contractions and neurocardiovascular responses. Conclusions:
  The proposed methodology can offer an overview of the functioning of the neurocardiovascular
  and neuromuscular systems in a combined NCVI/NMFI setup and is capable of conducting
  comparative studies with signals from multiple participants at any given time in
  the assessment. This could help clinicians and researchers generate and test hypotheses
  based on the multimodal inspection of raw data in long COVID and other cohorts.'
