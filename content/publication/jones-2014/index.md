abstract: "\xA9 The Authors.The purpose of this research was to waterproof a near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy device (PortaMon, Artinis Medical Systems) to enable NIR measurement\
  \ during swim exercise. Candidate materials were initially tested for waterproof\
  \ suitability by comparing light intensity values during phantom-based tissue assessment.\
  \ Secondary assessment involved repeated isokinetic exercises ensuring reliability\
  \ of the results obtained from the modified device. Tertiary assessment required\
  \ analysis of the effect of water immersion and temperature upon device function.\
  \ Initial testing revealed that merely covering the PortaMon light sources with\
  \ waterproof materials considerably affected the NIR light intensities. Modifying\
  \ a commercially available silicone covering through the addition of a polyvinyl\
  \ chloride material (impermeable to NIR light transmission) produces an acceptable\
  \ compromise. Bland-Altman analysis indicated that exercise-induced changes in tissue\
  \ saturation index (TSI %) were within acceptable limits during laboratory exercise.\
  \ Although water immersion had a small but significant effect upon NIR light intensity,\
  \ this resulted in a negligible change in the measured TSI (%). We then tested the\
  \ waterproof device in vivo illustrating oxygenation changes during a 100 m freestyle\
  \ swim case study. Finally, a full study compared club level swimmers and triathletes.\
  \ Significant changes in oxygenation profiles when comparing upper and lower extremities\
  \ for the two groups were revealed, reflecting differences in swim biomechanics."
