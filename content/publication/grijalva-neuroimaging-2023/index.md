abstract: Impacts in mixed martial arts (MMA) have been studied mainly in regard to
  the long-term effects of concussions. However, repetitive sub-concussive head impacts
  at the hyperacute phase (minutes after impact), are not understood. The head experiences
  rapid acceleration similar to a concussion, but without clinical symptoms. We utilize
  portable neuroimaging technology – transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound and functional
  near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) – to estimate the extent of pre- and post-differences
  following contact and non-contact sparring sessions in nine MMA athletes. In addition,
  the extent of changes in neurofilament light (NfL) protein biomarker concentrations,
  and neurocognitive/balance parameters were determined following impacts. Athletes
  were instrumented with sensor-based mouth guards to record head kinematics. TCD
  and fNIRS results demonstrated significantly increased blood flow velocity (p =
  0.01) as well as prefrontal (p = 0.01) and motor cortex (p = 0.04) oxygenation,
  only following the contact sparring sessions. This increase after contact was correlated
  with the cumulative angular acceleration experienced during impacts (p = 0.01).
  In addition, the NfL biomarker demonstrated positive correlations with angular acceleration
  (p = 0.03), and maximum principal and fiber strain (p = 0.01). On average athletes
  experienced 23.9 ± 2.9 g peak linear acceleration, 10.29 ± 1.1 rad/s peak angular
  velocity, and 1,502.3 ± 532.3 rad/s2 angular acceleration. Balance parameters were
  significantly increased following contact sparring for medial-lateral (ML) center
  of mass (COM) sway, and ML ankle angle (p = 0.01), illustrating worsened balance.
  These combined results reveal significant changes in brain hemodynamics and neurophysiological
  parameters that occur immediately after sub-concussive impacts and suggest that
  the physical impact to the head plays an important role in these changes.
