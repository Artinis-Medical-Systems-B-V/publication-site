abstract: "Purpose: Speed skating leads to blood-flow restriction and deoxygenation\
  \ in the lower limbs (especially the right leg) that may affect performance. Although\
  \ the acute influence of such deoxygenation is not clearly understood, the authors\
  \ tested whether remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) could modify muscular oxygenation\
  \ and improve time-trial performance in that sport. Methods: Using a randomized,\
  \ single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, 9 elite speed skaters performed\
  \ 1000-m on-ice time trials preceded by either RIPC of the upper limbs (3 \xD7 5-min\
  \ compression/5-min reperfusion cycles at 30 mm Hg >arterial systolic pressure)\
  \ or placebo treatment (SHAM; 10 mm Hg). Changes in tissue saturation index, oxyhemoglobin\u2013\
  oxymyoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin\u2013deoxymyoglobin, and total hemoglobin\u2013myoglobin\
  \ in the right vastus lateralis muscle were monitored using near-infrared spectroscopy\
  \ (NIRS). Differences between RIPC and SHAM were analyzed using Cohen effect size\
  \ (ES) \xB1 90% confidence limits and magnitude-based inferences. Results: Compared\
  \ with SHAM, RIPC had a negligible effect on performance and NIRS variables. However,\
  \ in a subgroup of sprinters (n = 5), RIPC likely lowered tissue saturation index\
  \ at the beginning of the time trial (\u22126.1%; ES = \u22120.65) and likely increased\
  \ deoxyhemoglobin\u2013deoxymyoglobin at the beginning (3%; ES = 0.39), middle (2.9%;\
  \ ES = 0.37), and end of the trial (\u22122.1%; ES = 0.27). In the middle section\
  \ of the trial, these metabolic changes were concomitant with a possible increase\
  \ in total hemoglobin\u2013myoglobin. Conclusion: RIPC has no practical ergogenic\
  \ impact on 1000-m long-track speed-skating performance in elite athletes. The relevance\
  \ of using RIPC during training to increase physiological stress in sprinters particularly\
  \ deserves further investigation."
