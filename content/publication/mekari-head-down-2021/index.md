abstract: Abstract  Purpose  Microgravity has been shown to be a significant stressor
  on the cardiovascular system and the brain due to the redistribution of fluids that
  occurs in the absence of gravitational force, but there is scarce literature surrounding
  the effects of microgravity on cerebral hemodynamics and cognition. Understanding
  the early effects that simulated gravity has on cognitive function is essential
  for developing proper physical and cognitive countermeasures to assure safe and
  effective cognitive/decisions making while astronauts prepare for the initial launch
  or when they arrive in a microgravity environment. Therefore, this study aims to
  determine how an acute simulation of microgravity would alter cerebral oxygenation
  and executive functions. Methods  Sixty-five young healthy participants (22±6 years,
  21 females) completed a thirty (30) minute horizontal (0 0 tilt) followed by a 90-min
  -6° head-down-tilt (HDT) protocol. Cerebral oxygenation in the prefrontal cortex
  was monitored throughout the testing session using near-infrared spectroscopy. Cognition
  was also measured using a computerized Stroop Task. Results  Our results demonstrate
  that cerebral oxygenation was higher during HDT compared to the horizontal supine
  position (9.11±1.3 vs 7.51±1.8, p=0.02). For the cognitive results, the non-executive
  performance of the Stroop task remained stable during HDT (652.46± 19.3 vs. 632.49±14.5,
  p=0.09). However, reaction time during the executive task performance was improved
  after the HDT (1058±195 msec to 950±158 msec, ptextless0.01). Conclusion  Our results
  suggest that an acute bout of simulated microgravity can enhance executive functioning.
