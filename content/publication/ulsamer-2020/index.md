abstract: "Virtual Reality (VR) not only offers great opportunities in terms of entertainment,\
  \ it is also widely applicable in the field of attention guidance, medicine and\
  \ psychology. The distinction between VR and ordinary media is the 360$$^\u2218\
  \ $$ - also known as omnidirectional - environment. When applying the option of\
  \ an omnidirectional platform with auditory as well as visual actions, the focus\
  \ on the right story line within VR is crucial. In order to analyze whether attention\
  \ guidance in VR activates the same brain regions as in the real world, data of\
  \ both topographical brain views must be compared. To do so, functional near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy (fNIRS), a brain imaging technology, is being utilized. fNIRS is\
  \ a non-invasive neuroimaging technique, which measures brain oxygenation and by\
  \ that identifies brain activity. The fNIRS method offers a fast and convenient\
  \ application and is easily adaptable to the field of VR. In this experiment, the\
  \ brain activity of 23 participants was examined under two scenarios. The first\
  \ scenario required the location of click noises when being present in the real\
  \ world, while the second scenario demanded the same in the virtual reality. The\
  \ environment of both settings - in the real world as well as in the virtual world\
  \ - were identical. Each brain picture was analyzed on the basis of a within-subject\
  \ design. Therefore, all participants were required to experience both settings\
  \ while wearing fNIRS in order to compare similarities and differences of the recordings.\
  \ Once all 46 recordings were allocated and broken down by milliseconds, a cortex\
  \ view through Oxysoft - a software that analyzes and evaluates NIRS recordings\
  \ - was generated. Despite fNIRS limited recording depth, increased brain activity\
  \ was detected during the subject's click orientation. The greatest disparity between\
  \ the resting phase and the stimulation was visible in the temporal as well as the\
  \ parietal lobe. Findings also showed that in spite of the stimulated brain regions,\
  \ the hemoglobin level remained the same in both environments, the real world and\
  \ the virtual world."
