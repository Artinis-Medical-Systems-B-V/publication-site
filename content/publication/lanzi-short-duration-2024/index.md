abstract: 'Introduction: Supervised exercise training is among the first-line therapies
  for patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). Current recommendations for exercise
  include guidance focusing on claudication pain, programme and session duration,
  and frequency. However, no guidance is offered regarding exercise training intensity.
  This study aims to compare the effects of 12-week-long supervised walking exercise
  training (high-intensity interval training (HIIT) vs moderate-intensity exercise
  (MOD)) in patients with chronic symptomatic PAD. Methods and analysis: This study
  is a monocentric, interventional, non-blinded randomised controlled trial. 60 patients
  (30 in each group) will be randomly allocated (by using the random permuted blocks)
  to 12 weeks (three times a week) of HIIT or MOD. For HIIT, exercise sessions will
  consist of alternating brief high-intensity (≥85% of the peak heart rate (HRpeak))
  periods (≤60 s) of work with periods of passive rest. Patients will be asked to
  complete 1 and then 2 sets of 5–7 (progressing to 10–15×60 s) walking intervals.
  For the MOD group, exercise training sessions will consist of an alternation of
  periods of work performed at moderate intensity (≤76% HRpeak) and periods of passive
  rest. Interventions will be matched by training load. The primary outcome will be
  the maximal walking distance. Secondary outcomes will include functional performance,
  functional capacity, heath-related quality of life, self-perceived walking abilities,
  physical activity and haemodynamic parameters.'
