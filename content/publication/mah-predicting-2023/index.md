abstract: The anaerobic threshold (AT) is a point during intense exercise that can
  be used to predict muscular fatigue. Determining the AT non-invasively helps to
  adjust exercise intensity and prevent overuse injuries. Near-infrared spectroscopy
  (NIRS) is an optical technology that can provide real-time information about muscle
  oxidative metabolism. The objective of this pilot study was to investigate the relationship
  between NIRS parameters of muscle oxygenation and traditional measures of exercise
  monitoring, such as heart rate and relative body oxygen consumption (VO2). Healthy
  adults with moderate to high fitness levels participated in an incremental exercise
  protocol on a stationary bicycle. NIRS parameters were compared to ventilatory VO2
  using a metabolic cart. Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) textless 1.0 was used as
  a proxy for determining the AT. NIRS data were collected from the primary locomotor
  muscle (vastus lateralis - VL) and a control muscle (deltoid) using two wearable
  NIRS sensors. Heart rate data were collected by a wearable ECG sensor. The NIRS
  data showed a significant decline in VL muscle oxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb) concentration
  (ptextless0.05) at one exercise stage after the AT was identified. Muscle O2Hb did
  not show a significant decrease in the deltoid at the AT. Furthermore, there were
  no noticeable changes in heart rate at the AT. Our results indicate that a wearable
  NIRS sensor can predict the AT in exercising muscles and may provide a localized
  measure of muscular fatigue during exercise.
