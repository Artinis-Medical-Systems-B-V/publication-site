abstract: "Bladder studies are the most recent biomedical application of NIRS in urology.\
  \ Transcutaneous monitoring of the detrusor muscle in the bladder wall as the organ\
  \ fills and empties offers new parameters for evaluation of normal and dysfunctional\
  \ voiding. While established as a research entity clinical adoption requires comprehensive\
  \ understanding of the attributes and limitations of the technique. We review key\
  \ anatomic and physiologic elements that suit the bladder to study using NIRS. These\
  \ include the depth and consistent relationship of the anterior wall below the abdominal\
  \ skin which allow transcutaneous monitoring; the unique vascular anatomy which\
  \ is central to normal organ function and maintenance of perfusion during the spatial\
  \ changes that occur during bladder expansion and contraction; and the known association\
  \ of various pathologies with adverse effects on the microcirculation and compromise\
  \ of the contractile properties of the detrusor muscle. Such pathologies cause symptoms\
  \ of voiding dysfunction which in many patients are due to disordered detrusor hemodynamics\
  \ and/or an imbalance in oxygen supply and demand. Yet current clinical methodology\
  \ for evaluating the underlying cause of voiding dysfunction only measures pressure\
  \ and flow, and provides no information related to bladder hemodynamics or oxygenation.\
  \ Monitoring data from prior studies that illustrate how NIRS of the bladder can\
  \ contribute novel information related to the physiology of the bladder in health\
  \ and disease are summarized. \xA9 2012 - IOS Press and the authors."
