abstract: The present study investigated age-related changes in the time-varying hemodynamics
  of the prefrontal cortex by using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). NIRS is a real-time
  spectroscopic method used to measure functional hemodynamic responses related to
  neural activation in the brain. The prefrontal hemodynamic responses of 17 young
  adults and 21 elderly adults were monitored while they completed the Wisconsin card
  sorting test (WCST). The results revealed a slower activation pattern in oxyhemoglobin
  concentrations in the elderly group than in the young group. Furthermore, quantified
  results revealed time- varying trends in hemodynamic responses. The findings imply
  that age-related decline in hemodynamic responses may contribute to poorer performance
  during cognitive tasks.
