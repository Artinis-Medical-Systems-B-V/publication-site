abstract: 'Screening guidelines for cognitive impairment are subjective and inconsistent,
  often leading to delayed diagnoses. An objective, simple method is needed. Dual-tasking,
  combined with brain function measurements, may provide sufficient cognitive cost
  to differentiate between healthy and cognitively impaired populations. It was hypothesized
  that low complexity (entropy) of brain activity is associated with cognitive impairment,
  and that dual-tasking would better differentiate between healthy and cognitively
  impaired groups over resting. Eighty-three participants were recruited: healthy
  young adults (HY; MoCA = 27.82 ± 1.63, age = 21.13 ± 2.36), cognitively normal older
  adults (CN; MoCA = 26.59 ± 1.92, age = 75.89 ± 6.93), and mild cognitively impaired/early-stage
  Alzheimer''s disease older adults (MCI/AD; MoCA =18.96 ± 5.69, age = 78.62 ± 8.54).
  Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) measured brain activity during a rest
  and dual-task involving flexion and serial subtraction. The area under the curve
  (AUC) of multiple scale entropy outcomes was averaged by functional brain regions:
  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC), front
  eye fields, motor, visuomotor, and primary sensory. During dual-tasking, the average
  AUC values across all fNIRS channels were 75.02 ± 12.51, 61.44 ± 14.60 and 42.26
  ± 22.89 for HY, CN, and MCI/AD groups, respectively. During dual-tasking, differences
  between AUC values of CN and MCI/AD groups were significant for the average across
  all channels, primary sensory, aPFC, and dlPFC regions (p textless 0.05). During
  rest, only the average across all channels was significantly different between CN
  and MCI/AD groups (p = 0.02). Findings suggest that dual-tasking may better screen
  for cognitive impairment using fNIRS compared to other task types, especially in
  regions associated with pathological and behavioral changes in AD.'
