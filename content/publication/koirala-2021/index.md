abstract: "Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) signals quantify the oxygenated ($\u0394\
  $HbMbO 2 ) and deoxygenated ($\u0394$HHbMb) heme group concentrations. $\u0394$HHbMb\
  \ has been preferred to $\u0394$HbMbO 2 in evaluating skeletal muscle oxygen extraction\
  \ because it is assumed to be insensitive to blood volume (BV) changes, but uncertainties\
  \ exist on this assumption. To analyze this assumption a computational model of\
  \ oxygen transport and metabolism is used to quantify the effect of O 2 delivery\
  \ and BV changes on the NIRS signals from a canine model of muscle oxidative metabolism\
  \ (Med.Sci.SportsExerc.,48(10)2013-2020,2016). The computational analysis accounts\
  \ for microvascular ($\u0394$HbO 2 , $\u0394$HHb) and extravascular ($\u0394$HMb,\
  \ $\u0394$HMb) oxygenated and deoxygenated forms. Simulations predicted muscle oxygen\
  \ uptake and NIRS signal changes well for blood flows ranging from resting to contracting\
  \ muscle. Additional NIRS signal simulations were obtained in the absence or presence\
  \ of BV changes corresponding to a heme groups concentration changes ($\u0394$HbMb=0-48$\u03BC\
  $M). Under normal delivery (Q=1.0L kg -1 min -1 ) of contracting muscle, capillary\
  \ oxygen saturation (SO 2 ) was 62% with capillary $\u0394$HbO 2 and $\u0394$HHb\
  \ of \xB141$\u03BC$M for $\u0394$HbMb=0. An increase of BV ($\u0394$HbMb =24mM)\
  \ caused a $\u0394$HbO 2 decrease (16mM) almost twice as much as the increase observed\
  \ for $\u0394$HHb (9$\u03BC$M). When SO 2 increased to more than 80%, only $\u0394\
  $HbO 2 was significantly affected by BV changes. The analysis indicates that microvascular\
  \ SO 2 is a key factor in determining the sensitivity of $\u0394$HbMbO 2 and $\u0394\
  $HHbMb to BV changes. Contrary to a common assumption, the $\u0394$HHbMb is affected\
  \ by BV changes in normal contracting muscle and even more in the presence of impaired\
  \ O 2 delivery."
