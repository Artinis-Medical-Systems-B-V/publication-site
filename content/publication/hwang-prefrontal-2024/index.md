abstract: 'Introduction: Walking in complex environments increases the cognitive demand
  of locomotor control; however, our understanding of the neural mechanisms contributing
  to walking on uneven terrain is limited. We used a novel method for altering terrain
  unevenness on a treadmill to investigate the association between terrain unevenness
  and cortical activity in the prefrontal cortex, a region known to be involved in
  various cognitive functions. Methods: Prefrontal cortical activity was measured
  with functional near infrared spectroscopy while participants walked on a novel
  custom-made terrain treadmill surface across four different terrains: flat, low,
  medium, and high levels of unevenness. The assessments were conducted in younger
  adults, older adults with better mobility function and older adults with worse mobility
  function. Mobility function was assessed using the Short Physical Performance Battery.
  The primary hypothesis was that increasing the unevenness of the terrain would result
  in greater prefrontal cortical activation in all groups. Secondary hypotheses were
  that heightened prefrontal cortical activation would be observed in the older groups
  relative to the younger group, and that prefrontal cortical activation would plateau
  at higher levels of terrain unevenness for the older adults with worse mobility
  function, as predicted by the Compensation Related Utilization of Neural Circuits
  Hypothesis. Results: The results revealed a significant main effect of terrain,
  indicating a significant increase in prefrontal cortical activation with increasing
  terrain unevenness during walking in all groups. A significant main effect of group
  revealed that prefrontal cortical activation was higher in older adults with better
  mobility function compared to younger adults and older adults with worse mobility
  function in all pooled terrains, but there was no significant difference in prefrontal
  cortical activation between older adults with worse mobility function and younger
  adults. Contrary to our hypothesis, the older group with better mobility function
  displayed a sustained increase in activation but the other groups did not, suggestive
  of neural compensation. Additional findings were that task-related increases in
  prefrontal cortical activation during walking were lateralized to the right hemisphere
  in older adults with better mobility function but were bilateral in older adults
  with worse mobility function and younger adults. Discussion: These findings support
  that compared to walking on a flat surface, walking on uneven terrain surfaces increases
  demand on cognitive control resources as measured by prefrontal cortical activation.'
