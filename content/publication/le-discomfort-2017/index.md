abstract: Scenes from nature share in common certain statistical properties. Images
  with these properties can be processed efficiently by the human brain. Patterns
  with unnatural statistical properties are uncomfortable to look at, and are processed
  inefficiently, according to computational models of the visual cortex. Consistent
  with such putative computational inefficiency, uncomfortable images have been demonstrated
  to elicit a large haemodynamic response in the visual cortex, particularly so in
  individuals who are predisposed to discomfort. In a succession of five small-scale
  studies, we show that these considerations may be important in the design of the
  modern urban environment. In two studies we show that images from the urban environment
  are uncomfortable to the extent that their statistical properties depart from those
  of scenes from nature. In a third study we measure the haemodynamic response to
  images of buildings computed as having unnatural or natural statistical properties,
  and show that in posterior brain regions the images with unnatural statistical properties
  (often judged uncomfortable) elicit a haemodynamic response that is larger than
  for images with more natural properties. In two further studies we show that judgments
  of discomfort from real scenes (both shrubbery and buildings) are similar to those
  from images of the scenes. We conclude that the unnatural scenes in the modern urban
  environment are sometimes uncomfortable and place excessive demands on the neural
  computation involved in vision, with consequences for brain metabolism, and possibly
  also for health.
