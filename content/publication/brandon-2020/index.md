abstract: Military performance depends on high-level cognition, specifically executive
  function (EF), while simultaneously performing strenuous exercise. However, most
  studies examine cognitive performance following, not during, exercise. Therefore,
  our aim was to examine the relationship between EF and exercise intensity. Following
  familiarization, 13 Reserve Officers' Training Corp cadets (age = 19.6 + 2 yr, five
  women) completed a graded exercise test (GxT) and two executive function exercise
  tests (EFETs) separated by a duration of >24 h. The EFET was a combined iPad-based
  EF test (Cedar Operator Workload Assessment Tool) and GxT. Heart rate (HR) and prefrontal
  cortex (PFC) oxygenation [near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)] were continuously recorded.
  The EF score was analyzed for accuracy of responses (%hit rate). Heart rate reserve
  was calculated to normalize exercise intensity (%HRR). For PFC oxygenation recordings,
  NIRS variables were used to calculate the tissue saturation index (%TSI). Data from
  EFET trials were averaged into a singular response. The %hit rate declined at heart
  rate reserves (HRRs) of >80%, reaching nadir at 100% HRR (74.09 + 10.63%, P < 0.01).
  The tissue saturation index (TSI) followed a similar pattern, declining at >70%
  of HRR and at a greater rate during EFET compared with during GxT (P < 0.01), reaching
  a nadir in both conditions at 100% HRR (60.39 +2.94 vs. 63.13 + 3.16%, P < 0.01).
  Therefore, EF decline is dependent on exercise intensity, as is %TSI. These data
  suggest that reductions in EF during high-intensity exercise are at least in part
  related to attenuated PFC oxygenation. Thus, interventions that improve PFC oxygenation
  may improve combined exercise and EF performance.
