abstract: "Lower-extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with increased\
  \ risk of cardiovascular events and impaired exercise tolerance. We have previously\
  \ reported that leg heat therapy (HT) applied using liquid-circulating trousers\
  \ perfused with warm water increases leg blood flow and reduces blood pressure (BP)\
  \ and the circulating levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1) in patients with symptomatic\
  \ PAD. In this sham-controlled, randomized, crossover study, sixteen patients with\
  \ symptomatic PAD (age 65\_\xB1\_5.7\_years and ankle-brachial index: 0.69\_\xB1\
  \_0.1) underwent a single 90-min session of HT or a sham treatment prior to a symptom-limited,\
  \ graded cardiopulmonary exercise test on the treadmill. The primary outcome was\
  \ the peak walking time (PWT) during the exercise test. Secondary outcomes included\
  \ the claudication onset time (COT), resting and exercise BP, calf muscle oxygenation,\
  \ pulmonary oxygen uptake (V\u0307O2), and plasma levels of ET-1, interleukin-6\
  \ (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-$\u03B1$). Systolic, but not diastolic\
  \ BP, was significantly lower ($\u223C$7\_mmHg, p\_<.05) during HT when compared\
  \ to the sham treatment. There was also a trend for lower SBP throughout the exercise\
  \ and the recovery period following HT (p\_=.057). While COT did not differ between\
  \ treatments (p\_=.77), PWT tended to increase following HT (CON: 911\_\xB1\_69\_\
  s, HT: 954\_\xB1\_77\_s, p\_=.059). Post-exercise plasma levels of ET-1 were also\
  \ lower in the HT session (CON: 2.0\_\xB1\_0.1, HT: 1.7\_\xB1\_0.1, p\_=.02). Calf\
  \ muscle oxygenation, V\u0307O2, COT, IL-6, and TNF-$\u03B1$ did not differ between\
  \ treatments. A single session of leg HT lowers BP and post-exercise circulating\
  \ levels of ET-1 and may enhance treadmill walking performance in symptomatic PAD\
  \ patients."
