abstract: Consumers undergo an intellectual burden when working with technological
  programs. Mostly in situations  of several activities. For instance, while communicating
  when driving with the navigation device. It is not necessary to  divert users from
  their primary duties in such circumstances. In memory cycles and related workload,
  the pre-frontal  cortex (PFC) has a significant role to play. In this study, we
  have used data from 10 participants to evaluate the task  behaviors in PFC with
  usable near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), which is a non-invasive imaging modality.
  In  classification, CNN research has been state of the art. This has undermined
  the need to extract features manually. In  order to assess the mental workload,
  we implemented a time-frequency approach with CNN approach. Rather than  traditional
  CNN network we used ResNet50 pretrained network here. Application of Wigner-Ville
  Distribution in  Functional Imaging is introduced here. The proposed CNN approach
  achieves a considerable average improvement  relative to conventional methods. The
  results across differences in time window length are benchmarked. Satisfactory  result
  obtained with twenty five second window for which the CNN yields 98% correct classification
  where traditional  CNN achieved 89% accuracy.
