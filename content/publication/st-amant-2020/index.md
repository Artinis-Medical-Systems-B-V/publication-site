abstract: "Objectives: The postural control dual-task literature has demonstrated\
  \ greater postural stability during dual-task in comparison to single task (i.e.,\
  \ standing balance alone through the examination of multiple kinetic and kinematic\
  \ measures. This improve stability is thought to reflect an automatic mode of postural\
  \ control during dual-task. Recently, sample entropy (SampEn) and wavelet discrete\
  \ transform have supported the claim of automaticity, as higher SampEn values and\
  \ a shift toward increased contributions from automatic sensory systems have been\
  \ demonstrated in dual-task settings. In order to understand the cortical component\
  \ of postural control, functional near-infrared spectroscopy has been used to measure\
  \ cortical activation during postural control conditions. However, the neural correlates\
  \ of automatic postural behaviour have yet to be fully investigated. Therefore,\
  \ the purpose of this study is to confirm the presence of automatic postural control\
  \ through static and dynamic balance measures, and to investigate the prefrontal\
  \ cortex activation when concurrently performing quiet standing and the auditory\
  \ cognitive tasks of varied difficulty. Method: Eighteen healthy young adults (21.4\
  \ \xB1 3.96 yo), 12 females and 6 males, with no balance deficits were recruited.\
  \ Participants were instructed to either quietly stand on a force platform (SM),\
  \ perform three cognitive tasks while seated (SC) or perform both aforementioned\
  \ tasks concurrently (DT). Results: Results supported automatic postural control\
  \ with lower area and standard deviation of center-of-pressure in DT conditions\
  \ compared to SM. As for SampEn and the wavelet analysis, DT conditions demonstrated\
  \ greater values than SM, and a shift from vision to a cerebellar contribution.\
  \ For the most difficult cognitive task, the DNS task, a trend toward significantly\
  \ lower right hemisphere prefrontal cortex activation compared to left hemisphere\
  \ activation in DT was found, potentially representing a decrease in cognitive control,\
  \ and the presence of automaticity. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the\
  \ simultaneous performance of a difficult cognitive task and posture yields automatic\
  \ postural behaviour, and provides insight into the neural correlates of automaticity."
