abstract: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a metabolic disease associated with cardiovascular
  dysfunction. The myocardium preferentially uses ketones over free fatty acids as
  a more energy efficient substrate. The primary aim was to assess the effects of
  ketone monoester (Kme) ingestion on cardiac output index (Q̇i). Secondary aims were
  to assess the effects of Kme ingestion on markers of cardiac haemodynamics, muscle
  oxygenation and vascular function at rest, during and following step-incremental
  cycling. We undertook a double-blind, randomised, crossover design study in 13 adults
  (age, 66±10 y; BMI, 31.3±7.0 kg·m−2) with T2D. Participants completed two conditions,
  where they ingested a Kme (0.115 g‧kg−1) or a placebo taste-mathced drink. Cardiac
  function was measured using thoracic impedance cardiography and muscle oxygenation
  of the calf was determined via near-infrared spectroscopy. Macrovascular endothelial
  function was measured by flow mediated dilation (FMD) and microvascular endothelial
  function was measured via transdermal delivery of acetylcholine (ACh) and insulin.
  Circulating β-hydroxybutyrate [β-Hb] was measured throughout. Kme ingestion raised
  circulating β-Hb throughout the protocol (peak 1.9 mM; P=0.001 vs. placebo). Kme
  ingestion increased Q̇i by 0.75±0.5 L∙min−1∙m−2 (P=0.003) stroke volume index by
  7.2±4.5 mL∙m−2 (P=0.001), and peripheral muscle oxygenation by 9.9±7.1% (P=0.001)
  and reduced systemic vascular resistance index by-420±-225 dyn∙s−1∙cm−5∙m−2 (P=0.031)
  compared to placebo condition. There were no differences between Kme and placebo
  in heart rate (P=0.995), FMD (P=0.542), ACh max (P=0.800), insulin max (P=0.242).
  Ingestion of Kme improved Q̇i, stroke volume index and peripheral muscle oxygenation,
  but did not alter macro- or microvascular endothelial function in people with T2D.
