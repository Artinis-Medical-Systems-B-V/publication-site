abstract: "New Findings: What is the central question of this study? Exercise performance\
  \ is limited during hypoxia by a critical reduction in cerebral and skeletal tissue\
  \ oxygenation. To what extent an elevation in systemic free radical accumulation\
  \ contributes to microvascular deoxygenation and the corresponding reduction in\
  \ maximal aerobic capacity remains unknown. What is the main finding and its importance?\
  \ We show that altered free radical metabolism is not a limiting factor for exercise\
  \ performance in hypoxia, providing important insight into the fundamental mechanisms\
  \ involved in the control of vascular oxygen transport. Exercise performance in\
  \ hypoxia may be limited by a critical reduction in cerebral and skeletal tissue\
  \ oxygenation, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We examined whether\
  \ increased systemic free radical accumulation during hypoxia would be associated\
  \ with elevated microvascular deoxygenation and reduced maximal aerobic capacity\
  \ (V\u02D9O2 max ). Eleven healthy men were randomly assigned single-blind to an\
  \ incremental semi-recumbent cycling test to determine V\u02D9O2 max in both normoxia\
  \ (21% O2) and hypoxia (12% O2) separated by a week. Continuous-wave near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy was employed to monitor concentration changes in oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin\
  \ in the left vastus lateralis muscle and frontal cerebral cortex. Antecubital venous\
  \ blood samples were obtained at rest and at V\u02D9O2 max to determine oxidative\
  \ (ascorbate radical by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy), nitrosative\
  \ (nitric oxide metabolites by ozone-based chemiluminescence and 3-nitrotyrosine\
  \ by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and inflammatory stress biomarkers (soluble\
  \ intercellular/vascular cell adhesion 1 molecules by enzyme-linked immunosorbent\
  \ assay). Hypoxia was associated with increased cerebral and muscle tissue deoxygenation\
  \ and lower V\u02D9O2 max (P < 0.05 versus normoxia). Despite an exercise-induced\
  \ increase in oxidative-nitrosative-inflammatory stress, hypoxia per se did not\
  \ have an additive effect (P > 0.05 versus normoxia). Consequently, we failed to\
  \ observe correlations between any metabolic, haemodynamic and cardiorespiratory\
  \ parameters (P > 0.05). Collectively, these findings suggest that altered free\
  \ radical metabolism cannot explain the elevated microvascular deoxygenation and\
  \ corresponding lower V\u02D9O2 max in hypoxia. Further research is required to\
  \ determine whether free radicals when present in excess do indeed contribute to\
  \ the premature termination of exercise in hypoxia."
