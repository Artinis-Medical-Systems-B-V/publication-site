abstract: "Real-time maps (with temporal and spatial resolution: 1\u201310 Hz and\
  \ $\u223C$1 cm, respectively) of cortical activation can be obtained by functional\
  \ near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), which noninvasively measures cortical hemodynamic\
  \ changes (as oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin changes). The very recent launch\
  \ in the market of commercial wireless/wearable fNIRS systems encourages their application\
  \ in the field of human navigational studies to be carried out in the real-life\
  \ situations."
