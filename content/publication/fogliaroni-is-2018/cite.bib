 abstract = {Real-time maps (with temporal and spatial resolution: 1–10 Hz and $∼$1 cm, respectively) of cortical activation can be obtained by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), which noninvasively measures cortical hemodynamic changes (as oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin changes). The very recent launch in the market of commercial wireless/wearable fNIRS systems encourages their application in the field of human navigational studies to be carried out in the real-life situations.},
