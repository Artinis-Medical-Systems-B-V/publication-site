abstract: "Context: Contrast baths (CB) is a thermal treatment modality used in sports\
  \ medicine, athletic training, and rehabilitation settings. Proposed physiological\
  \ effects of CB include increasing tissue blood flow and oxygenation and decreasing\
  \ tissue swelling and edema to promote better healing, improved limb function, and\
  \ quicker recovery. Objective: To investigate the physiological effects of CB on\
  \ the intramuscular hemodynamics and oxygenation of the lower leg muscles using\
  \ near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), an optical method for monitoring changes in\
  \ tissue oxygenated (O2Hb), deoxygenated (HHb), and total hemoglobin (tHb) as well\
  \ as tissue oxygen saturation index (TSI%). Design: Descriptive laboratory study.\
  \ Patients or Other Participants: Ten healthy men and women with a mean age of 29\
  \ (range \xBC 17 6 42) years, mean body mass index of 24.6 6 3.2, and mean adipose\
  \ tissue thickness of 6.4 6 2.2 mm. Intervention(s): Conventional CB (10-minute\
  \ baseline, 4: 1-minute hot: cold ratio) was applied to the left lower leg. Main\
  \ Outcome Measure(s): Changes in chromophore concentrations of O2Hb, HHb, tHb, and\
  \ TSI% of the gastrocnemius muscle were monitored during 10 minutes of baseline\
  \ measurement, a 30-minute CB protocol, and 10 minutes of recovery using a spatially\
  \ resolved NIRS. Results: After a 30-minute CB protocol, increases (P, .05) in tissue\
  \ O2Hb (7.4 6 4 lM), tHb (7.6 6 6.1 lM), and TSI% (3.1% 6 2.3%) were observed as\
  \ compared with baseline measures. Conclusions: Application of CB induced a transient\
  \ change in the hemodynamics and oxygenation of the gastrocnemius muscle in healthy\
  \ individuals. The effect of CB application in improving tissue hemodynamics and\
  \ oxygenation may, therefore, support the therapeutic benefits of CB in the treatment\
  \ of muscle injuries."
