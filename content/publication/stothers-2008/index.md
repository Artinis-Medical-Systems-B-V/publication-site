abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) uses light to monitor changes
  in the concentration of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin in living tissue non-invasively
  and in real time. Applications of NIRS in urology research and the strengths and
  limitations of this technology are reviewed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A Medline and
  Pub-Med search using "spectroscopy" with heading terms: near infrared (NIR), near
  infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), urology, kidney, renal, urinary tract, bladder, prostate,
  testis and penis. RESULTS: Research incorporating NIRS has investigated a range
  of urologic conditions where a hemodynamic or vascular etiology is thought to be
  the underlying pathophysiology: as an aid to diagnosis in cryptorchidism, testicular
  torsion and vasculogenic erectile dysfunction; to evaluate renal metabolism and
  bladder dysfunction, and to study skeletal muscle metabolism in end stage renal
  disease. Strengths and limitations of NIRS relate primarily to the basic physics
  of how light in the NIR spectrum penetrates tissue and is scattered and absorbed.
  CONCLUSIONS: NIRS is a non-invasive, portable, real time measure of changes in tissue
  perfusion and oxygenation. In urology NIRS appears particularly applicable in ischemic
  conditions, and the evaluation of disorders associated with alterations in regional
  tissue hemodynamics (local changes in pressure, muscle contraction and urinary tract
  obstruction). Because the bladder detrusor can be interrogated transcutaneously
  NIRS may also provide a non-invasive means of evaluating patients with voiding dysfunction.
  Studies to date warrant further research and specific refinement of instrumentation
  and algorithm software for urologic applications, as NIRS could provide urologists
  with new methods of non-invasive physiologic diagnostic evaluation.'
