 abstract = {ypnotizability is associated with several physiological differences, including functional equivalence between actual and imagined action. EEG studies also revealed different information processing in these conditions in participants with high (highs) and low (lows) hypnotizability scores; ideed, it is scarcely localized in highs and specifically network-related in lows. The study aimed to confirm EEG findings using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). NIRS was applied to 10 highs and 9 lows, classified according to Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale:A during actual (M) and imagined (MI) sequential movements of left arm and hand. The ability to be deeply absorbed in tasks and sensory imagination was preliminarily assessed by Tellegen Absorption Scale (TAS) and Betts’ questionnaire, respectively.The results showed task-related [OHb] increases in prefrontal areas only in lows, whereas the premotor area exhibited greater [OHb] during tasks in both groups. Hypnotizability-related differences were not observed in sensorimotor areas. TAS and Betts’ scores sustained some of the observed changes. Correlational analysis between the areas [OHb] showed that hypnotizability plays a greater role in MI than in M. NIRS findings support the earlier EEG findings regarding the different information processing of highs and lows by showing lower brain synaptic activity in highs during actual and imagined movement.},
