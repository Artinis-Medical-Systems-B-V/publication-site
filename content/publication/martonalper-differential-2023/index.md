abstract: 'A fundamental characteristic of the human brain that supports behavior
  is its capacity to create connections between brain regions. A promising approach
  holds that during social behavior, brain regions not only create connections with
  other brain regions within a brain, but also coordinate their activity with other
  brain regions of an interaction partner. Here we ask whether between‐brain and within‐brain
  coupling contribute differentially to movement synchronization. We focused on coupling
  between the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), a brain region associated with the observation‐execution
  system, and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), a region associated with
  error‐monitoring and prediction. Participants, randomly divided into dyads, were
  simultaneously scanned with functional near infra‐red spectroscopy (fNIRS) while
  performing an open‐ended 3D hand movement task consisting of three conditions: back‐to‐back
  movement, free movement, or intentional synchronization. Results show that behavioral
  synchrony was higher in the intentional synchrony compared with the back‐to‐back
  and free movement conditions. Between‐brain coupling in the IFG and dmPFC was evident
  in the free movement and intentional synchrony conditions but not in the back‐to‐back
  condition. Importantly, between‐brain coupling was found to positively predict intentional
  synchrony, while within‐brain coupling was found to predict synchronization during
  free movement. These results indicate that during intentional synchronization, brain
  organization changes such that between‐brain networks, but not within‐brain connections,
  contribute to successful communication, pointing to shift from a within‐brain feedback
  loop to a two‐brains feedback loop.'
