abstract: 'Background: In this observational study, we compared continuous physiological
  signals during an active standing test in adults aged 50 years and over, characterised
  as frail by three different criteria, using data from The Irish Longitudinal Study
  on Ageing (TILDA). Methods: This study utilised data from TILDA, an ongoing landmark
  prospective cohort study of community-dwelling adults aged 50 years or older in
  Ireland. The initial sampling strategy in TILDA was based on random geodirectory
  sampling. Four independent groups were identified: those characterised as frail
  only by one of the frailty tools used (the physical Frailty Phenotype (FP), the
  32-item Frailty Index (FI), or the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) classification tree),
  and a fourth group where participants were not characterised as frail by any of
  these tools. Continuous non-invasive physiological signals were collected during
  an active standing test, including systolic (sBP) and diastolic (dBP) blood pressure,
  as well as heart rate (HR), using digital artery photoplethysmography. Additionally,
  the frontal lobe cerebral oxygenation (Oxy), deoxygenation (Deoxy), and tissue saturation
  index (TSI) were also non-invasively measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).
  The signals were visualised across frailty groups and statistically compared using
  one-dimensional statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Results: A total of 1124 participants
  (mean age of 63.5 years; 50.2% women) were included: 23 were characterised as frail
  only by the FP, 97 by the FI, 38 by the CFS, and 966 by none of these criteria.
  The SPM analyses revealed that only the group characterised as frail by the FI had
  significantly different signals (p textless 0.001) compared to the non-frail group.
  Specifically, they exhibited an attenuated gain in HR between 10 and 15 s post-stand
  and larger deficits in sBP and dBP between 15 and 20 s post-stand. Conclusions:
  The FI proved to be more adept at capturing distinct physiological responses to
  standing, likely due to its direct inclusion of cardiovascular morbidities in its
  definition. Significant differences were observed in the dynamics of cardiovascular
  signals among the frail populations identified by different frailty criteria, suggesting
  that caution should be taken when employing frailty identification tools on physiological
  signals, particularly the neurocardiovascular signals in an active standing test.'
