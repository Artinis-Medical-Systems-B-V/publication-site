 abstract = {In this paper, we have combined electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNRIS) to make a hybrid EEG-NIRS based system for brain-computer interface (BCI). The EEG electrodes were placed on the motor cortex region and the NIRS optodes were set on the prefrontal region. The data of four subjects was acquired using mental arithmetic tasks and motor imageries of the left- and right-hand. The EEG data were band-pass filtered to obtain the activity (8âˆ¼18 Hz). The modified Beer-Lambert law (MBLL) was used to convert the fNIRS data into oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin (HbO and HbR), respectively. A common threshold between the two modalities was established to define a common resting state. The support vector machines (SVM) was used for data classification. Three control commands were generated using the prefrontal and motor cortex data. The results show that EEG and fNIRS can be combined for better brain signal acquisition and classification for BCI.},
