abstract: "In this paper, we have combined electroencephalography (EEG) and functional\
  \ near-infrared spectroscopy (fNRIS) to make a hybrid EEG-NIRS based system for\
  \ brain-computer interface (BCI). The EEG electrodes were placed on the motor cortex\
  \ region and the NIRS optodes were set on the prefrontal region. The data of four\
  \ subjects was acquired using mental arithmetic tasks and motor imageries of the\
  \ left- and right-hand. The EEG data were band-pass filtered to obtain the activity\
  \ (8\u223C18 Hz). The modified Beer-Lambert law (MBLL) was used to convert the fNIRS\
  \ data into oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin (HbO and HbR), respectively. A common threshold\
  \ between the two modalities was established to define a common resting state. The\
  \ support vector machines (SVM) was used for data classification. Three control\
  \ commands were generated using the prefrontal and motor cortex data. The results\
  \ show that EEG and fNIRS can be combined for better brain signal acquisition and\
  \ classification for BCI."
