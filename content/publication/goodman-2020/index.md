abstract: Thirst is represented within the anterior cingulate and insular cortices,
  and may share some common neuroanatomical structures that are implicated with the
  regulation of mental fatigue. This novel study investigated whether thirst might
  modulate the subjective, behavioural, or neurophysiological representations of mental
  fatigue. In a crossover design, thirst was monitored in 15 males during 60 min of
  cycling in normothermic conditions. Participants either consumed water to the dictates
  of their thirst (sated), or fluid was withheld and replaced with periodic salt water
  mouth rinses (thirst). Following either satiety or thirst, a 60 min modified Stroop
  task was completed to evoke mental fatigue. Prefrontal cortex (PFC) haemodynamics
  were monitored throughout the prolonged task, and subjective perceptions of fatigue
  were reported through a visual analogue scale. Behavioural performance was quantified
  as the total number of Stroop task iterations completed in the mentally fatiguing
  task, and by collating response time and accuracy into the inverse efficiency score
  (IES) for each 5 min interval throughout the task. During thirst, fewer iterations
  were completed and poorer IES performance was evident toward the latter portion
  of the mentally fatiguing task. Compensatory elevations in PFC oxyhaemoglobin were
  produced in each condition, however, differed temporally, and were premature during
  thirst. A diminished capacity to sustain cognitive performance is likely the product
  of an inability to preserve the distribution of resources within the prefrontal
  cortex, due to heightened activation about thirst regulatory centres. These data
  provide novel insight into the relationship between thirst and mental fatigue, and
  suggest that drinking to the dictates of thirst may be a pertinent strategy to sustain
  prolonged cognitive performance.
