abstract: Increased production of reactive oxygen species reduces nitric oxide (NO)
  bioavailability and impairs vascular function with aging. Curcumin is a polyphenolic
  compound found in the rhizome of turmeric (Curcuma longa) with antioxidant properties.
  An increasing number of studies have demonstrated improvement in the vasodilatory
  response of conduit arteries following curcumin supplementation, which has been
  associated with increased NO production. However, less is known about the effects
  of curcumin on resistance vessels response. Therefore, the present study aimed to
  investigate the effects of a high single dose of turmeric extract on skeletal muscle
  microvascular reactivity and plasma concentrations of NO metabolites in older adults.
  Twenty-one older adults consumed 10 g of turmeric extract (CUR) or placebo (PLA)
  in a randomized, double-blind, and crossover design. Blood samples were drawn to
  assay NO metabolites (NO2− and NO3−), and changes in oxygen saturation parameters
  following arterial occlusion were used to evaluate microvascular reactivity. There
  were no significant changes in plasma concentrations of NO2− and NO3− as well the
  parameters of oxygen saturation were not affected after CUR. In conclusion, a high
  single dose of turmeric extract does not affect the plasma concentration of NO metabolites
  nor skeletal muscle microvascular reactivity in older adults.
