abstract: 'Purpose: As females have been shown to exhibit greater resistance to fatigue
  in muscles but lower hypoxia-induced cerebral oxygen saturation during whole-body
  exercise, this study was conducted to assess their responses to intense cognitive-motor
  dual-task (CMDT) situations. Recent research has shown that intense CMDT involving
  whole-body exercise increases neuromuscular fatigue and impairs cognitive performance,
  both exacerbated in hypoxic conditions. Methods: Twenty-two healthy young adults
  (11 females) first performed a session in normoxia, including separated cognitive
  (CTLCOG), and cycling tasks (CTLEX). This session was followed by 2 CMDT sessions
  performed in randomized order under normoxia (CMDTNOR) and hypoxia (CMDTHYP). The
  physical exercise consisted of 20-minute cycling at a “hard” perceived effort, and
  the cognitive task consisted of a 15-minute Sustained Attention to Response time
  Task. Psychophysiological measurements included knee-extensor neuromuscular fatigue
  (peripheral/central fatigue components using femoral nerve electrical stimulation)
  and prefrontal cortex oxygenation assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy. Results:
  Sustained Attention to Response time Task performance was similarly decreased for
  males and females (P = .32) in CMDTHYP (−6.3% [1.5%], P textless .001) and CMDTNOR
  (−3.9% [1.5%], P = .048) versus CTLCOG. Neuromuscular fatigue was significant postcycling
  (P textless .001), independent of sex (P = .71) and condition (P = .53). Maximal
  voluntary activation was similarly impaired between sexes (P = .37) in CMDTNOR (−5.8%
  [0.8%], P textless .001) and CMDTHYP (−5.5% [0.8%], P textless .001) versus CTLEX.
  No difference was observed in prefrontal cortex oxygenation during CMDTHYP (P = .23)
  for either males (44.9% [5.3%]) or females (44.3% [2.7%]). Conclusion: These findings
  suggest that intense whole-body CMDTs performed in normoxia and hypoxia negatively
  impact knee-extensor neuromuscular fatigue, sustained attention, and prefrontal
  cortex oxygenation, but the effect does not differ between sexes.'
