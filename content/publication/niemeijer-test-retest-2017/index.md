abstract: "The potential purpose of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) as a clinical\
  \ application in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) is the identification\
  \ of limitations in O2 delivery or utilization during exercise. The objective of\
  \ this study was to evaluate absolute and relative test\u2013retest reliability\
  \ of skeletal muscle oxygenation measurements in patients with CHF. Thirty patients\
  \ with systolic heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction 31\_\xB1\_8%)\
  \ performed 6-min constant-load cycling tests at 80% of the anaerobic threshold\
  \ (AT) with tissue saturation index (TSI) measurement at the vastus lateralis. Tests\
  \ were repeated after 10\_\xB1\_5\_days to evaluate reliability. Absolute reliability\
  \ was assessed with limits of agreement (LoA, expressed as bias\_\xB1\_random error)\
  \ and coefficients of variation (CV) for absolute values (LoA range: 0\u02D94\_\xB1\
  \_6\u02D92% to 0\u02D96\_\xB1\_7\u02D99%; CV range: 4\u02D97\u20137\u02D91%), amplitudes\
  \ (LoA range \u22120\u02D95\_\xB1\_5\u02D98% to \u22120\u02D97\_\xB1\_6\u02D98%;\
  \ CV range: 26\u02D92\u201342\u02D91%), onset and recovery kinetics (mean response\
  \ times; LoA 0\u02D94\_\xB1\_9\u02D95\_s, CV 23\u02D95% and LoA \u22125\u02D98\_\
  \xB1\_50\u02D98\_s, CV 67\u02D94% respectively) and overshoot characteristics (CV\
  \ range 45\u02D97\u2013208\u02D96%). Relative reliability was assessed with intraclass\
  \ correlation coefficients for absolute values (range 0\u02D974\u20130\u02D990),\
  \ amplitudes (range 0\u02D985\u20130\u02D992), onset and recovery kinetics (0\u02D9\
  53 and 0\u02D951, respectively) and overshoot characteristics (range 0\u02D917\u2013\
  0\u02D974). In conclusion, absolute reliability of absolute values and onset kinetics\
  \ seems acceptable for serial within-subject comparison, and as such, for evaluation\
  \ of treatment effects. Absolute reliability of amplitudes and recovery kinetics\
  \ is considered unsatisfactory. Relative reliability of absolute values and amplitudes\
  \ is sufficient for purposes of physiological distinction between patients with\
  \ CHF. Despite lower relative reliability, kinetics may still be useful for clinical\
  \ application."
