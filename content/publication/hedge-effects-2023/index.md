abstract: Human skeletal hemodynamics remain understudied. Neither assessments in
  weight-bearing bones during walking nor following periods of immobility exist, despite
  knowledge of altered nutrient-artery characteristics after short-duration unloading
  in rodents. We studied 12 older adults (8 females, aged 59 ± 3 years) who participated
  in ambulatory near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) assessments of tibial hemodynamics
  before (PRE) and after (POST) 14 days of head-down bed rest (HDBR), with most performing
  daily resistance and aerobic exercise countermeasures during HDBR. Continual simultaneous
  NIRS recordings were acquired over the proximal anteromedial tibial prominence of
  the right lower leg and ipsilateral lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscle during
  supine rest, walking, and standing. During 10 minutes of walking, desaturation kinetics
  in the tibia were slower (time to 95% nadir values 125.4 ± 56.8 s versus 55.0 ± 30.1 s,
  p = 0.0014). Tibial tissue saturation index (TSI) immediately fell (−9.9 ± 4.55)
  and did not completely recover by the end of 10 minutes of walking (−7.4 ± 6.7%,
  p = 0.027). Upon standing, total hemoglobin (tHb) kinetics were faster in the tibia
  (p textless 0.0001), whereas HDBR resulted in faster oxygenated hemoglogin (O2Hb)
  kinetics in both tissues (p = 0.039). After the walk-to-stand transition, changes
  in O2Hb (p = 0.0022) and tHb (p = 0.0047) were attenuated in the tibia alone after
  bed rest. Comparisons of NIRS-derived variables during ambulation and changes in
  posture revealed potentially deleterious adaptations of feed vessels after HDBR.
  We identify important and novel tibial hemodynamics in humans during ambulation
  before and after bed rest, necessitating further investigation.
