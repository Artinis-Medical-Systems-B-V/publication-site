abstract: "New Findings: What is the central question of this study? Does ischaemic\
  \ preconditioning (IPC) influence central and peripheral fatiguing mechanisms during\
  \ sustained maximal isometric exercise? What is the main finding and its importance?\
  \ Voluntary activation and pre- to postexercise reductions in resting twitch torque\
  \ values were unchanged by IPC. However, an effect on tissue oxygenation was observed\
  \ within the IPC trials, where greater concentrations of deoxyhaemoglobin were recorded\
  \ with concurrent upward trends of total haemoglobin concentrations. Using a direct\
  \ assessment of neural drive, we found that IPC had no influence on either central\
  \ or peripheral fatiguing pathways after maximal isometric exercise. Abstract: Ischaemic\
  \ preconditioning (IPC) is thought to inhibit neural feedback from metabolically\
  \ sensitive muscle afferents during exercise. It was hypothesized that IPC could\
  \ affect mechanisms associated with centrally mediated fatigue after a maximally\
  \ fatiguing protocol. Eleven resistance-trained men completed three 2\_min maximal\
  \ voluntary contractions (MVCs) via an isometric leg extension preceded by treatments\
  \ of IPC (three bouts of 5\_min bilateral leg occlusions at 220\_mmHg), SHAM (three\
  \ bouts of 5\_min at 20\_mmHg) or CON (30\_min passive rest). Femoral nerve stimulation\
  \ was used to explore central and peripheral fatigue pathways. These pathways were\
  \ profiled at baseline (BL), before the 2\_min MVC (Pre) and 10\_s afterwards (Post).\
  \ Tissue oxygenation was measured throughout the 2\_min MVCs via near-infrared spectroscopy.\
  \ The Pre to Post MVC (\u221271\_\xB1\_56 Nm; d\_=\_1.33\_\xB1\_0.51, P\_<\_0.01)\
  \ and twitch torque (\u221251\_\xB1\_20\_Nm; d\_=\_3.76\_\xB1\_0.84, P\_<\_0.01)\
  \ levels declined without differences between conditions (MVC, P\_=\_0.67; twitch\
  \ torque, P\_=\_0.39). Voluntary activation was also unaffected by condition (P\_\
  =\_0.80). Peak deoxyhaemoglobin concentrations were elevated in the IPC trials relative\
  \ to CON (3.7\_\xB1\_3.0\_$\u03BC$mol\_l\u22121; d\_=\_1.02\_\xB1\_0.46, P\_<\_\
  0.01) and SHAM (3.0\_\xB1\_3.7\_$\u03BC$mol\_l\u22121; d\_=\_0.82\_\xB1\_0.57, P\_\
  <\_0.05). These findings demonstrate that IPC does not affect central or peripherally\
  \ mediated mechanisms of fatigue during a sustained 2\_min maximal effort isometric\
  \ leg-extension task."
