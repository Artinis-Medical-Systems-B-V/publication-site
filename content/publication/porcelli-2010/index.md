abstract: "\"Central\" and \"peripheral\" limitations to oxidative metabolism during\
  \ exercise were evaluated in 10 young males following a 35-day horizontal bed rest\
  \ (BR). Incremental exercise (IE) and moderate- and heavy-intensity constant-load\
  \ exercises (CLE) were carried out on a cycloergometer before and 1-2 days after\
  \ BR. Pulmonary gas exchange, cardiac output (Q; by impedance cardiography), skeletal\
  \ muscle (vastus lateralis), and brain (frontal cortex) oxygenation (by near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy) were determined. After BR, \"peak\" (values at exhaustion during\
  \ IE) workload, peak O2 uptake (Vo2Peak), peak stroke volume, Qpeak, and peak skeletal\
  \ muscle O2 extraction were decreased (-18, -18, -22, -19, and -33%, respectively).\
  \ The gas exchange threshold was \u223C60% of Vo2peak both before and after BR.\
  \ At the highest workloads, brain oxygenation data suggest an increased O2 extraction,\
  \ which was unaffected by BR. Vo2 kinetics during CLE (same percentage of peak workload\
  \ before and after BR) were slower (time constant of the \"fundamental\" component:\
  \ 31.1 \xB1 2.0 s before vs. 40.0 \xB1 2.2 s after BR); the amplitude of the \"\
  slow component\" was unaffected by BR, thus it would be greater, after BR, at the\
  \ same absolute workload. A more pronounced \"overshoot\" of skeletal muscle O 2\
  \ extraction during CLE was observed after BR, suggesting an impaired adjustment\
  \ of skeletal muscle O2 delivery. The role of skeletal muscles in the impairment\
  \ of oxidative metabolism during submaximal and maximal exercise after BR was identified.\
  \ The reduced capacity of peak cardiovascular O2 delivery did not determine a \"\
  competition\" for the available O2 between, skeletal muscles and brain. Copyright\
