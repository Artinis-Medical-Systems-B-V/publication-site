abstract: "This study investigated the effects of four exposures to normobaric hypoxia\
  \ (SIH group; FIO2=0.120, N= 10) or placebo-control normoxia (Control group; FI\
  \ O2=0.209, N= 9) on cardio-respiratory responses to hypoxic exercise. Before and\
  \ after the exposures all subjects performed a constant power test (CP) to exhaustion\
  \ in hypoxia (FI O2=0.120) at a work load corresponding to 75% of previously determined\
  \ normoxic V O2 peak. Arterial oxygen saturation (Sp O2) and minute ventilation\
  \ (V E) were measured continuously. NIRS was used to monitor regional changes in\
  \ oxygenated, de-oxygenated and total hemoglobin concentrations of the frontal cortex,\
  \ vastus lateralis and serratus anterior. Although neither group improved CP time,\
  \ the SIH group exhibited increases in both V E (+15%; P< 0.05) and Sp O2 (+4%;\
  \ P< 0.05) after intermittent hypoxia. No physiologically significant differences\
  \ were observed during exercise in vastus lateralis, serratus anterior and cerebral\
  \ oxygenation between groups and testing periods. These data suggest that normobaric\
  \ SIH enhances hypoxic exercise V E and Sp O2, without affecting regional oxygenation\
  \ or time to exhaustion. \xA9 2012 Elsevier B.V."
