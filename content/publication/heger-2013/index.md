abstract: We investigate the potential of using fNIRS signals for biometric person
  identification. Independent sessions for training and testing have been recorded
  using 8 channels of frontal fNIRS. We extract logarithmic power spectral densities
  as features to train and test a Nave Bayes Classifier. We evaluate different frequency
  bands and report classification results for different trial lengths.
