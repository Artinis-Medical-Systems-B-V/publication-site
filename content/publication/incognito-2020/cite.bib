 abstract = {Muscle sympathetic single units respond differentially to sympathoexcitatory stress such that single units can increase firing to contribute to the sympathoexcitatory response or can be nonresponsive or even inhibited. We observed a subgroup of single units that can respond bidirectionally, being first inhibited before activated by progressive increases in forearm muscle metaboreflex activation. These results suggest convergent neural inputs (i.e., inhibitory and excitatory), which yield heterogenous muscle sympathetic single-unit activation thresholds.},
