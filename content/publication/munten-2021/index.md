abstract: " High-Intensity Interval Exercise (HIIE) has been shown to be more effective\
  \ than moderate-intensity exercise for increasing acute lipid oxidation and lowering\
  \ blood lipids during exercise and postprandially. Exercise in cold environments\
  \ is also known to enhance lipid oxidation, however the immediate and long-term\
  \ effects of HIIE exercise in cold are unknown. The purpose of this study was to\
  \ examine the effects cold stress during HIIE on acute exercise metabolism and postprandial\
  \ metabolism. Eleven recreationally active individuals (age: 23\xB13 years, weight:\
  \ 80\xB19.7 kg, V\u0307O 2peak : 39.2\xB15.73 mL\u02D9kg -1 \u02D9min -1 ) performed\
  \ evening HIIE sessions (10x60s cycling, 90% V\u0307O 2peak interspersed with 90s\
  \ active recovery, 30% V\u0307O 2peak ) in thermoneutral (HIIE-TN, control; 21\xB0\
  C) and cold environments (HIIE-CO; 0\xB0C), following a balanced crossover design.\
  \ The following morning, participants consumed a high-fat meal. Indirect calorimetry\
  \ was used to assess substrate oxidation, and venous blood samples were obtained\
  \ to assess changes in noncellular metabolites. During acute exercise, lipid oxidation\
  \ was 113% higher in HIIE-CO (p=0.002) without differences in V\u0307O 2 and EE\
  \ (p\u22650.162) between conditions. Postprandial V\u0307O 2 , lipid and CHO oxidation,\
  \ plasma insulin and triglyceride concentrations were not different between conditions\
  \ (p>0.05). Postprandial blood LDL-C levels were higher in HIIE-CO two hours after\
  \ the meal (p=0.003). Postprandial glucose AUC was 49% higher in HIIE-CO vs HIIE-TN\
  \ (p=0.034). Under matched energy expenditure conditions, HIIE demonstrated higher\
  \ lipid oxidation rates during exercise in the cold; but only marginally influenced\
  \ postprandial lipid metabolism the following morning. In conclusion, HIIE in the\
  \ cold seemed to be less favorable for postprandial lipid and glycemic responses. "
