abstract: 'High-intensity interval training (HIIT) can improve endurance performance.
  Purpose: We investigated the concurrent impact of HIIT and blood-flow restriction
  (BFR) as a novel approach to further enhance maximal aerobic and anaerobic physiology
  and performances in trained athletes. Methods: In a randomized controlled trial,
  eighteen endurance-trained males (V ̇O2peak 65.6±5.1 ml.min-1.kg-1) included three
  sessions of HIIT per week (sets of 15-s efforts at 100% maximal aerobic power, interspersed
  by 15-s recovery) into their usual training for three weeks, either with restriction
  imposed on both lower limbs at 50-70% of arterial occlusion pressure (BFR group,
  n=10) or without (CTL group, n=8), and were tested for sprint and endurance exercise
  performance. Results: The total mechanical work developed during a 30-sec Wingate
  test increased only in BFR (3.6%, P=0.02). During the Wingate, changes in near-infrared
  spectroscopy-derived vastus lateralis muscle oxygenation (Δ(deoxy[Hb+Mb]), % arterial
  occlusion) were attenuated after BFR training (-8.8%, P=0.04). The maximal aerobic
  power measured during an incremental cycling test increased only in BFR (4.5%, P=0.0004),
  but there was no change in V ̇O2peak among groups. Both groups improved 5-km cycling
  time trial performance, but BFR displayed a concomitant greater elevation in [H+]
  (11%, P=0.02). Changes in other blood variables (e.g., pH, lactate, bicarbonate
  and potassium ion concentration, hemoglobin) were not different between groups.
  Conclusion: Combining short-duration HIIT performed at 100% aerobic power with BFR
  elicited greater changes in sprint performance and maximal aerobic power in endurance
  athletes, associated with locomotor muscle metabolic adaptations but no meaningful
  effect on cardiorespiratory fitness.'
