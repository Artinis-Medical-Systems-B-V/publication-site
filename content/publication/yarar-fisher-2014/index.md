abstract: "Purpose: (1) Investigate the acute effects of whole body vibration (WBV)\
  \ on central hemodynamic responses, muscle oxygenation and oxygen consumption ()\
  \ in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) versus sex, age and activity-matched\
  \ able-bodied (AB) individuals. (2) Assess the effects of three WBV frequencies\
  \ on all outcome measures. Methods: Eleven males with SCI and 10 AB individuals\
  \ were recruited. Subjects completed three WBV exercise sessions at 30, 40 and 50Hz.\
  \ Heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), stroke volume (SV), cardiac\
  \ output (CO), and relative changes in oxygenated ($\u0394$[HbMbO2]), deoxygenated\
  \ ($\u0394$[HHbMb]) and total ($\u0394$[HbMbtot]) heme groups were obtained when\
  \ steady state was achieved for: pre-WBV sitting, pre-WBV standing, WBV and post-WBV\
  \ standing. Results: Both groups demonstrated small but significant increases in\
  \ , $\u0394$[HbMbO2] and $\u0394$[HbMbtot]; but the increases were larger in the\
  \ SCI group. A significant decrease $\u0394$[HHbMb] was observed in the SCI group.\
  \ No frequency effect was observed. Conclusion: The WBV responses do not appear\
  \ sufficient to induce cardiovascular benefits in the SCI population. WBV may be\
  \ helpful for individuals with SCI in improving lower limb peripheral blood flow\
  \ and coping with orthostatic hypotension symptoms earlier in their rehabilitation\
  \ programs.Implications for RehabilitationIncreased muscle oxygenation and blood\
  \ flow observations in response to WBV suggest a possible application of WBV for\
  \ increasing lower extremity blood flow and/or oxygen saturation in individuals\
  \ with SCI.WBV may be incorporated into the rehabilitation programs for reducing\
  \ thrombosis susceptibility in individuals with SCI.Blood pressure in individuals\
  \ with SCI appeared to be maintained much better in the upright position when WBV\
  \ is applied.This could be helpful in the rehabilitation of SCI patients by allowing\
  \ them to avoid the difficulties of orthostatic hypotension earlier in their rehabilitation\
  \ programs. \xA9 2014 Informa UK Ltd."
