abstract: "The selection of cadence during cycling may be determined by a number of\
  \ factors, including the degree of oxygenation in the exercising skeletal muscle.\
  \ The purpose of this study was to determine the degree of muscle oxygenation associated\
  \ with different cycling cadences and exercise intensities, and its putative role\
  \ in the choice of self-selected cadence during cycling. We recorded cardiopulmonary\
  \ and metabolic responses to cycling at exercise intensities of 70% and 90% of the\
  \ ventilatory threshold (T vent ), and used near-infrared spectroscopy to determine\
  \ tissue saturation index as a measure of skeletal muscle (vastus lateralis) oxygenation.\
  \ Twelve participants cycled at cadences of 30, 50, 70, 90, and 110 revolutions\
  \ per minute (rpm), each for 4\_min, in a randomized sequence, interspersed with\
  \ active recovery periods. Despite cardiopulmonary and metabolic responses being\
  \ greater at 90% than at 70% T vent , and at 110\_rpm compared with lower cadences,\
  \ vastus lateralis oxygenation was not different between the two exercise intensities\
  \ and five cadences tested. Our results indicate that skeletal muscle tissue saturation\
  \ index is not substantially affected during cycling for short periods of time at\
  \ constant, moderate exercise intensity at cadences between 30 and 110\_rpm, suggesting\
  \ that skeletal muscle oxygenation may not be an important negative feedback signal\
  \ in the choice of self-selected cadence during cycling at moderate exercise intensity."
