abstract: "Background Acute hyperglycemia reduces NO bioavailability and causes macro-\
  \ and microvascular dysfunction. Watermelon juice (WMJ) is a natural source of the\
  \ amino acid citrulline, which is metabolized to form arginine for the NO cycle\
  \ and may improve vascular function. Objectives We examined the effects of 2 weeks\
  \ of WMJ compared to a calorie-matched placebo (PLA) to attenuate acute hyperglycemia-induced\
  \ vascular dysfunction. Methods In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind,\
  \ crossover trial, 6 men and 11 women (aged 21\u201325; BMI, 23.5 \xB1 3.2 kg/m2)\
  \ received 2 weeks of daily WMJ (500 mL) or a PLA drink followed by an oral-glucose-tolerance\
  \ test. Postprandial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was measured by ultrasound (primary\
  \ outcome), while postprandial microvascular blood flow (MVBF) and ischemic reperfusion\
  \ were measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) vascular occlusion test (VOT).\
  \ Results The postprandial FMD area AUC was higher after WMJ supplementation compared\
  \ to PLA supplementation (838 \xB1 459% \u02D9 90 min compared with 539 \xB1 278%\
  \ \u02D9 90 min; P = 0.03). The postprandial MVBF (AUC) was higher (P = 0.01) following\
  \ WMJ supplementation (51.0 \xB1 29.1 mL blood \u02D9 100 mL tissue\u20131 \u02D9\
  \ min\u20131 \u02D9 90 min) compared to the PLA (36.0 \xB1 20.5 mL blood \u02D9\
  \ 100 mL tissue\u20131 \u02D9 min\u20131 \u02D9 90 min; P = 0.01). There was a significant\
  \ treatment effect (P = 0.048) for WMJ supplementation (71.2 \xB1 1.5%) to increase\
  \ baseline tissue oxygen saturation (StO2%) when compared to PLA (65.9 \xB1 1.7%).\
  \ The ischemic-reperfusion slope was not affected by WMJ treatment (P = 0.83). Conclusions\
  \ Two weeks of daily WMJ supplementation improved FMD and some aspects of microvascular\
  \ function (NIRS-VOT) during experimentally induced acute hyperglycemia in healthy\
  \ adults. Preserved postprandial endothelial function and enhanced skeletal muscle\
  \ StO2% are likely partially mediated by increased NO production (via citrulline\
  \ conversion into arginine) and by the potential antioxidant effect of other bioactive\
  \ compounds in WMJ."
