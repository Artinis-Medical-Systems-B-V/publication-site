abstract: 'The functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) technique was introduced
  for use in general medical practice to measure brain blood oxygenation along with
  physiological parameters such as 4-channel EEG, heart rate, blood oxygenation, blood
  volume changes and autonomic nerve activity. An artificial neuronal network was
  used to adjust the brain blood oxygenation measurements to evaluate changes in these
  physiological parameters. Early detection of cerebral blood flow disorders related
  to cognitive impairments such as Alzheimer´s disease appears to be feasible. Acupuncture
  with Hegu (LI4) was applied to stimulate brain neuronal networks in 5 control patients
  (CPs) and 5 brain disorder patients (BDPs). The following conclusions were drawn:
  1. fNIRS recordings of brain hemoglobin oxygenation indicate the efficacy of brain
  microcirculation and brain oxygen supply 2. Central brain acupuncture stimulation
  reveals deficits in the brain microcirculation and oxygen supply of BDPs 3. A 20-second
  period of acupuncture stimulation results in brain hypoxia in BDPs but not in CPs,
  primarily due to mismatching of arterial and venous microcirculation 4. fNIRS combined
  with subsequent ANN analysis of brain oxygen supply could be very effective and
  user friendly for recording early signs of brain microcirculation dysregulation
  and therapeutic progress.'
