 abstract = {The functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) technique was introduced for use in general medical practice to measure brain blood oxygenation along with physiological parameters such as 4-channel EEG, heart rate, blood oxygenation, blood volume changes and autonomic nerve activity. An artificial neuronal network was used to adjust the brain blood oxygenation measurements to evaluate changes in these physiological parameters. Early detection of cerebral blood flow disorders related to cognitive impairments such as Alzheimer´s disease appears to be feasible. Acupuncture with Hegu (LI4) was applied to stimulate brain neuronal networks in 5 control patients (CPs) and 5 brain disorder patients (BDPs). The following conclusions were drawn: 1. fNIRS recordings of brain hemoglobin oxygenation indicate the efficacy of brain microcirculation and brain oxygen supply 2. Central brain acupuncture stimulation reveals deficits in the brain microcirculation and oxygen supply of BDPs 3. A 20-second period of acupuncture stimulation results in brain hypoxia in BDPs but not in CPs, primarily due to mismatching of arterial and venous microcirculation 4. fNIRS combined with subsequent ANN analysis of brain oxygen supply could be very effective and user friendly for recording early signs of brain microcirculation dysregulation and therapeutic progress.},
