abstract: "Purpose: Nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability is reduced during acute altitude\
  \ exposure, contributing toward the decline in physiological and cognitive function\
  \ in this environment. This study evaluated the effects of nitrate (NO3-) supplementation\
  \ on NO bioavailability, physiological and cognitive function, and exercise performance\
  \ at moderate and very-high simulated altitude. Methods:Ten males (mean (SD): V\u02D9\
  O2max: 60.9 (10.1) ml\u02D9kg-1\u02D9min-1) rested and performed exercise twice\
  \ at moderate ($\u223C$14.0% O2; $\u223C$3,000 m) and twice at very-high ($\u223C\
  $11.7% O2; $\u223C$4,300 m) simulated altitude. Participants ingested either 140\
  \ ml concentrated NO3--rich (BRJ; $\u223C$12.5 mmol NO3-) or NO3--deplete (PLA;\
  \ 0.01 mmol NO3-) beetroot juice 2 h before each trial. Participants rested for\
  \ 45 min in normobaric hypoxia prior to completing an exercise task. Exercise comprised\
  \ a 45 min walk at 30% V\u02D9O2max and a 3 km time-trial (TT), both conducted on\
  \ a treadmill at a 10% gradient whilst carrying a 10 kg backpack to simulate altitude\
  \ hiking. Plasma nitrite concentration ([NO2-]), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2),\
  \ pulmonary oxygen uptake (V\u02D9O2), muscle and cerebral oxygenation, and cognitive\
  \ function were measured throughout. Results: Pre-exercise plasma [NO2-] was significantly\
  \ elevated in BRJ compared with PLA (p = 0.001). Pulmonary V\u02D9O2 was reduced\
  \ (p = 0.020), and SpO2 was elevated (p = 0.005) during steady-state exercise in\
  \ BRJ compared with PLA, with similar effects at both altitudes. BRJ supplementation\
  \ enhanced 3 km TT performance relative to PLA by 3.8% [1,653.9 (261.3) vs. 1718.7\
  \ (213.0) s] and 4.2% [1,809.8 (262.0) vs. 1,889.1 (203.9) s] at 3,000 and 4,300\
  \ m, respectively (p = 0.019). Oxygenation of the gastrocnemius was elevated during\
  \ the TT consequent to BRJ (p = 0.011). The number of false alarms during the Rapid\
  \ Visual Information Processing Task tended to be lower with BRJ compared with PLA\
  \ prior to altitude exposure (p = 0.056). Performance in all other cognitive tasks\
  \ did not differ significantly between BRJ and PLA at any measurement point (p \u2265\
  \ 0.141). Conclusion: This study suggests that BRJ improves physiological function\
  \ and exercise performance, but not cognitive function, at simulated moderate and\
  \ very-high altitude."
