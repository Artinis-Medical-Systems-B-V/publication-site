abstract: "We investigated the effects of: 1) Ischemic pre-conditioning (IPC) plus\
  \ a concurrent five-day heat acclimation + IPC (IPC + HA), 2) five-day HA with sham\
  \ IPC (HA), or 3) control (CON) on thermoneutral measurements of endurance performance,\
  \ resting measures of skeletal muscle oxygenation and blood flow. Twenty-nine participants\
  \ were randomly allocated to three groups, which included: 1) five-days of repeated\
  \ leg occlusion (4 x 5-min) IPC at limb occlusive pressure, plus fixed-intensity\
  \ (55% V\u02D9 O2max) cycling HA at $\u223C$36 \xB0C/40% humidity; 2) HA plus sham\
  \ IPC (20 mmHg) or 3) or CON (thermoneutral 55% V\u02D9 O2max plus sham IPC). In\
  \ IPC + HA and HA, there were increases in maximal oxygen consumption (O2max) (7.8%\
  \ and 5.4%, respectively; P < 0.05), ventilatory threshold (VT) (5.6% and 2.4%,\
  \ respectively, P < 0.05), delta efficiency (DE) (2.0% and 1.4%, respectively; P\
  \ < 0.05) and maximum oxygen pulse (O2pulse-Max) (7.0% and 6.9%, respectively; P\
  \ < 0.05) during an exhaustive incremental test. There were no changes for CON (P\
  \ > 0.05). Changes (P < 0.05) in resting core temperature (TC), muscle oxygen consumption\
  \ (m V\u02D9 O2), and limb blood flow (LBF) were also found pre-to-post intervention\
  \ among the HA and IPC + HA groups, but not in CON (P > 0.05). Five-days of either\
  \ HA or IPC + HA can enhance markers of endurance performance in cooler environments,\
  \ alongside improved muscle oxygen extraction, blood flow, exercising muscle efficiency\
  \ and O2 pulse at higher intensities, thus suggesting the occurrence of peripheral\
  \ adaptation. Both HA and IPC + HA enhance the adaptation of endurance capacity,\
  \ which might partly relate to peripheral changes."
