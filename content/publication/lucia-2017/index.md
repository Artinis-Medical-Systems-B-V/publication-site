abstract: "Objective: The objective of the present study is to investigate if changes\
  \ in the oxygen saturation of masseter muscle during a chewing task can differentiate\
  \ patients with myogenic temporomandibular disorders (TMD) from healthy subjects\
  \ and if these differences are related to the gravity of the disorder and to the\
  \ orofacial myofunctional status. Materials and methods: Twelve women with moderate\
  \ TMD (TMD group; 37\_\xB1\_16\_years) and ten healthy control women (CTRL group\
  \ 24\_\xB1\_5\_years) participated. Validated protocols were used to evaluate the\
  \ severity of TMD and the orofacial myofunctional status. Oxygen saturation in the\
  \ masseter muscle was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during unilateral\
  \ chewing of a silicon device. Data were compared using Student's t test, Mann-Whitney\
  \ test, and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Results: The women of the TMD\
  \ group showed higher total score of severity of symptoms of TMD, lower total score\
  \ of the orofacial myofunctional status, and lower oxygen extraction capacity during\
  \ mastication than healthy control subjects (p\_<\_0.01). Moreover, percentage O2\
  \ extraction was significantly related to the severity of signs/symptoms of TMD\
  \ and of orofacial myofunctional disorders (p\_<\_0.01). Conclusion: Women with\
  \ TMD had a lower muscle oxygen extraction capacity than healthy subjects: the higher\
  \ the signs and symptoms' severity, the lower the O2 extraction. NIRS proposes as\
  \ an important instrumental method to assess the metabolic alterations in the muscles\
  \ of patients with TMD. Clinical relevance: The findings could be useful to complement\
  \ clinical assessments, favoring the diagnosis and providing extra data for planning\
  \ the rehabilitation of TMD patients, especially those with associated myofunctional\
  \ orofacial disorders."
