abstract: 'Abstract  Background Astronauts have a higher risk of cervical intervertebral
  disc herniation. Several mechanisms have been attributed as causative factors for
  this increased risk. However, most of the previous studies have examined potential
  causal factors for lumbar intervertebral disc herniation only. Hence, we aim to
  conduct a study to identify the various changes in the cervical spine that lead
  to an increased risk of cervical disc herniation after spaceflight.   Methods A
  cohort study with astronauts will be conducted. The data collection will involve
  four main components: a) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); b) cervical 3D kinematics;
  c) an Integrated Protocol consisting of maximal and submaximal voluntary contractions
  of the neck muscles, endurance testing of the neck muscles, neck muscle fatigue
  testing and questionnaires; and d) dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) examination.
  Measurements will be conducted at several time points before and after astronauts
  visit the International Space Station. The main outcomes of interest are adaptations
  in the cervical discs, muscles and bones.   Discussion Astronauts are at higher
  risk of cervical disc herniation, but contributing factors remain unclear. The results
  of this study will inform future preventive measures for astronauts and will also
  contribute to the understanding of intervertebral disc herniation risk in the cervical
  spine for people on Earth. In addition, we anticipate deeper insight into the aetiology
  of neck pain with this research project.   Trial registration German Clinical Trials
