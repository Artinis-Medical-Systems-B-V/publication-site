abstract: "The monitoring of a single muscle location does not reflect the heterogeneity\
  \ of the muscle groups activation during exercise. In the past, measurements of\
  \ oxygen consumption (VO2) at single muscle locations could be carried out non-invasively\
  \ by near-infrared continuous wave spectroscopy (NIRCWS) at rest or during isometric\
  \ contractions. In the present study, human regional quadriceps (vastus lateralis\
  \ and rectus femoris) VO2 was investigated at rest and during maximal voluntary\
  \ contractions using a 12- channel NIRCWS system with an acquisition time of 0.1\
