abstract: "Age-related changes may affect the performance during fast walking speed.\
  \ Although, several studies have been focused on the contribution of the prefrontal\
  \ cortex (PFC) during challenging walking tasks, the neural mechanism underling\
  \ fast walking speed in older people remain poorly understood. Therefore, the aim\
  \ of this study was to investigate the influence of aging on PFC activity during\
  \ overground walking at preferred and fast speeds. Twenty-five older adults (67.37\
  \ \xB1 5.31 years) and 24 young adults (22.70 \xB1 1.30 years) walked overground\
  \ in two conditions: preferred speed and fast walking speed. Five trials were performed\
  \ for each condition. A wireless functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) system\
  \ measured PFC activity. Gait parameters were evaluated using the GAITRite system.\
  \ Overall, older adults presented higher PFC activity than young adults in both\
  \ conditions. Speed-related change in PFC activity was observed for older adults,\
  \ but not for young adults. Older adults significantly increased activity in the\
  \ left PFC from the preferred to fast walking condition whereas young adults had\
  \ similar levels of PFC activity across conditions. Our findings suggest that older\
  \ adults need to recruit additional prefrontal cognitive resources to control walking,\
  \ indicating a compensatory mechanism. In addition, left PFC seems to be involved\
  \ in the modulation of gait speed in older adults."
