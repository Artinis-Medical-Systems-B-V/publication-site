abstract: The construction industry makes a major contribution to the growth of cities
  and yet produces enormous waste. Construction and demolition wastes can be recycled
  and reused, but their products are still challenged by the market. Many researchers
  blame the negative stereotype of cycled products, however, people show supportive
  opinions on recycled products in questionnaires. This study designed a single-category
  implicit association test (SC-IAT) and deployed functional near-infrared spectroscopy
  (fNIRS) device for direct measurement. The SC-IAT response times, semantic survey
  scores, and fNIRS blood oxygen concentration were used to quantitatively reflect
  the implicit impression of the recycled products. The calibrated β value based on
  the general linear regression analysis and D-scores were used to capture the cognitive
  conflicts and assess the implicit stereotypes. After a predesigned experiment, a
  negative stereotype was observed based on the prolonged response time. The high
  HbO concentration level in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the frontal
  oculomotor area also suggests a cognitive conflict in the “positive words + self
  words” group. These outcomes demonstrate that fNIRS can supplement the SC-IAT and
  reveals the implicit cognitive attitudes toward recycled products.
