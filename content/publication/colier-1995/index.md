abstract: "Conventional near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), introduced by Jobsis in\
  \ 1977, can be considered as a reliable trend monitor for cerebral oxygenation.\
  \ Quantisation, however, is complex and cumbersome. Recently a relatively simple\
  \ system for cerebral oximetry (INVOS 3100, Somanetics Corporation, USA) was developed,\
  \ measuring the regional oxygen saturation (rSo2) in the capillary bed of the cerebrum,\
  \ presented as a numerical figure for easy interpretation. In this study a comparison\
  \ was made between a conventional NIRS instrument and the new INVOS instrument,\
  \ in order to obtain information about sensitivity and usefulness of the INVOS system.\
  \ Changes in cerebral haemodynamics were induced by a moderate decrease of the arterial\
  \ oxygen saturation (Sao2) and by varying the arterial carbon dioxide level (PaCO2).\
  \ This will result in a higher (hypercapnia) or lower (hypocapnia) cerebral blood\
  \ flow and subsequent change of both NIRS signals and INVOS signal. Healthy volunteers\
  \ were used for this study. It was found that the steady state value for rSo2 was\
  \ 70 \xB1 6% (mean \xB1 SD). During the lowering of arterial saturation a poor correlation\
  \ was found between rSo2 and Sa02 (r=0. 47). Increased cerebral blood flow induced\
  \ by hypercapnia was detected by both conventional NIRS and the INVOS. Decreased\
  \ cerebral blood flow induced by hypocapnia could only be detected by conventional\
  \ NIRS. It was concluded that due to the variation in displayed rSo2 and the high\
  \ amount of averaging in the algorithm the INVOS instrument does not yet provide\
  \ more information than conventional NIRS. Copyright \xA9 1995 Acta Anaesthesiol\
