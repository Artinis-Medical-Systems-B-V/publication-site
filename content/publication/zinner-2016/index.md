abstract: "Purpose: Topical application of nonivamide\u2013nicoboxil cream to resting\
  \ legs has been shown to enhance the level of oxygenated haemoglobin in leg muscles\
  \ 15\_min later. Here, we examined whether such application improves the performance\
  \ of experienced cyclists in a subsequent 4-km time-trial. Methods: Nine male cyclists\
  \ [26\_\xB1\_8\_years; 176\_\xB1\_9\_cm; 73.5\_\xB1\_12.8\_kg; peak oxygen uptake:\
  \ 50.7\_\xB1\_4.0\_mL\_min\u22121\_kg\u22121 (mean\_\xB1\_SD)] performed three 4-km\
  \ time-trials on an ergometer with either topical application of nonivamide\u2013\
  nicoboxil cream (CREAM) or cream without active components (SHAM) to both their\
  \ thigh muscles or no application (CONTROL). Results: Only the skin temperature\
  \ immediately before and after the time-trial was higher with cream than SHAM and\
  \ CONTROL (best p\_<\_0.001, best d\_=\_1.16). All other parameters evaluated, i.e.,\
  \ the average power output during the time-trial (p\_>\_0.05, best d\_=\_0.08),\
  \ the tissue saturation index of the m. vastus lateralis (p\_>\_0.05, best d\_=\_\
  0.57), cardiac output, heart rate, oxygen uptake, blood lactate concentration, and\
  \ perceived exertion (p\_>\_0.05, best d\_=\_1.1) were similar under all three conditions.\
  \ Conclusions: Our present findings reveal that topical application of cream containing\
  \ nonivamide and nicoboxil to the thighs of cyclists prior to a 4-km time-trial\
  \ does not improve their power output, saturation of the m. vastus lateralis with\
  \ oxygen, oxygen uptake, heart rate, cardiac parameters, or perceived level of exertion."
