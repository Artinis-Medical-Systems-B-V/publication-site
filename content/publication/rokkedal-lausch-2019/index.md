abstract: "Dietary nitrate (NO 3\u2212 ) supplementation via beetroot juice (BR) is\
  \ known to improve endurance performance in untrained and moderately trained individuals.\
  \ However, conflicting results exist in well-trained individuals. Evidence suggests\
  \ that the effects of NO 3\u2212 are augmented during conditions of reduced oxygen\
  \ availability (e.g., hypoxia), thereby increasing the probability of performance\
  \ improvements for well-trained athletes in hypoxia vs. normoxia. This randomized,\
  \ double-blinded, counterbalanced-crossover study examined the effects of 7 days\
  \ of BR supplementation with 12.4 mmol NO 3\u2212 per day on 10-km cycling time\
  \ trial (TT) performance in 12 well-trained cyclists in normoxia (N) and normobaric\
  \ hypoxia (H). Linear mixed models for repeated measures revealed increases in plasma\
  \ NO 3\u2212 and NO 2\u2212 after supplementation with BR (both p < 0.001). Further,\
  \ TT performance increased with BR supplementation (\u223C1.6%, p < 0.05), with\
  \ no difference between normoxia and hypoxia (p = 0.92). For respiratory variables\
  \ there were significant effects of supplementation on VO 2 (p < 0.05) and VE (p\
  \ < 0.05) such that average VO 2 and VE during the TT increased with BR, with no\
  \ difference between normoxia and hypoxia (p \u2265 0.86). We found no effect of\
  \ supplementation on heart rate, oxygen saturation or muscle oxygenation during\
  \ the TT. Our results provide new evidence that chronic high-dose NO 3\u2212 supplementation\
  \ improves cycling performance of well-trained cyclists in both normoxia and hypoxia."
