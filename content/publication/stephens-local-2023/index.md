abstract: Background Foot-related complications including impaired peripheral circulation
  and lower limb ulceration are severe consequences for those with diabetes mellitus.
  This study aimed to assess differences in tissue oxygenation and oxygen utilization
  of the plantar surface intrinsic foot muscles between diabetic participants and
  healthy comparisons following short foot exercise and a standard walking protocol.  Methods
  Eighteen participants, 9 with diabetes and 9 healthy age- and sex-matched comparisons,
  completed two interventions in a randomized order. For the short foot exercise intervention,
  participants completed 5 sets of 15 intrinsic foot muscle contractions. For the
  walking intervention, participants completed a modified six-minute walk test. Tissue
  oxygenation variables including oxygenated hemoglobin, deoxygenated hemoglobin,
  and tissue saturation index were measured using near-infrared spectroscopy in quiet
  stance and during intrinsic foot muscle contraction cycles following each intervention.
  Means, standard deviations, 95 % confidence intervals, mean differences, and Cohenâ€™s
  d effect sizes were calculated for each tissue oxygenation variable.  Results The
  results of this study indicated no significant group differences in quiet standing
  tissue oxygenation measures at baseline and following each intervention. Participants
  in the diabetic group had significantly less change in tissue saturation index during
  intrinsic foot muscle contractions compared to healthy participants after the short
  foot exercise intervention (ES= 4.00, P = .0002) and walking intervention (ES= 1.33,
  P = .015).  Conclusions By utilizing wireless NIRS and novel research methodology,
  this study was able to explore changes in plantar surface tissue oxygenation of
  the intrinsic foot muscles following a targeted short foot exercise intervention
  as well as a standard walking protocol in patients diagnosed with diabetes compared
  to age- and sex- matched individuals without diabetes. We identified that diabetic
  participants presented with less oxygen utilization during intrinsic foot muscle
  contractions performed following both exercise interventions compared to their healthy
  age- and sex- matched comparisons.
