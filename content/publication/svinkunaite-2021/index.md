abstract: Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is gaining popularity in detection
  and classification of cognitive and emotional states. In addition to hemodynamic
  responses arising from functional activity changes in the brain areas of interest,
  fNIRS signals contain components related to other physiological processes, such
  as respiration (frequency oscillations around 0.3 Hz) and cardiac pulsation (around
  1 Hz). While heart rate and respiration measures have been successfully used as
  separate modalities to assess mental workload, these components are often discarded
  in fNIRS studies during the pre-processing. In this study, we examined whether including
  features related to heart and breathing rate improves the accuracy of mental workload
  level classification. Data collected with wearable fNIRS devices from 14 healthy
  participants performing mental workload task (n-back) were used to extract features
  for the classification. Machine learning classifiers were trained and tested using
  conventional features separately and in combination with the features derived from
  the oscillatory activity of respiration and heart pulsation. By comparing the performance,
  we demonstrated the effect of including proposed features on the classification
  accuracy of mental workload. In future studies, the examined features might be beneficial
  for other classification problems where modulations in heart and breathing rates
  are expected.
