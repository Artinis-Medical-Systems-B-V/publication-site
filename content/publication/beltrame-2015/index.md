abstract: "Previous studies in children and older adults demonstrated faster oxygen\
  \ uptake (VO2) kinetics in males compared with females, but young healthy adults\
  \ have not been studied. We hypothesized that young men would have faster aerobic\
  \ system dynamics in response to the onset of exercise than women. Interactions\
  \ between oxygen supply and utilization were characterized by the dynamics of VO2,\
  \ deoxyhemoglobin (HHb), tissue saturation index (TSI), cardiac output (Q\u02D9\
  ), and calculated arteriovenous O2 difference (a-vO2diff) in women and men. Eighteen\
  \ healthy active young women and men (9 of each sex) with similar aerobic fitness\
  \ levels volunteered for this study. Participants performed an incremental cardiopulmonary\
  \ treadmill exercise test and 3 moderate-intensity treadmill exercise tests (at\
  \ 80% VO2 of gas exchange threshold). Data related to the moderate exercise were\
  \ submitted to exponential data modelling to obtain parameters related to the aerobic\
  \ system dynamics. The time constants of VO2, a-vO2diff, HHb, and TSI (30 \xB1 6,\
  \ 29 \xB1 1, 16 \xB1 1, and 15 \xB1 2 s, respectively) in women were statistically\
  \ (p < 0.05) faster than the time constants in men (42 \xB1 10, 49 \xB1 21, 19 \xB1\
  \ 3, and 20 \xB1 4 s, respectively). Although Q\u02D9 dynamics were not statistically\
  \ different (p = 0.06) between groups, there was a trend to slower Q\u02D9 dynamics\
  \ in men corresponding with the slower VO2 kinetics. These results indicated that\
  \ the peripheral and pulmonary oxygen extraction dynamics were remarkably faster\
  \ in women. Thus, contrary to the hypothesis, VO2 dynamics measured at the mouth\
  \ at the onset of submaximal treadmill walking were faster in women compared with\
  \ men."
