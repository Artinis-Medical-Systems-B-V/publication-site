abstract: 'Aims: Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive, easy to apply,
  optical technology for measuring cerebral blood oxygenation, but there is lack of
  comprehensive population data to aid interpretation and clinical use. Given the
  importance of cerebral perfusion in the context of evolving guideline recommendations
  for more aggressive lowering of blood pressure (BP) in hypertension, even in the
  oldest old, understanding of normative NIRS values is timely. We estimated normative
  values of cerebral oxygenation measured by NIRS in a large community-dwelling population
  sample of adults aged > = 50 years (n = 3110). We hypothesized that measurements
  would be attenuated by cardiovascular risk factors. Methods: Data from Wave 3 of
  The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) was utilized. Frontal lobe cerebral
  oxygenation was continuously measured via a Portalite, while participants rested
  in the supine position. Beat-to-beat BP was measured simultaneously. Normative data
  was modelled using generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS).
  Multivariate linear regressions were used to examine associations with cardiovascular
  risk factors. Results: All three measures of NIRS (TSI, O2Hb and HHb) declined with
  increasing age. O2Hb and HHb were significantly lower in males than females. Increased
  smoking, excess alcohol intake, a higher waist-hip ratio, diabetes, angina, congestive
  heart failure, transient ischemic attack and total cardiovascular disease burden
  were all associated with decreased cerebral oxygenation. Conclusion: We present
  for the first time, normative resting-state NIRS reference data from a large population,
  which contributes to clinical interpretation of NIRS and advances the use of NIRS
  as a standard clinical tool.'
