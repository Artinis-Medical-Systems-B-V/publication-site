abstract: "Purpose: To investigate the effects of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) exercise\
  \ training on cognitive performance and whether the changes are associated with\
  \ alterations in prefrontal cortex (PFC) oxygenation among patients with cardiovascular\
  \ disease. Methods: Twenty (men: n = 15; women: n = 5) participants from an outpatient\
  \ CR program were enrolled in the study. Each participant completed a cognitive\
  \ performance test battery and a submaximal graded treadmill evaluation on separate\
  \ occasions prior to and again upon completion of 18 individualized CR sessions.\
  \ A functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) device was used to measure left\
  \ and right prefrontal cortex (LPFC and RPFC) oxygenation parameters (oxyhemoglobin\
  \ [O2Hb], deoxyhemoglobin [HHb], total hemoglobin [tHb], and oxyhemoglobin difference\
  \ [Hbdiff]) during the cognitive test battery. Results: Patients showed improvements\
  \ in cardiorespiratory fitness (+1.4 metabolic equivalents [METs]) and various cognitive\
  \ constructs. A significant increase in PFC oxygenation, primarily in the LPFC region,\
  \ occurred at post-CR testing. Negative associations between changes in cognition\
  \ (executive function [LPFC O2Hb: r = \u22120.45, P =.049; LPFC tHb: r = \u2212\
  0.49, P =.030] and fluid composite score [RPFC Hbdiff: r = \u22120.47, P =.038;\
  \ LPFC Hbdiff: r = \u22120.45, P =.048]) and PFC changes were detected. The change\
  \ in cardiorespiratory fitness was positively associated with the change in working\
  \ memory score (r = 0.55, P =.016). Conclusion: Cardiovascular disease patients\
  \ enrolled in CR showed significant improvements in multiple cognitive domains along\
  \ with increased cortical activation. The negative associations between cognitive\
  \ functioning and PFC oxygenation suggest an improved neural efficiency."
