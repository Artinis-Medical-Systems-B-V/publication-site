abstract: "With increasingly complex user interfaces and advancing automation, measuring\
  \ the state of the driver has never been more important. By using sensor fusion\
  \ techniques we combine information from multiple sources to accurately and robustly\
  \ measure the driver's state\u2014drowsiness and attention, workload and cognitive\
  \ load, pleasure and anxiety. Only by integrating and synchronizing all the data\
  \ streams can we properly understand the interaction of the driver and the vehicle."
