 abstract = {With increasingly complex user interfaces and advancing automation, measuring the state of the driver has never been more important. By using sensor fusion techniques we combine information from multiple sources to accurately and robustly measure the driver's stateâ€”drowsiness and attention, workload and cognitive load, pleasure and anxiety. Only by integrating and synchronizing all the data streams can we properly understand the interaction of the driver and the vehicle.},
