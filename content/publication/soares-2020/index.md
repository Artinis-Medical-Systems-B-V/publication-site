abstract: "Although it has been claimed that rolling massage (RM), may lead to improvements\
  \ in skeletal muscle oxygenation, metabolism, blood flow, and vascular function,\
  \ scientific evidence has not yet been provided. Thus, the current study investigated\
  \ the effects of 30 s and 2 min of RM on forearm muscle oxygenation, parameters\
  \ associated with oxidative metabolism, and microvascular reactivity as well as\
  \ brachial artery endothelial function. Forearm skeletal muscle parameters were\
  \ assessed in 12 healthy young men (26 \xB1 6 yrs) using near-infrared spectroscopy\
  \ (NIRS) combined with a 5-min vascular occlusion test. Additionally, brachial artery\
  \ endothelial function was simultaneously assessed by measuring the relative change\
  \ in brachial artery diameter normalized to the hyperemic blood flow (Normalized\
  \ %FMD). These measurements were performed before and after the RM interventions\
  \ performed on the anterior forearm muscles. Forearm muscle oxygenation increased\
  \ after 30 s of RM (62 \xB1 7 to 71 \xB1 11%; p = 0.02) while there was no change\
  \ from baseline to post-intervention after 2 min of RM. No change was observed for\
  \ oxidative metabolism, however, the significant main effect (p = 0.02) for NIRS-derived\
  \ reperfusion slope (%\u02D9s\u22121) indicated that microvascular function improved\
  \ after both 30 s (2.30 \xB1 0.5 to 2.61 \xB1 0.70%\u02D9s\u22121) and 2 min of\
  \ RM (2.33 \xB1 0.4 to 2.60 \xB1 0.85%\u02D9s\u22121). The lack of significant effects\
  \ of RM on Normalized %FMD suggest that the RM did not acutely improve brachial\
  \ artery endothelial function. These findings provide, for the first time, evidence\
  \ that RM improves skeletal muscle oxygenation and parameters associated with microvascular\
  \ reactivity. Additionally, RM increased brachial artery blood flow, but not upstream\
  \ brachial artery endothelial function."
