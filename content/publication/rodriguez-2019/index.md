abstract: "This study aimed to investigate whether exercise hyperpnoea contributes\
  \ to an impairment of locomotor muscle oxygenation and performance during repeated-sprint\
  \ exercise in normoxia and hypoxia. Subjects performed ten 10-s sprints, separated\
  \ by 30 s of passive rest while breathing either a normoxic (21% O 2 ) or hypoxic\
  \ (15% O 2 ) gas mixture. Muscle oxygenation of the vastus lateralis and intercostal\
  \ muscles was examined with near-infrared spectroscopy. Sprint and recovery vastus\
  \ lateralis deoxyhaemoglobin was elevated in hypoxia by 9.2% (90% confidence interval\
  \ 0.2 to 18.0) and 14.1% (90% CL 4.9 to 23.3%) compared to normoxia, respectively.\
  \ There were no clear differences in respiratory muscle deoxyhaemoglobin (\u2212\
  0.1%, 90% CL \u22122.9 to 0.9%) or oxyhaemoglobin (0.9%, 90% CL \u22120.8 to 2.6%)\
  \ between conditions. Maintenance of respiratory muscle oxygenation may contribute\
  \ to the rise of vastus lateralis deoxyhaemoglobin in hypoxia during intermittent\
  \ sprint cycling. This manuscript presents data which extends the fact that oxygen\
  \ competition could be a limiting factor of exercise capacity."
