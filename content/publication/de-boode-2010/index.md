abstract: "Objective: Analysis of cerebral and systemic hemodynamic consequences of\
  \ ultrasound dilution cardiac output measurements. Design: Prospective, experimental\
  \ piglet study. Setting: Animal laboratory. SUBJECTS: Nine piglets. INTERVENTIONS:\
  \ Ultrasound dilution cardiac output measurements were performed in ventilated,\
  \ anesthetized piglets. Interventions that are required for ultrasound dilution\
  \ cardiac output measurement were evaluated for its effect on cerebral and systemic\
  \ circulation and oxygenation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN Results: $\u0394$cHbD and $\u0394\
  $ctHb, representing changes in cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume, respectively,\
  \ were measured with near infrared spectrophotometry. Pulmonary artery (Q) and left\
  \ carotid artery (Q) blood flow were assessed with transit time flow probes. Starting\
  \ and/or stopping blood flowing through the arteriovenous loop did not cause relevant\
  \ hemodynamic changes. Fast injection of isotonic saline caused a biphasic change\
  \ in $\u0394$cHbD and $\u0394$ctHb. After injection of 0.5 mL/kg, the mean (sd)\
  \ increase in $\u0394$cHbD and $\u0394$ctHb was 0.175 (0.213) $\u03BC$mol/L and\
  \ 0.122 (0.148) $\u03BC$mol/L, respectively, with a subsequent mean decrease of\
  \ -0.191 (0.299) $\u03BC$mol/L and -0.312 (0.266) $\u03BC$mol/L. Injection of 1.0\
  \ mL/kg caused a mean increase in $\u0394$cHbD and $\u0394$ctHb of 0.237 (0.203)\
  \ $\u03BC$mol/L and 0.179 (0.162) followed by a mean decrease of -0.334 (0.407)\
  \ $\u03BC$mol/L and -0.523 (0.335) $\u03BC$mol/L, respectively. Q and Q changed\
  \ shortly with a mean increase of 5.9 (3.0) mL/kg/min and 0.23 (0.10) mL/kg/min\
  \ after injection of 0.5 mL/kg and with 12.0 (4.2) mL/kg/min and 0.44 (0.18) mL/kg/min\
  \ after injection of 1.0 mL/kg, respectively. The observed changes were more profound\
  \ after an injection volume of 1.0 mL/kg compared with 0.5 mL/kg for $\u0394$cHbD\
  \ (p = .06), $\u0394$ctHb (p = .09), Q, and Q (p < .01). No relevant changes in\
  \ mean arterial blood pressure or heart rate were detected in response to the indicator\
  \ injection. ConclusionS: Cardiac output measurement by ultrasound dilution does\
  \ not cause clinically relevant changes in cerebral and systemic circulation and\
  \ oxygenation in a piglet model. Copyright \xA9 2010 by the Society of Critical\
