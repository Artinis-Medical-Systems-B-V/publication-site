abstract: Humans tend to align their behaviors and beliefs with their group peers.
  Establishing alignment between group members is crucial for group unity, yet the
  mechanisms underlying its emergence are under-explored. Here we examined the extent
  to which the brains of group members synchronize during deliberation on moral issues,
  and how interbrain synchrony supports alignment in their moral beliefs. We scanned
  200 participants, who were divided into groups of four, using functional Near-Infrared
  Spectroscopy (fNIRS) during discussions on moral dilemmas. Behavioral results show
  that following group deliberations, members aligned their beliefs by adjusting their
  private beliefs towards the collective sentiment. Critically, neuroimaging results
  reveal that increased interbrain synchrony in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)
  between group members predicts the degree of alignment post-deliberation. These
  findings indicate that the human tendency to align with group members extends to
  moral beliefs and reveal that regions related to mirroring and semantic sequence
  processing work across brains in coordination, to promote shared moral beliefs.
