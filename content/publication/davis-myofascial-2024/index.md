abstract: 'Objectives The purpose of this study was to compare physiological responses
  to myofascial release (MFR) and passive limb movement (PLM). Design Nineteen (23 ± 2.6yrs)
  adults (10 men and 9 women) completed two experiments on separate days: MFR and
  PLM. Participation included collecting ultrasound images, blood pressure, and heart
  rate (HR) as well as performing a vascular occlusion test (VOT). The VOT assessed
  muscle tissue oxygenation (StO2) with near-infrared spectroscopy. Experiments consisted
  of moving the upper limb to release subtle barriers of resistance in the muscle/fascia
  (MFR) and passive, assisted range of motion (PLM). Results There was a significantly
  (p = 0.012) greater decrease in HR following MFR (−7.3 ± 5.2 BPM) than PLM (−1.3 ± 0.9
  BPM). There was an equivalent change in brachial blood flow (−17.3 ± 23.0 vs. −11.9 ± 14.9  mL min−1;
  p = 0.37) and vascular conductance (−19.3 ± 31.1 vs. −12.4 ± 15.3  mL min−1 mmHg−1;
  p = 0.38). Microvascular responses differed between the experiments such that MFR
  exhibited greater area under the curve (AUC, 1503 ± 499.1%∙s−1 vs. 1203 ± 411.1%∙s−1;
  p = 0.021) and time to maximum StO2 (40.0 ± 8.4s vs. 35.8 ± 7.3s; p = 0.009). Conclusions
  As evidenced by HR, MFR induced greater parasympathetic activity than PLM. The greater
  AUC and time to StO2max following MFR suggested a spillover effect to induce prolonged
  hyper-saturation. These results may be of interest to those investigating possible
  MFR-related rehabilitative benefits.'
