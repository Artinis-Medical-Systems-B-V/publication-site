abstract: Sport-related concussion (SRC) is known to disrupt neuro-hemodynamic activity,
  cardiac function, and blood pressure (BP) autoregulation. This study aims to observe
  changes in cerebrovascular and cardiovascular responses during controlled respiration
  after sustaining an SRC. University varsity athletes (n=81) completed a pre-season
  physiological assessment and were followed up within five days of sustaining an
  SRC. During pre-season and follow-up assessments, participants' continuous beat-to-beat
  BP was collected by finger photoplethysmography and right prefrontal cortex oxygenation
  was collected using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Participants completed 5
  minutes of seated rest and 5 minutes of a 6-breaths-per-minute controlled breathing
  protocol (5s-inhale and 5s-exhale; 0.10 Hz). Wavelet transformation was applied
  to the NIRS and BP signals, separating them into respiratory (0.10 to 0.6 Hz) and
  cardiac (0.6 to 2 Hz) frequency intervals. Physiological signals were assessed for
  quality before inclusion. Of the 81 participants, 74 had a usable BP signal, 43
  had usable NIRS signals, and 28 had both usable BP and NIRS signals. Wavelet amplitudes
  and coherence were assessed. There was a significant (ptextless0.05) decrease in
  oxygenated hemoglobin amplitude from 0.062 to 0.054 Hz and hemoglobin difference
  amplitude from 0.059 to 0.051 Hz, both at the respiratory (0.10-0.6 Hz) frequency
  interval, from pre-season to acute SRC, respectively. Therefore, during controlled
  respiration, there was a reduction in intensity at the respiratory band, suggesting
  a protective, reduced respiratory contribution to cerebral hemodynamic activity
  following acute SRC.
