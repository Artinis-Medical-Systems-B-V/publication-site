abstract: 'We studied the relationship between cardiovascular status (CV) and risk
  factor numbers, macrovascular (flow mediated dilatation: FMD) and microvascular
  function using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in adults with different CV status.
  Seventy adults with different CV status (27 controls, 18 metabolic syndrome (MetS)
  and 25 coronary heart disease (CHD) patients) underwent a 5-min forearm arterial
  occlusion in supine position. High-resolution ultrasound examination of the brachial
  artery was performed during 1 minute at rest and 45 to 120 seconds after cuff release.
  Oxy, de-oxy and total hemoglobin signals (O2Hb, HHb and tHb) were measured continuously
  with NIRS on brachio-radialis muscle. FMD was reduced in CHD patients (P < 0.05)
  compared to controls. Max. amplitude of O2Hb and Hmax of tHb were reduced (P < 0.05)
  in MetS patients vs. controls. Post-deflation area under the curve (A.U.C) of O2Hb
  was lower in CHD (P < 0.01) patients vs. controls and MetS patients. Independent
  predictors of microvascular function (A.U.C of O2Hb) were abdominal obesity and
  LDL-cholesterol whereas macrovascular function (FMD) was predicted by CV status.
  Only A.U.C of O2Hb related to CV risk numbers whereas FMD was not. Although macro
  and microvascular function were impaired in MetS and CHD patients, microvascular
  function was more strongly related to CV risk factors.'
