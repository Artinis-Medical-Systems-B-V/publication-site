abstract: "Maximal strength training (MST) improves work efficiency. However, since\
  \ blood flow is greatly dictated by muscle contractions in arms during exercise\
  \ and vascular conductance is lower, it has been indicated that arms rely more upon\
  \ adapting oxygen extraction than legs in response to the enhanced work efficiency.\
  \ Thus, to investigate if metabolic and vascular responses are arm specific, we\
  \ used Doppler-ultrasound and a catheter placed in the subclavian vein to measure\
  \ blood flow and the arteriovenous oxygen difference during steady-state work in\
  \ seven young men [24 \xB1 3 (SD) yr] following 6 wk of handgrip MST. As expected,\
  \ MST improved maximal strength (49 \xB1 9 to 62 \xB1 10 kg) and the rate of force\
  \ development (923 \xB1 224 to 1,086 \xB1 238 N/s), resulting in a reduced submaximal\
  \ oxygen uptake (30 \xB1 9 to 24 \xB1 10 ml/min) and concomitantly increased work\
  \ efficiency (9.3 \xB1 2.5 to 12.4 \xB1 3.9%) (all P < 0.05). In turn, the work\
  \ efficiency improvement was associated with reduced blood flow (486 \xB1 102 to\
  \ 395 \xB1 114 ml/min), mediated by a lower blood velocity (43 \xB1 8 to 32 \xB1\
  \ 6 cm/s) (all P < 0.05). Conduit artery diameter and the arteriovenous oxygen difference\
  \ remained unaltered. The maximal work test revealed an increased time to exhaustion\
  \ (949 \xB1 239 to 1,102 \xB1 292 s) and maximal work rate (both P < 0.05) but no\
  \ change in peak oxygen uptake. In conclusion, despite prior indications of metabolic\
  \ and vascular limb-specific differences, these results reveal that improved work\
  \ efficiency after small muscle mass strength training in the upper extremities\
  \ is accompanied by a blood flow reduction and coheres with what has been documented\
  \ for lower extremities. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Maximal strength training increases skeletal\
  \ muscle work efficiency. Oxygen extraction has been indicated to be the adapting\
  \ component with this increased work efficiency in arms. However, we document that\
  \ decreased blood flow, achieved by blood velocity reduction, is the adapting mechanism\
  \ responding to the improved aerobic metabolism in the forearm musculature."
