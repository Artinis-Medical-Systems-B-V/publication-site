abstract: 'Regular exposure to uninterrupted prolonged sitting and the consumption
  of high glycemic meals (HGI) is independently associated with increased cardiovascular
  disease risk. Sitting for as little as 1-hour can impair the health of both peripheral
  and central arteries. However, it is currently unknown whether combined acute exposure
  to uninterrupted prolonged sitting and a HGI meal is more detrimental to global
  (peripheral and central) vascular health. The purpose of this study was to investigate
  the effect of prolonged sitting (3 hours), following the consumption of a HGI or
  low glycemic index (LGI) meal, on global pulse wave velocity (G-PWV). METHODS: Eighteen
  healthy participants (70% female, mean standard deviation [SD] age: 22.6 [3.1] years
  old, BMI: 25.5 [6.1] kg/m 2 ) sat for 3 hours after consuming a HGI or LGI meal.
  G-PWV was assessed by incorporating three PWV measures (carotid-femoral, brachial-femoral,
  femoral-ankle). The effects of time (PRE vs. POST) and condition (LGI vs. HGI) were
  analyzed using linear mixed models. RESULTS: Following prolonged sitting, G-PWV
  increased by 0.29 m/s (i.e., PRE vs. POST). However, the condition (P=0.987) and
  time x condition (P=0.954) effects were non-significant. DISCUSSION: The current
  findings support previous research showing an increase in arterial stiffness with
  prolonged sitting. However, in young and healthy adults, the arterial stiffness
  response was not worsened through HGI consumption.'
