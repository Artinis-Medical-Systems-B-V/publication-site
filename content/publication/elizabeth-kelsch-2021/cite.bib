 abstract = {Regular exposure to uninterrupted prolonged sitting and the consumption of high glycemic meals (HGI) is independently associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. Sitting for as little as 1-hour can impair the health of both peripheral and central arteries. However, it is currently unknown whether combined acute exposure to uninterrupted prolonged sitting and a HGI meal is more detrimental to global (peripheral and central) vascular health. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of prolonged sitting (3 hours), following the consumption of a HGI or low glycemic index (LGI) meal, on global pulse wave velocity (G-PWV). METHODS: Eighteen healthy participants (70% female, mean standard deviation [SD] age: 22.6 [3.1] years old, BMI: 25.5 [6.1] kg/m 2 ) sat for 3 hours after consuming a HGI or LGI meal. G-PWV was assessed by incorporating three PWV measures (carotid-femoral, brachial-femoral, femoral-ankle). The effects of time (PRE vs. POST) and condition (LGI vs. HGI) were analyzed using linear mixed models. RESULTS: Following prolonged sitting, G-PWV increased by 0.29 m/s (i.e., PRE vs. POST). However, the condition (P=0.987) and time x condition (P=0.954) effects were non-significant. DISCUSSION: The current findings support previous research showing an increase in arterial stiffness with prolonged sitting. However, in young and healthy adults, the arterial stiffness response was not worsened through HGI consumption.},
