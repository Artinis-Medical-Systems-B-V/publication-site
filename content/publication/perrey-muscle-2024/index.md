abstract: 'Background: In the last 5 years since our last systematic review, a significant
  number of articles have been published on the technical aspects of muscle near-infrared
  spectroscopy (NIRS), the interpretation of the signals and the benefits of using
  the NIRS technique to measure the physiological status of muscles and to determine
  the workload of working muscles. Objectives: Considering the consistent number of
  studies on the application of muscle oximetry in sports science published over the
  last 5 years, the objectives of this updated systematic review were to highlight
  the applications of muscle oximetry in the assessment of skeletal muscle oxidative
  performance in sports activities and to emphasize how this technology has been applied
  to exercise and training over the last 5 years. In addition, some recent instrumental
  developments will be briefly summarized. Methods: Preferred Reporting Items for
  Systematic Reviews guidelines were followed in a systematic fashion to search, appraise
  and synthesize existing literature on this topic. Electronic databases such as Scopus,
  MEDLINE/PubMed and SPORTDiscus were searched from March 2017 up to March 2023. Potential
  inclusions were screened against eligibility criteria relating to recreationally
  trained to elite athletes, with or without training programmes, who must have assessed
  physiological variables monitored by commercial oximeters or NIRS instrumentation.
  Results: Of the identified records, 191 studies regrouping 3435 participants, met
  the eligibility criteria. This systematic review highlighted a number of key findings
  in 37 domains of sport activities. Overall, NIRS information can be used as a meaningful
  marker of skeletal muscle oxidative capacity and can become one of the primary monitoring
  tools in practice in conjunction with, or in comparison with, heart rate or mechanical
  power indices in diverse exercise contexts and across different types of training
  and interventions. Conclusions: Although the feasibility and success of the use
  of muscle oximetry in sports science is well documented, there is still a need for
  further instrumental development to overcome current instrumental limitations. Longitudinal
  studies are urgently needed to strengthen the benefits of using muscle oximetry
  in sports science.'
