abstract: "To test the hypothesis that a system's metabolic rate and the complexity\
  \ of fluctuations in the output of that system are related, thirteen healthy participants\
  \ performed intermittent isometric knee extensor contractions at intensities where\
  \ a rise in metabolic rate would (40% maximal voluntary contraction, MVC) and would\
  \ not (20% MVC) be expected. The contractions had a 60% duty factor (6\_sec contraction,\
  \ 4\_sec rest) and were performed until task failure or for 30\_min, whichever occurred\
  \ sooner. Torque and surface EMG signals were sampled continuously. Complexity and\
  \ fractal scaling of torque were quantified using approximate entropy (ApEn) and\
  \ the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) $\u03B1$ scaling exponent. Muscle metabolic\
  \ rate was determined using near-infrared spectroscopy. At 40% MVC, task failure\
  \ occurred after (mean\_\xB1\_SD) 11.5\_\xB1\_5.2\_min, whereas all participants\
  \ completed 30\_min of contractions at 20% MVC. Muscle metabolic rate increased\
  \ significantly after 2\_min at 40% MVC (2.70\_\xB1\_1.48 to 4.04\_\xB1\_1.23 %\u02D9\
  s-1, P\_<\_0.001), but not at 20% MVC. Similarly, complexity decreased significantly\
  \ at 40% MVC (ApEn, 0.53\_\xB1\_0.19 to 0.15\_\xB1\_0.09; DFA $\u03B1$, 1.37\_\xB1\
  \_0.08 to 1.60\_\xB1\_0.09; both P\_<\_0.001), but not at 20% MVC. The rates of\
  \ change of torque complexity and muscle metabolic rate at 40% MVC were significantly\
  \ correlated (ApEn, $h\u030Ao$\_=\_\u22120.63, P\_=\_0.022; DFA, $o\u030A$\_=\_\
  0.58, P\_=\_0.037). This study demonstrated that an inverse relationship exists\
  \ between muscle torque complexity and metabolic rate during high-intensity contractions."
