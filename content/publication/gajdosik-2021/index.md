abstract: "Purpose : Although sport climbing is a self-paced whole-body activity,\
  \ speed varies with climbing style, and the effect of this on systemic and localized\
  \ oxygen responses is not well understood. Therefore, the aim of the present study\
  \ was to determine muscle and pulmonary oxygen responses during submaximal climbing\
  \ at differing speeds of ascent. Methods : Thirty-two intermediate and advanced\
  \ sport climbers completed three 4-minute-long ascents of the same route at 4, 6,\
  \ and 9 m\u02D9min \u22121 on a motorized climbing ergometer (treadwall) on separate\
  \ laboratory visits. Gas analysis and near-infrared spectroscopy were used to determine\
  \ systemic oxygen uptake ( ) and muscle oxygen saturation (StO 2 ) of the flexor\
  \ digitorum profundus. Results : Increases in ascent speed of 1 m\u02D9min \u2212\
  1 led to increases of by 2.4 mL\u02D9kg \u22121 \u02D9min \u22121 (95% CI, 2.1 to\
  \ 2.8 mL\u02D9kg \u22121 \u02D9min \u22121 ) and decreases in StO 2 by \u22121.3%\
  \ (95% CI, 1.9% to \u22120.7%). There was a significant interaction of climbing\
  \ ability and speed for StO 2 ( P < .001, ). The results revealed that the decrease\
  \ of StO 2 was present for intermediate but not advanced climbers. Conclusions :\
  \ In this study, the results suggest that demand during climbing was largely determined\
  \ by climbing speed; however, the ability level of the climber appeared to mitigate\
  \ StO 2 at a cellular level. Coaches and instructors may prescribe climbing ascents\
  \ with elevated speed to improve generalized cardiorespiratory fitness. To stimulate\
  \ localized aerobic capacity, however, climbers should perhaps increase the intensity\
  \ of training ascents through the manipulation of wall angle or reduction of hold\
  \ size."
