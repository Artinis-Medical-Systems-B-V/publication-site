abstract: "Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive technique evaluating\
  \ microvascular function. The aim of this study was to assess the reproducibility\
  \ of NIRS parameters during reactive hyperemia induced by a 5 min brachial artery\
  \ occlusion. Twenty-four healthy young males (mean 34 \xB1 8 years old) had two\
  \ microvascular function evaluations by NIRS over a 7 to 30-day period (mean 16\
  \ \xB1 10 days). Intra-subject and inter-observer reproducibility were evaluated\
  \ with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), coefficient of variation (CV),\
  \ and standard error of measurement (SEM%) for every parameter. Mean NIRS parameters\
  \ did not differ between both evaluations. Reproducibility was greatest for muscle\
  \ oxygen consumption (ICC: 0.84; CV: 6.51%; SEM: 7.11%), time to basal O(2)Hb (ICC:\
  \ 0.63, CV: 20.04%, SEM 27.22%), time to maximal O(2)Hb (ICC: 0.71; CV: 15.61%;\
  \ SEM: 19.27%), peak of O(2)Hb (ICC: 0.63, CV: 6.68%, SEM 8.53%), time to maximal\
  \ tHb (ICC: 0.73, CV: 19,61%, SEM 24.56%) and area under the O(2)Hb and tHb curves\
  \ (ICC: 0.68, CV: 16.15%, SEM 22.93% and ICC: 0.62, CV: 18.59%, SEM 26.64%, respectively).\
  \ Moreover, inter-observer reproducibility ranged from excellent to perfect (ICC\
  \ from 0.85 to 1.00) for every parameter. NIRS parameters during reactive hyperemia\
  \ are highly reproducible which enables their repeated measurement to study microvascular\
  \ function in healthy subjects."
