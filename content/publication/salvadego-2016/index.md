abstract: An integrative evaluation of oxidative metabolism was carried out in 9 healthy
  young men (age, 24.1 1.7 yr mean=SD) before (CTRL) and after a 10-day horizontal
  bed rest carried out in normoxia (N-BR) or hypoxia (H-BR, FIO2 0.147). H-BR was
  designed to simulate planetary habitats. Pulmonary O2 uptake (V? O2) and vastus
  lateralis fractional O2 extraction (changes in deoxygenated hemoglobinmyoglobin
  concentration, [deoxy(HbMb)] evaluated using near-infrared spectroscopy) were evaluated
  in normoxia and during an incremental cycle ergometer (CE) and one-leg knee extension
  (KE) exercise (aimed at reducing cardiovascular constraints to oxidative function).
  Mitochondrial respiration was evaluated ex vivo by high-resolution respirometry
  in permeabilized vastus lateralis fibers. During CE V ? O2peak and [deoxy(HbMb)]peak
  were lower (P-0.05) after both N-BR and H-BR than during CTRL; during KE the variables
  were lower after N-BR but not after H-BR. During CE the overshoot of [deoxy(HbMb)]
  during constant work rate exercise was greater in N-BR and H-BR than CTRL, whereas
  during KE a significant difference vs. CTRL was observed only after N-BR. Maximal
  mitochondrial respiration determined ex vivo was not affected by either intervention.
  In N-BR, a significant impairment of oxidative metabolism occurred downstream of
  central cardiovascular O2 delivery and upstream of mitochondrial function, possibly
  at the level of the intramuscular matching between O2 supply and utilization and
  peripheral O2 diffusion. Superposition of hypoxia on bed rest did not aggravate,
  and partially reversed, the impairment of muscle oxidative function in vivo induced
  by bed rest. The effects of longer exposures will have to be determined.
