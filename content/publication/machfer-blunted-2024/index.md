abstract: Purpose The aims of this study were to compare cerebral hemodynamics and
  maximal oxygen uptake (VO2peak) in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
  vs. age-matched healthy controls during maximal exercise.  Methods Twelve patients
  with ESRD and twelve healthy adults (CTR group) performed exhaustive incremental
  exercise test. Throughout the exercise test, near-infrared spectroscopy allowed
  the investigation of changes in oxyhemoglobin (∆O2Hb), deoxyhemoglobin (∆HHb), and
  total hemoglobin (∆THb) in the prefrontal cortex.  Results Compared to CTR, VO2peak
  was significantly lower in ESRD group (P textless 0.05). Increase in ∆THb (i.e.,
  cerebral blood volume) was significantly blunted in ESRD (P textless 0.05). ESRD
  patients also had impaired changes in cerebral ∆HHb and ∆O2Hb during high intensity
  of exercise (P textless 0.05). Finally, no significant correlation was observed
  between VO2peak and changes in cerebral hemodynamics parameters in both groups (All
  P textgreater 0.05).  Conclusion Maximal exercise highlights subtle disorders of
  both hemodynamics and neuronal oxygenation in the prefrontal cortex in patients
  with ESRD. This may contribute to both impaired cognitive function and reduced exercise
  tolerance throughout the progression of the disease.
