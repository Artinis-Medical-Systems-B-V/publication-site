abstract: 'The study aimed to assess the feasibility and potential efficacy of a non-motor
  intervention utilizing motor imagery (MI) and transcranial direct current stimulation
  (tDCS) to enhance motor function. The research involved a double-blind, randomized,
  controlled trial with three groups: MIActive, MISham, and Control. Participants
  engaged in a cognitively demanding obstacle course, with time and prefrontal activation
  (ΔO2Hb and ΔHHb) measured across three-time points (Baseline, Post-test, 1-week
  follow-up). Following a pretest, active or sham tDCS was administered during an
  MI session, while the Control group did not receive this intervention. The MIActive
  group showed significant improvements in time-to-completion immediately after the
  intervention and one week later. Additionally, ΔO2Hb levels were lower in the MIActive
  group than in the other groups. These findings suggest that the combination of MI
  and tDCS could lead to motor improvements. The study outcomes support the feasibility
  and initial effectiveness of using MI and tDCS as a non-motor intervention to enhance
  motor outcomes in short and medium terms. Further research is recommended to explore
  the impact of this intervention in individuals with existing motor impairments.
  This study contributes to the growing body of evidence on the potential of non-motor
  interventions to induce neuroplastic changes that improve motor function.'
