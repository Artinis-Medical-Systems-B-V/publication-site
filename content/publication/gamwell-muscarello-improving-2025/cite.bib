 abstract = {The study aimed to assess the feasibility and potential efficacy of a non-motor intervention utilizing motor imagery (MI) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to enhance motor function. The research involved a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial with three groups: MIActive, MISham, and Control. Participants engaged in a cognitively demanding obstacle course, with time and prefrontal activation (ΔO2Hb and ΔHHb) measured across three-time points (Baseline, Post-test, 1-week follow-up). Following a pretest, active or sham tDCS was administered during an MI session, while the Control group did not receive this intervention. The MIActive group showed significant improvements in time-to-completion immediately after the intervention and one week later. Additionally, ΔO2Hb levels were lower in the MIActive group than in the other groups. These findings suggest that the combination of MI and tDCS could lead to motor improvements. The study outcomes support the feasibility and initial effectiveness of using MI and tDCS as a non-motor intervention to enhance motor outcomes in short and medium terms. Further research is recommended to explore the impact of this intervention in individuals with existing motor impairments. This study contributes to the growing body of evidence on the potential of non-motor interventions to induce neuroplastic changes that improve motor function.},
