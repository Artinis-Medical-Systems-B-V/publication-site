abstract: "In this study we implemented a new imaging method to fuse functional near\
  \ infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) measurements and functional magnetic resonance imaging\
  \ (fMRI) data to reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics of the hemodynamic responses\
  \ with high spatiotemporal resolution across the brain. We evaluated this method\
  \ using multimodal data acquired from human right finger tapping tasks. And we found\
  \ the proposed method is able to clearly identify from the linked components of\
  \ fMRI and fNIRS where and when the hemodynamic signals are changing. In particular,\
  \ the estimated associations between fNIRS and fMRI will be displayed as time varying\
  \ spatial fMRI maps along with the fNIRS time courses. In addition, the joint components\
  \ between fMRI and fNIRS are combined together to generate full spatiotemporal \"\
  snapshots\" and movies, which provides an excellent way to examine the dynamic interplay\
  \ between hemodynamic fNIRS and fMRI measurements. \xA9 2013 Yuan and Ye."
