abstract: Purpose The present study aimed to characterize the exercise-induced neuromuscular
  fatigue and its possible links with cerebral and muscular oxygen supply and utilization
  to provide mechanistic insights into the reduced exercise capacity characterizing
  patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).  Methods Thirteen patients with ESRD
  and thirteen healthy males (CTR group) performed a constant-force sustained isometric
  contraction at 50% of their maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVC) until
  exhaustion. Quadriceps muscle activation during exercise was estimated from vastus
  lateralis, vastus medialis, and rectus femoris EMG. Central and peripheral fatigue
  were quantified via changes in pre- to postexercise quadriceps voluntary activation
  (ΔVA) and quadriceps twitch force (ΔQtw,pot) evoked by supramaximal electrical stimulation,
  respectively. To assess cerebral and muscular oxygenation, throughout exercise,
  near-infrared spectroscopy allowed investigation of changes in oxyhemoglobin (∆O2Hb),
  deoxyhemoglobin (∆HHb), and total hemoglobin (∆THb) in the prefrontal cortex and
  in the vastus lateralis muscle.  Results ESRD patients demonstrated lower exercise
  time to exhaustion than that of CTR (88.8 ± 15.3 s and 119.9 ± 14.6 s, respectively,
  P textless 0.01). Following the exercise, MVC, Qtw,pot, and VA reduction were similar
  between the groups (P textgreater 0.05). There was no significant difference in
  muscle oxygenation (∆O2Hb) between the two groups (P textgreater 0.05). Cerebral
  and muscular blood volume (∆THb) and oxygen extraction (∆HHb) were significantly
  blunted in the ESRD group (P textless 0.05). A significant positive correlation
  was observed between time to exhaustion and cerebral blood volume (∆THb) in both
  groups (r2 = 0.64, P textless 0.01).  Conclusions These findings support cerebral
  hypoperfusion as a factor contributing to the reduction in exercise capacity characterizing
  ESRD patients
