abstract: "As a relatively new physiological signal of brain, functional near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy (fNIRS) is being used more and more in brain\u2013computer interface\
  \ field, especially in the task of motor imagery. However, the classification accuracy\
  \ based on this signal is relatively low. To improve the accuracy of classification,\
  \ this paper proposes a new experimental paradigm and only uses fNIRS signals to\
  \ complete the classification task of six subjects. Notably, the experiment is carried\
  \ out in a non-laboratory environment, and movements of motion imagination are properly\
  \ designed. And when the subjects are imagining the motions, they are also subvocalizing\
  \ the movements to prevent distraction. Therefore, according to the motor area theory\
  \ of the cerebral cortex, the positions of the fNIRS probes have been slightly adjusted\
  \ compared with other methods. Next, the signals are classified by nine classification\
  \ methods, and the different features and classification methods are compared. The\
  \ results show that under this new experimental paradigm, the classification accuracy\
  \ of 89.12% and 88.47% can be achieved using the support vector machine method and\
  \ the random forest method, respectively, which shows that the paradigm is effective.\
  \ Finally, by selecting five channels with the largest variance after empirical\
  \ mode decomposition of the original signal, similar classification results can\
  \ be achieved."
