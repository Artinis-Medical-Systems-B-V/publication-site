abstract: Sustained attention is fundamental for cognition and when impaired, impacts
  negatively on important contemporary living skills. Degradation in sustained attention
  is characterized by the time-on-task (TOT) effect, which manifests as a gradual
  increase in reaction time (RT). The TOT effect is accompanied by changes in relative
  brain activity patterns in attention-related areas, most noticeably in the prefrontal
  cortex (PFC) and the right parietal areas. However, activity changes in task-relevant
  motor structures have not been confirmed to date. This article describes an investigation
  of such motor-related activity changes as measured with 1) the time course of corticospinal
  excitability (CSE) through single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation; and 2)
  the changes in activity of premotor (PMC), primary motor (M1), PFC, and right parietal
  areas by means of near-infrared spectroscopy, during a sustained attention RT task
  exhibiting the TOT effect. Our results corroborate established findings such as
  a significant increase (P < 0.05) in lateral prefrontal and right parietal areas
  activity after the emergence of the TOT effect but also reveal adaptations in the
  form of motor activity changes - in particular, a significant increase in CSE (P
  < 0.01) and in primary motor area (M1) activity (P < 0.05).
