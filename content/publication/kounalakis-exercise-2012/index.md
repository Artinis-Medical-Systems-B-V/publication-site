abstract: "The potentiated exercise-sweating rate observed during acute hypoxia is\
  \ diminished after a sleep-high trainlow (SH-TL) regimen. We tested the hypothesis\
  \ that this attenuation of the sweating response after SH-TL is compensated for\
  \ by an increase in heat loss via vasodilatation. Nine male subjects participated\
  \ in a 28-day SH-TL regimen. Before (pre-), and after (post-) the SH-TL protocol,\
  \ they performed an VO2peak test under normoxia and hypoxia. Additionally, pre-\
  \ and post-SH-TL they completed three 30-min constant-work rate trials on a cycle\
  \ ergometer. In one trial, the subjects inspired room air while exercising at 50\
  \ % of normoxic VO2peak (CT). In the remaining trials, subjects exercised in hypoxia\
  \ (FIO2 12.5 %), either at the same absolute (HAT) or relative (50 % of hypoxic\
  \ VO2 peak) work rate (HRT) as in CT. Despite similar exercise core temperature\
  \ responses between pre- and post-SH-TL trials, sweating rate was potentiated in\
  \ HAT pre-SH-TL [CT: 1.97 (0.42); HRT: 1.86 (0.31); HAT: 2.55 (0.53) mg cm-2 min-1;\
  \ p<0.05]. Post-SH-TL exercise sweating rate was increased for CT, and remained\
  \ unchanged in HRT and HAT [CT: 2.42 (0.76); HRT: 2.01 (0.33); HAT: 2.59 (0.30)\
  \ mg cm -2 min-1 Pre-SH-TL, the forearm-fingertip skin temperature difference (Tskf-f)\
  \ was higher in HAT than in CT and HRT by 3.5\xB0C (p<0.05). The inter-condition\
  \ differences in Tskf-f were diminished post-SH-TL. In conclusion, the decrease\
  \ in sweating rate during hypoxic exercise, following a SH-TL regimen, was countered\
  \ by an increase in vasodilatation (reduced Tskf-f), whereas SH-TL enhanced the\
  \ sweating response during normoxic exercise. The mechanisms underlying these SH-TL-induced\
  \ alterations in thermoregulatory responses remain to be settled. \xA9 Springer-Verlag\
