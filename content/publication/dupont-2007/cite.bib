 abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the effects of the intensity of short recoveries on performance by a Wingate test and on the deoxyhemoglobin variations. METHODS: Twelve male subjects performed a graded test and three sessions of repeated all-out tests with different recovery natures. The repeated all-out tests included two sprints: a 15-s Wingate test followed by a 30-s Wingate test. The recovery between the two was 15 s in duration and was either passive, active at 20% of maximal aerobic power, or active at 40% of maximal aerobic power. Changes in deoxyhemoglobin were measured using by the near-infrared spectroscopy technique. RESULTS: Mean power (517 ± 26 W) and peak power (1085 ± 153 W) of the 30-s Wingate test performed after passive recovery were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than mean power and peak power performed after active recovery at 20% (484 ± 30 and 973 ± 112 W, respectively) and 40% of maximal aerobic power (492 ± 35 and 928 ± 116 W, respectively). Deoxyhemoglobin variations were significantly higher (P < 0.05) during the passive recovery (12.8 ± 5.3 $μ$M) than during the active recovery conditions at 20% (4.3 ± 2.6 $μ$M) and 40% of maximal aerobic power (3.9 ± 2.6 $μ$M). CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that when two Wingate tests are performed almost successively but with a short recovery between the two, passive recovery is more appropriate than active recovery to restore the performance level. ©2007The American College of Sports Medicine.},
