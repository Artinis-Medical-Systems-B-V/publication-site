abstract: "PURPOSE: To assess the effects of the intensity of short recoveries on\
  \ performance by a Wingate test and on the deoxyhemoglobin variations. METHODS:\
  \ Twelve male subjects performed a graded test and three sessions of repeated all-out\
  \ tests with different recovery natures. The repeated all-out tests included two\
  \ sprints: a 15-s Wingate test followed by a 30-s Wingate test. The recovery between\
  \ the two was 15 s in duration and was either passive, active at 20% of maximal\
  \ aerobic power, or active at 40% of maximal aerobic power. Changes in deoxyhemoglobin\
  \ were measured using by the near-infrared spectroscopy technique. RESULTS: Mean\
  \ power (517 \xB1 26 W) and peak power (1085 \xB1 153 W) of the 30-s Wingate test\
  \ performed after passive recovery were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than mean\
  \ power and peak power performed after active recovery at 20% (484 \xB1 30 and 973\
  \ \xB1 112 W, respectively) and 40% of maximal aerobic power (492 \xB1 35 and 928\
  \ \xB1 116 W, respectively). Deoxyhemoglobin variations were significantly higher\
  \ (P < 0.05) during the passive recovery (12.8 \xB1 5.3 $\u03BC$M) than during the\
  \ active recovery conditions at 20% (4.3 \xB1 2.6 $\u03BC$M) and 40% of maximal\
  \ aerobic power (3.9 \xB1 2.6 $\u03BC$M). CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate\
  \ that when two Wingate tests are performed almost successively but with a short\
  \ recovery between the two, passive recovery is more appropriate than active recovery\
  \ to restore the performance level. \xA92007The American College of Sports Medicine."
