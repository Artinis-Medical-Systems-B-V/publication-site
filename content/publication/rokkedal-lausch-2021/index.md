abstract: "Dietary nitrate (NO3 -) supplementation via beetroot juice (BR) has been\
  \ reported to lower oxygen cost (i.e., increased exercise efficiency) and speed\
  \ up oxygen uptake (VO2) kinetics in untrained and moderately trained individuals,\
  \ particularly during conditions of low oxygen availability (i.e., hypoxia). However,\
  \ the effects of multiple-day, high dose (12.4 mmol NO- 3 per day) BR supplementation\
  \ on exercise efficiency and VO2 kinetics during normoxia and hypoxia in well-trained\
  \ individuals are not resolved. In a double-blinded, randomized crossover study,\
  \ 12 3 well-trained cyclists (66.4 \xB1 5.3 ml min-1\u2219kg-1) completed three\
  \ transitions from 6 rest to moderate-intensity ($\u223C$70% of gas exchange threshold)\
  \ cycling in hypoxia 38 and normoxia with supplementation of BR or nitrate-depleted\
  \ BR as placebo. 3 Continuous measures of VO2 and muscle (vastus lateralis) deoxygenation\
  \ ($\u0394$HHb, 9 using near-infrared spectroscopy) were acquired during all transitions.\
  \ Kinetics of 4 VO2 and deoxygenation ($\u0394$HHb) were modelled using mono-exponential\
  \ 1 functions. Our results showed that BR supplementation did not alter the primary\
  \ time constant for VO2 or $\u0394$HHb during the transition from rest to moderate-\
  \ intensity cycling. While BR supplementation lowered the amplitude of the VO2 response\
  \ (2.1%, p=0.038), BR did not alter steady state VO2 derived from the fit (p=0.258),\
  \ raw VO2 data (p=0.231), moderate intensity exercise efficiency 47 (p=0.333) nor\
  \ steady state $\u0394$HHb (p=0.224). Altogether, these results demonstrate that\
  \ multiple-day, high-dose BR supplementation does not alter exercise Journal Pre-proof\
  \ efficiency or oxygen uptake kinetics during normoxia and hypoxia in well-trained\
  \ athletes."
