abstract: Venous occlusion of the lower limbs, which simulates edema, can alter heart
  rate variability (HRV) by increasing feedback information from group III/IV sensory
  fibers. Our aim was to quantify this effect among healthy young men. The study group
  included 13 men (mean age, 20.4 years). Venous occlusion of the lower limbs was
  induced using a pressure cuff around both thighs. The effect of occlusion on autonomic
  cardiac response was quantified under occlusion pressures of 20, 60, and 100 mmHg.
  Compression was applied for 5 min. HRV was evaluated from changes in the low-frequency
  (LF) and high-frequency (HF) power of the electrocardiogram and the resulting LF/HF
  balance. Near-infrared spectroscopy of the leg was used to quantify the effects
  of occlusion on deoxyhemoglobin, measured as the area under the curve (HHb-AUC).
  The occlusion pressure of 100 mmHg induced a significant increase in the LF/HF ratio,
  compared to the baseline (p textless 0.05). HHb-AUC was highest for the 100 mmHg
  occlusion pressure compared with the 20 and 60 mmHg pressures (p textless 0.01).
  These findings indicate that venous dilation may elicit a shift towards sympathetic
  dominance in the autonomic balance.
