abstract: '(1) Background: Cerebral autoregulation is altered during acute mild traumatic
  brain injury, or concussion. However, it is unknown how a history of concussion
  can impact cerebral haemodynamic activity during a task that elicits an autoregulatory
  response. (2) Methods: We assessed cerebral haemodynamic activity in those with
  a history of three or more concussions. The study included 44 retired athletes with
  concussion history and 25 control participants. We recorded participantsâ€™ relative
  changes in right and left pre-frontal cortex oxygenation collected by near-infrared
  spectroscopy and continuous beat-to-beat blood pressure measured by finger photoplethysmography.
  Participants completed a 5-min seated rest followed by a 5-min repeated squat (10-s)
  stand (10-s) maneuver (0.05 Hz) to elicit a cerebral autoregulatory response. Wavelet
  transformation was applied to the collected signals, allowing separation into cardiac
  interval I (0.6 to 2 Hz), respiratory interval II (0.145 to 0.6 Hz), and smooth
  muscle cell interval III (0.052 to 0.145 Hz). (3) Results: Significant increases
  at cardiac interval I were found for the wavelet amplitude of oxy-haemoglobin and
  haemoglobin difference at the right pre-frontal cortex. No significant difference
  was found at the left pre-frontal cortex or the blood pressure wavelet amplitudes.
  (4) Conclusions: Contributions from cardiac activity to the pre-frontal cortex oxygenation
  are elevated when eliciting dynamic cerebral autoregulation in those with a history
  of three or more concussions.'
