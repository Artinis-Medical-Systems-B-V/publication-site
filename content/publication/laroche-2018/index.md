abstract: "Background: Although the initial anaerobic component of exercise adaptation\
  \ is unavoidable, no specific functional test is available for use in routine non-sporting\
  \ practice to evaluate it. Objective: To assess the bioenergetic and biomechanical\
  \ properties of the Short and Fast Step Test (SFST), which consists of walking up\
  \ and down a step as many times as possible in 1 minute and to analyse its ability\
  \ to explore the initial anaerobic component of effort in comparison to a reference\
  \ self-paced step test. Methods: Overall, 31 healthy subjects (19 women; mean [SD]\
  \ age, 32.4 [10.2] years) completed a test\u2013retest of a self-paced step test\
  \ and the SFST, with pre- and post-test measurement of blood lactate concentration\
  \ and continuous recording of VO2 and modelling of excess post-exercise oxygen consumption\
  \ (EPOC), near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) of the quadriceps and mechanical power\
  \ (estimated by the number of steps climbed and 3-D motion analysis). Results: Both\
  \ step tests were well tolerated. The reliability of the bioenergetics parameters,\
  \ number of raised steps, mechanical power and NIRS tissue saturation index was\
  \ good. Indirect mechanical power (estimated from number of steps) was correlated\
  \ with direct power (computed from the centre of mass). Lactate accumulation was\
  \ significantly increased during exercise with only the SFST (mean [SD] increase,\
  \ 3.86 [3.26] mmol L\u22121 from resting values, P < 0.05). EPOC was higher with\
  \ the SFST than the self-paced step test (P < 0.05). Only the SFST showed significant\
  \ correlations between number of steps climbed and EPOC (r = 0.84; P < 0.001) and\
  \ decreased tissue saturation index (NIRS) and EPOC area (r = \u22120.39; P < 0.05).\
  \ Conclusions: SFST is feasible, well tolerated, reliable and responsive to explore\
  \ a brief exercise involving anaerobic metabolism at submaximal intensity. The number\
  \ of steps taken in 1 minute seems a suitable parameter for practical application."
