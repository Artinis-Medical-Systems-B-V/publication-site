abstract: "The influence of adipose tissue thickness (ATT) on near-IR spectroscopy\
  \ (NIRS) measurements in vivo was studied in the human flexor digitorum superficialis\
  \ muscle at rest and during sustained isometric handgrip exercise. NIRS was used\
  \ for the quantitative measurement of muscle O2 consumption (mV\u0307O2) and forearm\
  \ blood flow (FBF) in 78 healthy subjects. Skinfold thickness ranged from 1.4 to\
  \ 8.9 mm within the group. Resting mV\u0307O2 was 0.11\xB10.04 ml of O2\u02D9min-1\u02D9\
  100 g-1, and FBF was 1.28\xB10.82 ml\u02D9min-1\u02D9100 ml-1.There was a negative\
  \ correlation (r = -0.70, P \u2264 0.01), indicating a decrease in mV\u0307O2 with\
  \ increasing ATT. mV\u0307O2 in the 10 leanest subjects appeared to be twice as\
  \ high as that in the 10 subjects with the highest ATT. A poor correlation (r =\
  \ 0.29, P \u2264 0.01) was found between ATT and FBF. The gender difference that\
  \ we found for mV\u0307O2 was due to the difference in ATT between female and male\
  \ subjects. No correlation was found between maximum voluntary contraction and mV\u0307\
  O2, nor between maxi mum voluntary contraction and ATT, indicating that the contraction\
  \ force did not confound our results. These results show that ATT has a substantial\
  \ confounding influence on in vivo NIRS measurements, and that it is essential to\
  \ incorporate this factor into future NIRS muscle studies in order to justify comparisons\
  \ between different groups. To facilitate such comparisons, upper and lower boundaries\
  \ for normal values of mV\u0307O2 and FBF in relation to ATT are presented."
