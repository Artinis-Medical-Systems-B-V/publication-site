abstract: Simple lifestyle changes such as improving one's diet and getting sufficient
  exercise could significantly reduce the risk of developing obesity and related diseases
  such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. However, changing eating behavior
  is challenging because eating is a part of the human behavior system. This paper
  introduces a pilot study that examined the multifactorial neurophysiological correlates
  of food decision-making behavior, with potential implications for the development
  of effective treatments for individuals with dysfunctional eating. The experimental
  protocol was designed in a virtual reality (VR) and real-life (RL) buffet setting.
  Eleven participants (aged 18-25 years; Mean = 20.45, SD = 2.30) were recruited and
  equipped with various body sensors (e.g., prefrontal cortex functional near-infrared
  spectroscopy (fNIRS), electrocardiography (ECG), galvanic skin response (GSR), eye
  movement and body motion) to capture their neurological and physiological data as
  they were making food selections. In this exploratory study, we aimed to identify
  patterns of neural and physiological activity during food selection and associations
  with the nutritional content of individuals' final food selection in VR and RL buffets.
  Findings revealed that the left inferior frontal gyrus demonstrated significant
  differential activation when subjects chose high compared to low density food in
  both settings. These findings suggest that VR simulations may provide similar neural
  response to real world environments, particularly in control regions of the brain.
