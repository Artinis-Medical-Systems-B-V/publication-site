abstract: "Background: Elastic compression therapy (CT) in patients with peripheral\
  \ artery disease (PAD) and chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) may compromise arterial\
  \ perfusion. We evaluated the feasibility of a toe-flexion test, which quantifies\
  \ dynamic foot perfusion by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), for the assessment\
  \ of hemodynamic sustainability of CT in PAD patients with CVI. Patients and methods:\
  \ In this prospective observational study, PAD patients aged 50\u201385 with combined\
  \ CVI at CEAP stages II\u2013IV were studied. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) was\
  \ measured, and foot perfusion was determined after 10 consecutive toe-flexion movements\
  \ with NIRS sensors placed on the dorsum of each foot. Knee-high open-toe compression\
  \ stockings were applied, and the degree of compression was measured. Toflex-area\
  \ was determined by calculating the area under the curve of the oxygenated hemoglobin\
  \ track recorded by NIRS. A toflex-area reduction > 20 % following CT was arbitrarily\
  \ defined to identify limbs of patients with improved foot perfusion. These subjects\
  \ received CT to be worn and a diary to report adherence and symptoms. Results:\
  \ Forty-seven PAD patients (74 \xB1 9 years; ABI 0.67 \xB1 0.24) with CVI were enrolled.\
  \ For all legs, superimposable toflex-areas were observed for the first two attempts\
  \ (ICC 0.92). Following application of CT (17 \xB1 2 mmHg), the toflex-area improved\
  \ (from \u2013162 \xB1 110 a.u. to \u2013112 \xB1 104 a.u.; p < .001). Sixty-two\
  \ limbs (n = 32 patients) exhibited improved foot perfusion after CT, with a mean\
  \ variation of 80 \xB1 47 a.u., while 32 limbs (n = 23 patients) showed stable or\
  \ worsened values. In a regression model, favorable variations in toflex-area after\
  \ CT were linked to a worse baseline toflex-area (R2 = 0.18; p < 0.001; rpartial\
  \ = \u20130.42) while the percentage improvement directly correlated with CEAP class\
  \ (p = 0.033). Conclusions: The NIRS-assisted test, which is feasible in a laboratory\
  \ context, objectively discriminates the hemodynamic tolerability of the treatment\
  \ and identifies subjects with combined PAD and CVI with improved perfusion after\
  \ CT, in spite of the presence of PAD."
