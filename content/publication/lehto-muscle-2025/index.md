abstract: Purpose We studied muscle and brain oxygenation during submaximal and peak
  exercise in patients with fibromyalgia (FM), a condition characterized by pain and
  fatigue, compared with age-matched healthy controls (CON). Methods The participants
  (FM, n = 16; CON, n = 17) undertook a step incremental cycle spiroergometry until
  exhaustion. Changes in oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb), deoxyhemoglobin (HHb), total hemoglobin
  (tHB), and tissue saturation index (TSI%) using near-infrared spectroscopy were
  assessed in the vastus lateralis (leg) and biceps brachii (arm) muscles as well
  as the brain prefrontal cortex. Vastus lateralis blood flow (Q̇VL) was calculated
  from whole-body oxygen consumption (V̇O2) and HHb values. We analyzed between-group
  differences at absolute workloads and relative to V̇O2peak. Results No significant
  between-group differences emerged in leg or arm oxygenation. Q̇VL was lower in FM
  at 50% (0.066 [0.022] vs. 0.080 [0.028] a.u.), 75% (0.082 [0.020] vs. 0.106 [0.039]
  a.u.), and 100% (0.091 [0.036] vs. 0.111 [0.041] a.u.) of V̇O2peak, but similar
  at submaximal absolute workloads. Cerebral HHb values were higher in FM at 75 (1.09
  [2.23] vs. −0.18 [1.38] μM) and 100 W (2.20 [2.96] vs. 0.06 [1.92] μM) but not at
  relative workloads. Cerebral TSI%, O2Hb and tHb were not significantly different
  between groups. Conclusion Leg oxygenation or peak exercise cerebral deoxygenation
  in FM do not differ from controls. Q̇VL was lower at peak exercise in FM. These
  results present evidence that exercise intolerance in FM may rely on other mechanisms
  than muscle oxygenation.
