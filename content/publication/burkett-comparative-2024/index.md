abstract: Importance Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a noninvasive
  technique used to quantify prefrontal cortex (PFC) neuroexcitation. The PFC is involved
  in the decision to void, and dysfunction in the region has been associated with
  overactive bladder (OAB). This study demonstrates neuroexcitation differences in
  the brain region associated with the decision to void (prefrontal cortex) using
  noninvasive fNIRS.  Objective The objective of this study was to compare PFC neuroexcitation
  during natural filling in female participants with and without OAB.  Study Design
  Female participants with OAB were cross-sectionally compared with controls without
  urinary urgency. The fNIRS signals were continuously recorded during an oral hydration
  protocol. Simultaneously, recordings of real-time bladder sensation of fullness
  were completed. A period of “high sensation” was defined as the time from first
  desire to 100% sensation. Signal analysis included removal of motion artifact, low
  pass filtering, and interpolated to standardize reporting bladder filling time.  Results
  A total of 25 female participants were enrolled and had complete analyzable data,
  including 14 with OAB and 11 controls without OAB. Change in O2Hb during the high
  sensation period was significantly lower in all PFC regions in the OAB group compared
  with controls (P textless 0.001). The majority of OAB participants had a constant
  or decreasing neuroexcitation pattern, which differenced in comparison to normal
  controls who displayed an increasing pattern.  Conclusions This study demonstrates
  that fNIRS PFC excitation during a period of high sensation is consistently lower
  in women with OAB as compared with controls. These data support the hypothesis that
  the PFC plays an inhibitory role in voiding function and that there may be a lack
  of inhibitory control in women with OAB.
