abstract: "Objectives Feasibility, validity, and diagnostic accuracy of a non-invasive\
  \ dynamic ambulatory test were assessed with near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) evaluating\
  \ foot perfusion in peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Methods This was a prospective\
  \ observational study. Eighty PAD patients (63 males, 71 \xB1 9 years), including\
  \ 41 patients with coexisting diabetes, participated. Thirteen healthy subjects\
  \ (8 males, 26 \xB1 8 years) were also studied by echo colour Doppler providing\
  \ 160 diseased and 26 non-diseased limbs. Under identical clinostatic conditions,\
  \ participants performed a 10\u2212repetition toe flexion tests with NIRS probes\
  \ on the dorsum of each foot; the area under the curve of the oxygenated haemoglobin\
  \ trace (\u201Ctoflex area\u201D) was calculated and the ankle\u2013brachial index\
  \ (ABI) was measured. Time of execution, rate of wrong tests, and adverse reactions\
  \ were recorded. Within session reliability was assessed by administering the test\
  \ twice, with a 5 minute interval between tests. The validity was assessed determining\
  \ whether the toflex area was (a) dependent on the oxygen delivery from the lower\
  \ limb arteries simulating PAD conditions by a progressive blood flow restriction\
  \ (40\u2013120% of systolic pressure) in healthy subjects; (b) consistent with the\
  \ degree of PAD ranked by ABI and correlated with ABI and ankle pressure values\
  \ in PAD patients. The diagnostic accuracy in detecting PAD was compared with examination\
  \ using echo colour Doppler ultrasound. Results All tests were rapidly, satisfactorily\
  \ (<1% mistakes), and safely performed. Toflex area values, superimposable in the\
  \ two sessions (intra-class correlation coefficient 0.92), were comparable to PAD\
  \ values following blood flow restriction, consistent with PAD severity, correlated\
  \ with dorsal pedis artery pressure (r =.21; p =.007) and ABI (r =.65; p <.001)\
  \ in PAD, but not in the presence of diabetes. Toflex area was similar to echo colour\
  \ Doppler for detecting PAD following receiver operating characteristic curve analysis\
  \ (area = 0.987, p <.001; toflex area values \u2264 \u221228 arbitrary units, sensitivity/specificity\
  \ 95.6/100). Conclusion The toe flexion test enables ambulatory assessment of foot\
  \ perfusion and PAD detection, even in the presence of non-measurable ABI or diseases\
  \ affecting the microcirculation."
