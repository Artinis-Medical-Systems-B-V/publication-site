abstract: "Previous research showed that children's physical activity is positively\
  \ related to executive functions, whilst screen time shows negative associations.\
  \ However, it is unclear how school-based sitting time and transitions from sitting\
  \ to standing relate to cognition. We investigated the relationship between class\
  \ time sitting/stepping/sit-to-stand transitions and cognitive functions in Grade\
  \ 1\u20132 children. Overall, 149 children (7.7 \xB1 0.6 years old, 54% boys) participated.\
  \ Measures included class time sitting/stepping/sit-to-stand transitions and: (i)\
  \ response inhibition (i.e., response time and accuracy); (ii) lapses of attention;\
  \ (iii) working memory; and (iv) brain activity (cortical haemodynamic response).\
  \ Linear mixed-models, adjusting for age, sex, and clustering at the classroom level,\
  \ found that more sitting time was associated with higher lapses of attention ($\u03B2\
  $ = 0.12, p < 0.05). Children who stepped more had quicker inhibition response time\
  \ ($\u03B2$ = \u22120.95, p < 0.01); however, they were less accurate in their responses\
  \ ($\u03B2$ = \u22120.30, p < 0.05) and this was also observed with sit-to-stand\
  \ transitions ($\u03B2$ = \u22120.26, p < 0.05). No associations were found with\
  \ brain activity. In conclusion, reducing and breaking up sitting may help keep\
  \ children focused, but the evidence regarding response inhibition is unclear."
