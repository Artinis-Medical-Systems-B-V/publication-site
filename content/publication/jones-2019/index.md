abstract: "Objective: Research on methods of improving the affective experience of\
  \ exercise remains limited, especially for low-active overweight adults. We investigated\
  \ the effectiveness of a virtual-reality headset and headphones in improving affective\
  \ responses over conventionally delivered audiovisual stimulation. Methods: Low-active,\
  \ overweight adults (16 women, 5 men; age: 34.67 \xB1 9.62 years; body mass index:\
  \ 28.56 \xB1 4.95 kg/m\xB2; peak oxygen uptake for men: 29.14 \xB1 6.56 mL/kg/min,\
  \ for women: 22.67 \xB1 4.52 mL/kg/min, mean \xB1 SD) completed 15-min sessions\
  \ of recumbent cycling at the ventilatory threshold: (a) high immersion (HI, virtual\
  \ reality headset and headphones), (b) low immersion (LI, television screen and\
  \ speakers), and (c) Control. During-exercise pleasure and post-exercise enjoyment\
  \ were self-reported. Oxygenation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)\
  \ was assessed with near infrared spectroscopy. Results: Higher pleasure was reported\
  \ during HI than during LI and Control (Condition \xD7 Time interaction; p < 0.001,\
  \ $\u03B7$p2 = 0.43). Participants who reported a preference for low exercise intensity\
  \ showed higher dlPFC oxygenation during Control, but this difference diminished\
  \ during LI and HI (Condition \xD7 Time \xD7 Preference interaction; p = 0.036,\
  \ $\u03B7$p2 = 0.10). Conclusion: Compared with conventionally delivered audiovisual\
  \ stimulation, using a virtual-reality headset strengthens the dissociative effect,\
  \ further improving affective responses to exercise at the ventilatory threshold\
  \ among overweight, low-active adults. Presumably by competing with interoceptive\
  \ afferents at the level of sensory input, audiovisual stimulation may lessen reliance\
  \ on cognitive efforts to attenuate declining affect, as indicated by lower right\
  \ dlPFC activity, particularly among participants disinclined toward high exercise\
  \ intensity."
