abstract: 'Purpose: Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) indices during arterial occlusion–reperfusion
  maneuver have been used to examine the muscle’s oxidative metabolism and microvascular
  function—important determinants of whole-body aerobic-fitness. The association of
  NIRS-derived parameters with whole-body VO2max was previously examined using a method
  requiring exercise (or electrical stimulation) followed by multiple arterial occlusions.
  We examined whether NIRS-derived indices of muscle deoxygenation and microvascular
  reactivity assessed during a single occlusion–reperfusion at rest are (a) associated
  with maximal/submaximal indices of whole-body aerobic-fitness and (b) could discriminate
  individuals with different VO2max. We, also, investigated which NIRS-parameter during
  occlusion–reperfusion correlates best with whole-body aerobic-fitness. Methods:
  Twenty-five young individuals performed an arterial occlusion–reperfusion at rest.
  Changes in oxygenated- and deoxygenated-hemoglobin (O2Hb and HHb, respectively)
  in vastus-lateralis were monitored; adipose tissue thickness (ATT) at NIRS-application
  was assessed. Participants also underwent a maximal incremental exercise test for
  VO2max, maximal aerobic velocity (MAV), and ventilatory-thresholds (VTs) assessments.
  Results: The HHbslope and HHbmagnitude of increase (occlusion-phase) and O2Hbmagnitude
  of increase (reperfusion-phase) were strongly correlated with VO2max (r = .695–.763,
  p textless .001) and moderately with MAV (r = .468–.530; p textless .05). O2Hbmagnitude
  was moderately correlated with VTs (r = .399–.414; p textless .05). After controlling
  for ATT, the correlations remained significant for VO2max (r = .672–.704; p textless .001)
  and MAV (r = .407; p textless .05). Individuals in the high percentiles after median
  and tritile splits for HHbslope and O2Hbmagnitude had significantly greater VO2max
  vs. those in low percentiles (p textless .01–.05). The HHbslope during occlusion
  was the best predictor of VO2max. Conclusion: NIRS-derived muscle deoxygenation/reoxygenation
  indices during a single arterial occlusion–reperfusion maneuver are strongly associated
  with whole-body maximal indices of aerobic-fitness (VO2max, MAV) and may discriminate
  individuals with different VO2max.'
