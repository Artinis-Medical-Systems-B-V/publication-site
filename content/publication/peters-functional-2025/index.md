abstract: Background Females have worse functional outcomes than males after a stroke
  including worse standing balance, slower gait speed, and higher fatigue levels.
  The current understanding of stroke recovery mechanisms has not yet been able to
  explain why females have worse outcomes compared to males. Functional Near Infrared
  Spectroscopy (fNIRS) amplitude offers information on the level of cognitive effort
  required to perform a task, as well as the impact of rehabilitation on brain function.  Objectives
  The aim of this case series was to use fNIRS to provide detailed prefrontal cortex
  activation data on several functional lower extremity sensorimotor tasks in females
  admitted to a stroke inpatient rehabilitation unit.  Methods Four female participants
  completed impairment, balance, gait, and fatigue measures as well as fNIRS assessments
  at admission and discharge from the inpatient stroke rehabilitation unit. fNIRS
  assessments included quiet and semi-tandem standing, and supine ankle sensorimotor
  tasks.  Results All participants had a subcortical ischemic stroke with improvements
  in sensorimotor impairment (average 9-point increase on the Fugl-Meyer), balance
  (average 29-point increase on the Berg Balance Scale), and gait (average 0.25 m/s
  increase in gait speed, average 30 m increased distance on the 2-minute walk test)
  at discharge. Larger fNIRS amplitudes were observed at baseline which were reduced
  at discharge for the three supine tasks, and these changes were less evident for
  the two standing tasks. Two females had decreased fatigue at discharge with the
  other two females experiencing small increases (average 0.5-point decrease on the
  Fatigue Severity Scale).  Conclusions For females admitted to an inpatient stroke
  unit, relationships may be present with improvements on clinical scores and decreased
  fNIRS amplitude during supine tasks, with standing tasks generating more diverse
  fNIRS responses. These findings suggest that fNIRS can provide prefrontal cortex
  activation data in females on an inpatient stroke unit and that a standard inpatient
  rehabilitation program appears to have an effect on fNIRS amplitudes.
