abstract: "The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of wearing compression\
  \ socks (CS) on performance indicators and physiological responses during prolonged\
  \ trail running. Eleven trained runners completed a 15.6 km trail run at a competition\
  \ intensity whilst wearing or not wearing CS. Counter movement jump, maximal voluntary\
  \ contraction and the oxygenation profile of vastus lateralis muscle using near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy (NIRS) method were measured before and following exercise. Run time,\
  \ heart rate (HR), blood lactate concentration and ratings of perceived exertion\
  \ were evaluated during the CS and non-CS sessions. No significant difference in\
  \ any dependent variables was observed during the run sessions. Run times were 5681.1\xB1\
  503.5 and 5696.7\xB1530.7 s for the non-CS and CS conditions, respectively. The\
  \ relative intensity during CS and non-CS runs corresponded to a range of 90.5-91.5%\
  \ HRmax. Although NIRS measurements such as muscle oxygen uptake and muscle blood\
  \ flow significantly increased following exercise (+57.7% and + 42.6%,+59.2% and\
  \ + 32.4%, respectively for the CS and non-CS sessions, P<0.05), there was no difference\
  \ between the run conditions. The findings suggest that competitive runners do not\
  \ gain any practical or physiological benefits from wearing CS during prolonged\
  \ off-road running. \xA9 2012 \xA9 2012 European College of Sport Science."
