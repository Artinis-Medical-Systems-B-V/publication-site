abstract: "Previous studies have suggested that a reduction in cerebral oxygen delivery\
  \ may limit motor drive, particularly in hypoxic conditions, where oxygen transport\
  \ is impaired. We hypothesized that raising end-tidal PCO 2 (PETCO 2) during incremental\
  \ exercise would increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen delivery, thereby\
  \ improving peak power output (W peak). Amateur cyclists performed two ramped exercise\
  \ tests (25 W/min) in a counterbalanced order to compare the normal, poikilocapnic\
  \ response against a clamped condition, in which PETCO 2 was held at 50 Torr throughout\
  \ exercise. Tests were performed in normoxia (barometric pressure = 630 mmHg, 1,650\
  \ m) and hypoxia (barometric pressure = 425 mmHg, 4,875 m) in a hypobaric chamber.\
  \ An additional trial in hypoxia investigated effects of clamping at a lower PETCO\
  \ 2 (40 Torr) from \u223C75 to 100% W peak to reduce potential influences of respiratory\
  \ acidosis and muscle fatigue imposed by clamping PETCO 2 at 50 Torr. Metabolic\
  \ gases, ventilation, middle cerebral artery CBF velocity (transcranial Doppler),\
  \ forehead pulse oximetry, and cerebral (prefrontal) and muscle (vastus lateralis)\
  \ hemoglobin oxygenation (near infrared spectroscopy) were monitored across trials.\
  \ Clamping PETCO 2 at 50 Torr in both normoxia (n = 9) and hypoxia (n = 11) elevated\
  \ CBF velocity (\u223C40%) and improved cerebral hemoglobin oxygenation (\u223C\
  15%), but decreased W peak (6%) and peak oxygen consumption (11%). Clamping at 40\
  \ Torr near maximal effort in hypoxia (n = 6) also improved cerebral oxygenation\
  \ (\u223C15%), but again limited W peak (5%). These findings demonstrate that increasing\
  \ mass cerebral oxygen delivery via CO 2-mediated vasodilation does not improve\
  \ incremental exercise performance, at least when accompanied by respiratory acidosis.\
