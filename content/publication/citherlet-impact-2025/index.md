abstract: Purpose Menopause results in decreased ovarian hormones, potentially impacting
  physiological responses to hypoxia and its tolerance. This study explored menopause’s
  influence on physiological responses during rest and exercise in normobaric hypoxia
  and its role in predicting acute mountain sickness (AMS). Methods Thirteen eumenorrheic
  women in their mid-luteal phase (EW, age = 32 ± 8 year) and fifteen postmenopausal
  women (PW, age = 63 ± 2 year) were examined on two occasions. Their ovarian hormonal
  levels were measured. In the first visit, hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR), physiological
  responses (ventilation, pulse oximetry, and heart rate) at rest and exercise in
  normobaric hypoxia (FiO2 = 0.14) and anxiety levels were tested. On the second visit,
  cortisol awakening response and oxidative stress markers were measured at low altitude,
  with cortisol awakening response repeated during an overnight stay at high altitude
  (3375 m) along with evaluation for AMS using the Lake Louise Score, peripheral oxygen
  saturation and anxiety levels. Results PW exhibited lower estradiol (16.9 ± 16.7
  vs 4.6 ± 2.3 pg/ml, p textless 0.01) and progesterone (13.39 ± 7.61 vs 0.06 ± 0.07
  ng/ml, p textless 0.001) levels than EW. Despite higher ventilation at rest in EW
  compared to PW in normoxia (10.0 ± 1.5 vs 8.5 ± 0.9 L/min; p textless 0.01) and
  hypoxia (9.4 ± 1.3 vs 8.2 ± 1.3 L/min) , HVR (– 0.34 ± 0.13 vs – 0.27 ± 0.15 L/min/%)
  was similar between groups (p = 0.26). AMS incidence did not differ between EW (31%)
  and PW (40%). Conclusion In conclusion, EW had higher ventilation at rest in normoxia
  and normobaric hypoxia compared to PW, but similar responses and AMS incidence at
  high altitude. Age has minimal impact on HVR in women.
