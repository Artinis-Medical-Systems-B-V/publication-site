abstract: Muscle spasticity, common in conditions such as cerebral palsy, spinal cord
  injury, and multiple sclerosis, is traditionally assessed using the Modified Ashworth
  Scale, which lacks consistency. This study evaluates near‐infrared spectroscopy
  (NIRS) as a non‐invasive tool for measuring muscle contraction intensity. Thirty‐seven
  healthy adults performed isometric contractions at varying intensities (15%, 30%,
  45%, and 60% of maximal voluntary contraction), with NIRS sensors monitoring changes
  in the Tissue Oxygenation Index (TOI) and electromyography (EMG) measuring muscle
  activity. Results demonstrated a significant negative correlation between contraction
  intensity and ΔTOI, indicating that higher contraction levels resulted in greater
  reductions in muscle oxygenation. Additionally, a multinomial logistic regression
  model confirmed that TOI could reliably predict contraction intensity (p textless 0.001).
  This technique could provide real‐time, objective data for spasticity assessment,
  potentially improving treatment plans.
