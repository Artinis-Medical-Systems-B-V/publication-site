abstract: "Executive functioning and attention require mental effort. In line with\
  \ the resource conservation principle, we hypothesized that mental effort would\
  \ be saved when individuals expected to exercise for a long period. Twenty-two study\
  \ participants exercised twice on a cycle ergometer for 10\_min at 60% of their\
  \ maximal aerobic power, with the expectation of exercising for either 10\_min or\
  \ 60\_min. Changes in activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rdlPFC)\
  \ and right medial frontal cortex (rmPFC) were investigated by measuring oxyhemoglobin\
  \ using near-infrared spectroscopy. Attentional focus and ratings of perceived exertion\
  \ were assessed at three time points (200, 400, and 600\_s). The oxyhemoglobin concentration\
  \ was lower in the rdlPFC and higher in the rmPFC under the 60-min than under the\
  \ 10-min condition. Also, attention was less focused in the 60-min than in the 10-min\
  \ condition. We discuss these results as possible evidence of a disengagement of\
  \ the brain regions associated with mental effort (executive network), in favor\
  \ of brain regions linked to resting activity (the default network), in order to\
  \ save mental resources for the maintenance of exercise."
