abstract: "Aims/hypothesis: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a risk factor for\
  \ the development of endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease. However,\
  \ in vivo microvascular endothelial function in GDM has not been investigated. This\
  \ study aimed to examine, using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), whether: (1)\
  \ there are differences in microvascular reactivity and skeletal muscle oxygen consumption\
  \ (mV\u22C5 O 2) at rest and during exercise between GDM and uncomplicated pregnancies;\
  \ and (2) there is an association of NIRS indices with macrovascular function and\
  \ cardiovascular disease risk factors. Methods: Twenty-nine pregnant women (13 with\
  \ GDM and 16 women with uncomplicated pregnancy, 28 \xB1 2 gestational weeks) underwent\
  \ arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity [PWV]) and 24\_h ambulatory BP (24\_h\
  \ BP) evaluation. NIRS continuously monitored, non-invasively, changes in muscle\
  \ oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin and tissue O2 saturation index (TSI, %)\
  \ during arterial occlusion/reperfusion and intermittent handgrip exercise. mV\u22C5\
  \ O 2 and vascular reactivity indices were calculated. Results: During occlusion\
  \ and reperfusion, women with GDM exhibited slower TSI response (occlusion slope:\
  \ \u22120.06 \xB1 0.02 vs \u22120.10 \xB1 0.04, in GDM and controls, respectively;\
  \ reperfusion slope: 0.65 \xB1 0.26 vs 1.05 \xB1 0.41, respectively), lower mV\u22C5\
  \ O 2 (1.3 \xB1 1.2 vs 3.8 \xB1 2.3\_$\u03BC$mol\_l\u22121\_min\u22121) and blunted\
  \ hyperaemia ($\u0394$TSI 6.8 \xB1 2.9 vs 9.5 \xB1 3.4) compared with controls (p\
  \ < 0.01). Despite similar handgrip strength in the GDM and control groups (29.1\
  \ \xB1 8.1 vs 26.2 \xB1 10.4\_kg, respectively), during repeated forearm contractions,\
  \ women with GDM presented a blunted TSI response (6.5 \xB1 3.9 vs 19.2 \xB1 10.9;\
  \ p < 0.01) and a reduced capacity to maintain the predetermined handgrip (23.4\
  \ \xB1 2.9 vs 27.4 \xB1 3.8%, p < 0.05). NIRS indices correlated with PWV, 24\_\
  h BP and blood glucose concentration earlier in pregnancy (r = 0.40\u20130.60; p\
  \ < 0.05). Conclusions/interpretation: Women with GDM exhibited a characteristic\
  \ blunted TSI curve, showing alterations in muscle oxygenation and microvascular\
  \ responsiveness compared with women with uncomplicated pregnancies. These alterations\
  \ were manifested during exercise and possibly contribute to the reduced exercise\
  \ tolerance in GDM. NIRS indices correlated with macrovascular indices (arterial\
  \ stiffness) and 24\_h BP."
