abstract: Hypertension even when controlled, may accelerate arterial stiffening and
  impair the ability of the cerebrovasculature to increase blood flow to support neural
  activity, i.e., neurovascular coupling (NVC). Optimal NVC depends on continuous,
  nonpulsatile flow, which is partially determined by extra- and intracranial vessel
  function. We sought to compare extra- and intracranial hemodynamics during cognitive
  activity (Stroop task) in 30 middle-aged, well-controlled medicated hypertensive
  and 30 age-, sex-, and body mass index (BMI)-matched nonhypertensive adults (56
  6 years, 28.2 2.9 kg/m 2 BMI; 32 men). Aortic and carotid (single point) pulse wave
  velocity (PWV) were assessed via tonometry and ultrasound, respectively. Carotid
  and middle cerebral artery (MCA) blood velocity pulsatility were measured via ultrasound
  and Doppler. Prefrontal cortex (PFC) oxygenation was measured via tissue saturation
  index (TSI) using near-infrared spectroscopy. Accuracy and reaction times were computed
  to assess cognitive performance. Stroop performance was similar between groups (P
  0.01). Aortic and carotid PWV increased, carotid flow pulsatility decreased (P 0.01),
  and MCA flow pulsatility and PFC TSI were maintained during Stroop (P 0.01). Our
  findings indicate that middle-age adults with medically controlled hypertension
  and adults without hypertension demonstrate similar intra- and extracranial cerebrovascular
  reactivity during cognitive engagement. Despite increases in large artery stiffness,
  middle-aged adults with controlled hypertension and without hypertension exhibit
  reductions in extracranial flow pulsatility during cognitive engagement that may
  be part of a concerted cerebrovascular response to support downstream cerebral oxygenation
  and overall NVC. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Hypertension is associated with accelerated arterial
  stiffening, which may alter extra- and intracranial vascular reactivity during cognitive
  activity and impair neurovascular coupling. Middle-aged adults with medicated hypertension
  exhibit similar neurovascular coupling and extra-/intracranial vascular reactivity
  during sustained cognitive activity. Extracranial modulation of central hemodynamics
  may be an important component of optimal neurovascular coupling.
