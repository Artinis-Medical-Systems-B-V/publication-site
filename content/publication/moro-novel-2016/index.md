abstract: Objective. In the last few years, the interest in applying virtual reality
  systems for neurorehabilitation is increasing. Their compatibility with neuroimaging
  techniques, such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), allows for the
  investigation of brain reorganization with multimodal stimulation and real-time
  control of the changes occurring in brain activity. The present study was aimed
  at testing a novel semi-immersive visuo-motor task (VMT), which has the features
  of being adopted in the field of neurorehabilitation of the upper limb motor function.
  Approach. A virtual environment was simulated through a three-dimensional hand-sensing
  device (the LEAP Motion Controller), and the concomitant VMT-related prefrontal
  cortex (PFC) response was monitored non-invasively by fNIRS. Upon the VMT, performed
  at three different levels of difficulty, it was hypothesized that the PFC would
  be activated with an expected greater level of activation in the ventrolateral PFC
  (VLPFC), given its involvement in the motor action planning and in the allocation
  of the attentional resources to generate goals from current contexts. Twenty-one
  subjects were asked to move their right hand/forearm with the purpose of guiding
  a virtual sphere over a virtual path. A twenty-channel fNIRS system was employed
  for measuring changes in PFC oxygenated-deoxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb/HHb, respectively).
  Main results. A VLPFC O2Hb increase and a concomitant HHb decrease were observed
  during the VMT performance, without any difference in relation to the task difficulty.
  Significance. The present study has revealed a particular involvement of the VLPFC
  in the execution of the novel proposed semi-immersive VMT adoptable in the neurorehabilitation
  field.
