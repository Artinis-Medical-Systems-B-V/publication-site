abstract: "This study examined the effects of post-exercise cooling on recovery of\
  \ neuromuscular, physiological, and cerebral hemodynamic responses after intermittent-sprint\
  \ exercise in the heat. Nine participants underwent three post-exercise recovery\
  \ trials, including a control (CONT), mixed-method cooling (MIX), and cold-water\
  \ immersion (10\xB0C; CWI). Voluntary force and activation were assessed simultaneously\
  \ with cerebral oxygenation (near-infrared spectroscopy) pre- and post-exercise,\
  \ post-intervention, and 1-h and 24-h post-exercise. Measures of heart rate, core\
  \ temperature, skin temperature, muscle damage, and inflammation were also collected.\
  \ Both cooling interventions reduced heart rate, core, and skin temperature post-intervention\
  \ (P<0.05). CWI hastened the recovery of voluntary force by 12.7\xB111.7% (mean\xB1\
  SD) and 16.3\xB110.5% 1-h post-exercise compared to MIX and CONT, respectively (P<0.01).\
  \ Voluntary force remained elevated by 16.1\xB120.5% 24-h post-exercise after CWI\
  \ compared to CONT (P<0.05). Central activation was increased post-intervention\
  \ and 1-h post-exercise with CWI compared to CONT (P<0.05), without differences\
  \ between conditions 24-h post-exercise (P>0.05). CWI reduced cerebral oxygenation\
  \ compared to MIX and CONT post-intervention (P<0.01). Furthermore, cooling interventions\
  \ reduced cortisol 1-h post-exercise (P<0.01), although only CWI blunted creatine\
  \ kinase 24-h post-exercise compared to CONT (P<0.05). Accordingly, improvements\
  \ in neuromuscular recovery after post-exercise cooling appear to be disassociated\
  \ with cerebral oxygenation, rather reflecting reductions in thermoregulatory demands\
  \ to sustain force production. \xA9 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John\
