abstract: "Respiratory limitation can be a primary mechanism for exercise cessation\
  \ in female athletes. This study aimed to assess the effects of inspiratory loading\
  \ (IL) on intercostal muscles (IM), vastus lateralis (VL) and cerebral (Cox) muscles\
  \ oxygenation in women soccer players during high-intensity dynamic exercise. Ten\
  \ female soccer players were randomized to perform in order two constant-load tests\
  \ on a treadmill until the exhaustion time (Tlim) (100 % of maximal oxygen uptake-\
  \ V\u02D9O2). They breathed freely or against a fixed inspiratory loading (IL) of\
  \ 41 cm H2O (\u223C30 % of maximal inspiratory pressure). Oxygenated ($\u0394$[OxyHb]),\
  \ deoxygenated ($\u0394$[DeoxyHb]), total hemoglobin ($\u0394$[tHb]) and tissue\
  \ saturation index ($\u0394$TSI) were obtained by NIRs. Also, blood lactate [La\u2014\
  ] was obtained. IL significantly reduced Tlim (224 \xB1 54 vs 78 \xB1 20; P < 0.05)\
  \ and increased [La\u2014], V\u02D9O2, respiratory cycles and dyspnea when corrected\
  \ to Tlim (P < 0.05). IL also resulted in decrease of $\u0394$[OxyHb] of Cox and\
  \ IM during exercise compared with rest condition. In addition, decrease of $\u0394\
  $[OxyHb] was observed on IM during exercise when contrasted with Sham (P < 0.05).\
  \ Furthermore, significant higher $\u0394$[DeoxyHb] of IM and significant lower\
  \ $\u0394$[DeoxyHb] of Cox were observed when IL was applied during exercise in\
  \ contrast with Sham (P < 0.05). These results were accompanied with significant\
  \ reduction of $\u0394$[tHb] and $\u0394$TSI of IM and VL when IL was applied (P\
  \ < 0.05). High-intensity exercise with IL decreased respiratory and peripheral\
  \ muscle oxygenation with negative impact on exercise performance. However, the\
  \ increase in ventilatory work did not impact cerebral oxygenation in soccer players."
