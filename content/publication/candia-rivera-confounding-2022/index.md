abstract: Abstract Recent studies have established that cardiac and respiratory phases
  can modulate perception and related neural dynamics. While heart rate and respiratory
  sinus arrhythmia possibly affect interoception biomarkers, such as heartbeat-evoked
  potentials, the relative changes in heart rate and cardiorespiratory dynamics in
  interoceptive processes have not yet been investigated. In this study, we investigated
  the variation in heart and breathing rates, as well as higher functional dynamics
  including cardiorespiratory correlation and frontal hemodynamics measured with fNIRS,
  during a heartbeat counting task. To further investigate the functional physiology
  linked to changes in vagal activity caused by specific breathing rates, we performed
  the heartbeat counting task together with a controlled breathing rate task. The
  results demonstrate that focusing on heartbeats decreases breathing and heart rates
  in comparison, which may be part of the physiological mechanisms related to “listening”
  to the heart, the focus of attention, and self-awareness. Focusing on heartbeats
  was also observed to increase frontal connectivity, supporting the role of frontal
  structures in the neural monitoring of visceral inputs. However, cardiorespiratory
  correlation is affected by both heartbeats counting and controlled breathing tasks.
  Based on these results, we concluded that variations in heart and breathing rates
  are confounding factors in the assessment of interoceptive abilities and relative
  fluctuations in breathing and heart rates should be considered to be a mode of covariate
  measurement of interoceptive processes.
