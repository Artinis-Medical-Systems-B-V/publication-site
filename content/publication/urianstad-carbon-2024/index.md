abstract: 'Altitude training is a cornerstone for endurance athletes for improving
  blood variables and performance with optimal effects observed at ⁓2300-2500 meters
  above sea level (m.a.s.l.). However, elite cyclists face challenges such as limited
  access to such altitudes, inadequate training facilities, and high expenses. To
  address these issues, a novel method involving daily exposure to carbon monoxide
  (CO) has been proposed to amplify altitude training adaptations at suboptimal altitudes.
  Thirty-one male cyclists were assigned to three groups: Live-High and Train-High
  with CO inhalation (LHTHCO), Live-High Train-High (LHTH), and Live-Low Train-Low
  (LLTL). The LHTHCO group underwent CO inhalation twice daily in the afternoon/evening
  to elevate carboxyhemoglobin concentration to ⁓10%. Hematological variables, in-vivo
  muscle oxidative capacity, and physiological indicators of cycling performance were
  assessed before and after a 3-week altitude training camp at 2100 m.a.s.l. LHTHCO
  demonstrated a larger increase in hemoglobin mass (Hbmass) compared to both LHTH
  and LLTL. While there were no statistical differences between LHTHCO and LHTH in
  submaximal and maximal performance measures, LHTHCO displayed greater improvements
  in 1-min maximal power output during incremental testing (Wmax), power output at
  lactate threshold, and maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) compared to LLTL. LHTH
  demonstrated a larger improvement than LLTL in Wmax andVO2maxwith no group differences
  in Hbmass or submaximal measures. Muscle oxidative capacity did not differ between
  groups. These findings suggest that combining moderate altitude training with daily
  CO inhalation promotes hematological adaptations more effectively than moderate
  altitude alone and enhances cycling performance metrics in cyclists more than sea-level
  training.'
