abstract: "Purpose: To compare prefrontal cortex oxygenation in recreationally-active\
  \ women using oral contraceptives (WomenOC; n = 8) to women with a natural menstrual\
  \ cycle (WomenNC; n = 8) during incremental exercise to exhaustion. Methods: Participants\
  \ performed incremental cycling to exhaustion to determine lactate threshold 1 (LT1)\
  \ and 2 (LT2) and peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak). Prefrontal cortex oxygenation was\
  \ monitored via near-infrared spectroscopy through concentration changes in oxy-haemoglobin\
  \ ($\u0394$[HbO2]), deoxy-haemoglobin ($\u0394$[HHb]), total-haemoglobin ($\u0394\
  $[tHb]) and tissue saturation index (TSI). Results: 17$\u03B2$-oestradiol and progesterone\
  \ were lower in WomenOC (35\_\xB1\_26; 318\_\xB1\_127\_pmol\u02D9L\u22121, respectively)\
  \ than WomenNC (261\_\xB1\_156; 858\_\xB1\_541\_pmol\u02D9L\u22121, respectively).\
  \ There were no differences in full blood examination results or serum nitric oxide\
  \ (p > 0.05). However, WomenOC presented lower concentrations in ferric-reducing\
  \ ability of plasma (\u2212 8%; effect size; ES \u2212 0.52 \xB1 0.61), bilirubin\
  \ (\u2212 32%; ES \u2212 0.56 \xB1 0.62) and uric acid (\u2212 17%; ES \u2212 0.53\
  \ \xB1 0.61). Cardiopulmonary parameters were similar between groups during cycling,\
  \ including VO2peak (p = 0.99). While there was a significant effect of time on\
  \ all parameters measured by near-infrared spectroscopy during incremental cycling,\
  \ there was no effect of OC at LT1, LT2 or exhaustion calculated as a change from\
  \ baseline (TSI; p = 0.096, $\u0394$[HbO2]; p = 0.143, $\u0394$[HHb]; p = 0.085\
  \ and $\u0394$[tHb]; p = 0.226). The change in TSI from LT1 to LT2 was significantly\
  \ different between groups (WomenNC; mean difference + 2.06%, WomenOC; mean difference\
  \ \u2212 1.73%; p = 0.003). Conclusion: Prefrontal tissue oxygenation declined at\
  \ a lower relative exercise intensity in WomenOC as compared to WomenNC, however,\
  \ this did not influence VO2peak. The results provide the first evidence for variance\
  \ in the cerebral oxygenation response to exercise, which may be associated with\
  \ female sex hormones."
