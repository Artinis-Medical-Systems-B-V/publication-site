abstract: "Wearable, wireless near-infrared (NIR) spectrometers were used to compare\
  \ changes in on-ice short-track skating race simulations over 1,500 m with a 3-min\
  \ cycle ergometry test at constant power output (400 W). The subjects were six male\
  \ elite short-track speed skaters. Both protocols elicited a rapid desaturation\
  \ (TSI%) in the muscle during early stages (initial 20 s); however, asymmetry between\
  \ right and left legs was seen in $\u0394$TSI% for the skating protocol, but not\
  \ for cycling. Individual differences between skaters were present in both protocols.\
  \ Notably, one individual who showed a relatively small TSI% change (-10.7%, group\
  \ mean =-26.1%) showed a similarly small change during the cycling protocol (-5.8%,\
  \ group mean =-14.3%). We conclude that NIRS-detected leg asymmetry is due to the\
  \ specific demands of short-track speed skating. However, heterogeneity between\
  \ individuals is not specific to the mode of exercise. Whether this is a result\
  \ of genuine differences in physiology or a reflection of differences in the optical\
  \ properties of the leg remains to be determined. \xA9 2013 Springer Science+Business\
