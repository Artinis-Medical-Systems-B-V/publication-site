 abstract = {Dietary nitrate (BR) and caffeine (CAF) ingestion have been shown to increase sports performance. However, the isolated and combined effects of BR and CAF ingestion on time trial (TT) performance as well as the accompanying physiological and perceptual responses have never been investigated in highly trained kayak athletes. Therefore, the present study examined the impact of an isolated and combined supplementation with BR (140 ml beetroot concentrate, ~12.5 mmol nitrate) and CAF (3 mg/kg bodyweight) on 1000 m ergometer TT performance as well as the accompanying physiological (i.e. cardiorespiratory function, muscle oxygenation, muscle activity) and perceptual responses (i.e. fatigue, effort, and exercise-induced pain perception) in male highly trained kayakers. It was hypothesized that the isolated ingestion of BR and CAF would both improve ergometer-based 1000 m TT performance and induce supplement-specific physiological and perceptual responses. Considering the primary effects of BR on muscle function and of CAF on the central nervous system, it was further assumed that the combined ingestion will result in an additional performance increase and supplement-specific physiological and perceptual responses.},
