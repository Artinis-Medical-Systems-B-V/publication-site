abstract: Dietary nitrate (BR) and caffeine (CAF) ingestion have been shown to increase
  sports performance. However, the isolated and combined effects of BR and CAF ingestion
  on time trial (TT) performance as well as the accompanying physiological and perceptual
  responses have never been investigated in highly trained kayak athletes. Therefore,
  the present study examined the impact of an isolated and combined supplementation
  with BR (140 ml beetroot concentrate, ~12.5 mmol nitrate) and CAF (3 mg/kg bodyweight)
  on 1000 m ergometer TT performance as well as the accompanying physiological (i.e.
  cardiorespiratory function, muscle oxygenation, muscle activity) and perceptual
  responses (i.e. fatigue, effort, and exercise-induced pain perception) in male highly
  trained kayakers. It was hypothesized that the isolated ingestion of BR and CAF
  would both improve ergometer-based 1000 m TT performance and induce supplement-specific
  physiological and perceptual responses. Considering the primary effects of BR on
  muscle function and of CAF on the central nervous system, it was further assumed
  that the combined ingestion will result in an additional performance increase and
  supplement-specific physiological and perceptual responses.
