abstract: 'Objective: To compare peripheral muscle oxygenation levels and the prevalence
  of psychological stress in adolescents with and without temporomandibular disorder
  (TMD).  Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed with adolescents submitted
  into two groups: those diagnosed with TMD (DG) and control (CG). Muscle oxygenation
  was measured by near-infrared spectroscopy in the masseter and upper trapezius muscles.
  Symptoms of stress were assessed by Lipp''s Stress Symptom Inventory for Adults
  or Child Stress Scale. A Student t-test was used for intergroup comparisons and
  association between categorical variables by chi-square test, phi coefficient of
  correlation, odds ratio, and two-way ANOVA.  Results: Fifty-three adolescents were
  evaluated and a significant reduction was observed in the oxyhemoglobin level in
  the masseter muscle at rest (p = 0.04) and contraction (p = 0.02). A greater total
  hemoglobin level was found in the upper trapezius muscle at rest in DG (p = 0.03),
  with a significant difference in the tissue saturation index during contraction
  (p = 0.05) intergroup. Individuals in the DG were 4.523 times more likely to exhibit
  signs and symptoms of stress than in CG.  Conclusion: Adolescents from DG showed
  reduced masseter oxyhemoglobin values at rest and during contraction and showed
  more signs and symptoms of stress than healthy controls. In the upper trapezius,
  DG showed higher values of total circulating hemoglobin, essential for greater blood
  flow and efficient maximum voluntary contraction.  Clinical relevance: Changes in
  tissue oxygenation and stress in adolescents with TMD prompted the earlier treatment
  of this population to prevent disease progression into adulthood.  Keywords: Muscle
  oxygenation; Near-infrared; Psychological stress; Spectroscopy; Teenagers; Temporomandibular
  joint disorder(s).'
