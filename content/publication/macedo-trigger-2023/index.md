abstract: 'Background: Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is an umbrella term encompassing
  various clinical complaints involving the temporomandibular joints, masticatory
  muscles, and/or associated orofacial structures. Myogenous TMDs are the most frequent
  cause of chronic orofacial pain. Musculoskeletal pain is commonly associated with
  myofascial trigger points (MTPs), for which dry needling (DN) is a routine treatment.  Objective:
  To investigate muscle oxygenation and pain immediately after DN application on an
  MTP in the masseter muscle of patients with myogenous TMDs.  Methodology: Masseter
  muscle oxygen tissue saturation indices (TSI%) were assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy
  (NIRS) pre- and post-interventions by a randomized, controlled, double-blind, crossover
  DN/Sham clinical trial (primary outcome). Pain was investigated by the visual analog
  scale (VAS). In total, 32 individuals aged from 18 to 37 years who were diagnosed
  with myogenous TMD and myofascial trigger points in their masseter muscles participated
  in this study. Relative deltas for the studied variables were calculated. Data normality
  was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test. According to their distribution, data were
  analyzed by two-way ANOVA and the Student''s t-, and Mann-Whitney tests. Statistical
  analyses were performed using Prism® 5.0 (GraphPad, USA).  Results: We found a significant
  difference (2,108% vs. 0,142%) between masseter muscle TSI% deltas after the DN
  and Sham interventions, respectively (n=24). We only evaluated women since men refused
  to follow NIRS procedures. Pain increased immediately after DN (n=32, 8 men), in
  comparison to Sham delta VAS.  Conclusion: These findings show an increase in tissue
  oxygen saturation in the evaluated sample immediately after the DN intervention
  on the MTP of patients’ masseter muscle. Pain may have increased immediately after
  DN due to the needling procedure.'
