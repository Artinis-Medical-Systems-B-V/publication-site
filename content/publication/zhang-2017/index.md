abstract: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), which can measure cortex
  hemoglobin activity, has been widely adopted in brain-computer interface (BCI).
  To explore the feasibility of recognizing motor imagery (MI) and motor execution
  (ME) in the same motion. We measured changes of oxygenated hemoglobin (HBO) and
  deoxygenated hemoglobin (HBR) on PFC and Motor Cortex (MC) when 15 subjects performing
  hand extension and finger tapping tasks. The mean, slope, quadratic coefficient
  and approximate entropy features were extracted from HBO as the input of support
  vector machine (SVM). For the four-class fNIRS-BCI classifiers, we realized 87.65%
  and 87.58% classification accuracy corresponding to hand extension and finger tapping
  tasks. In conclusion, it is effective for fNIRS-BCI to recognize MI and ME in the
  same motion.
