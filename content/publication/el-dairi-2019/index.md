abstract: Optic nerve hypoplasia is a congenital anomaly in which the optic disc is
  abnormally small and is associated with other neurodevelopmental disorders. Optical
  coherence tomography (OCT) can be used to measure the retinal nerve fiber layer
  and can add quantification for measuring nerve size.
