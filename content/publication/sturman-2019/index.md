abstract: The present study was designed to establish whether a cue-based assessment
  of driving could predict cognitive load and performance during a simulated driving
  task. Following an assessment of cue utilization in the domain of driving, participants
  completed a moderate workload simulated driving task, during which cerebral oxygenation,
  eye behavior, and driving performance metrics were recorded. During the simulated
  driving task, participants with higher cue utilization recorded smaller increases
  in cerebral oxygenation in the prefrontal cortex relative to baseline, and smaller
  mean fixation dispersions, compared to participants with lower cue utilization.
  There were no statistically significant differences in the number of speed exceedances
  nor missed traffic signals based on cue utilization. These outcomes suggest that
  participants with higher cue utilization were able to allocate fewer cognitive resources
  to the simulated driving task, while maintaining an equivalent level of driving
  performance, compared to participants with lower cue utilization.
