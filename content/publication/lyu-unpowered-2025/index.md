abstract: Lower limb exoskeletons have been designed to assist human walking. However,
  current unpowered exoskeletons primarily targeted the ankle joint, but neglected
  the energy storage and recoil within the foot. In this study, we proposed an unpowered
  foot-ankle exoskeleton with a bionic multi-segment foot structure to mimic energy
  conservation strategies of natural barefoot walking. An arch-like structure was
  built in the exoskeleton with springs aligning with the medial longitudinal arch
  and the plantar fascia to store elastic energy in the early and mid-stance phases
  and recoil energy in the late stance phase of walking. We found that compared with
  mass-matched experimental shoes, the exoskeleton reduced the total net metabolic
  cost of walking by $8.5~pm ~3.1$ % for healthy individuals, and caused a 10.6% reduction
  in the average activity and a 25.9% reduction in the tissue oxygen saturation index
  of the soleus. As expected, the exoskeleton did not interfere with the natural motion
  of the midfoot and ankle joints during walking. The exoskeleton may help reduce
  energetic penalties by assisting the soleus concentric contraction for propulsion
  and permitting sufficient intra-foot motion. Our results highlight the importance
  of utilizing elastic energy storage of intra-foot structures for walking assistance,
  and imply that implementing a multi-foot structure have a potential to further improve
  the performance of walking assistance devices
