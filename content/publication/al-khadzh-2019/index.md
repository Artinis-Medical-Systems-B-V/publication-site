abstract: One of the important tendencies of current clinical audiology is objectivization
  of hearing assessment. The presence of sensory perception is determined by neuronal
  activation of a certain area of the cerebral cortex caused by appropriate stimuli.
  It describes the connection of all elements of a sensor system and the performance
  of its main function. Hearing assessment objectivization can be provided by monitoring
  or operating control of electrophysiological, hemodynamic and/or metabolic parameters
  of the auditory cortex. Among possible direct and indirect methods of the control
  of the induced cerebral activity such as electroencephalography, rheoencephalography,
  functional magnetic resonance tomography, and positron emission tomography, the
  spectrophotometric method is the most appropriate one for the purpose in view. In
  this research, an analysis of literature data and results of preliminary experimental
  studies are presented. The obtained results allow us to reveal the method limitations,
  to formulate medical and technical requirements for development of hardware and
  software of the diagnostic device for objectivization of auditory detection control,
  and confirm the efficiency of spectrophotometric method, well known as NIRS.
