 abstract = {One of the important tendencies of current clinical audiology is objectivization of hearing assessment. The presence of sensory perception is determined by neuronal activation of a certain area of the cerebral cortex caused by appropriate stimuli. It describes the connection of all elements of a sensor system and the performance of its main function. Hearing assessment objectivization can be provided by monitoring or operating control of electrophysiological, hemodynamic and/or metabolic parameters of the auditory cortex. Among possible direct and indirect methods of the control of the induced cerebral activity such as electroencephalography, rheoencephalography, functional magnetic resonance tomography, and positron emission tomography, the spectrophotometric method is the most appropriate one for the purpose in view. In this research, an analysis of literature data and results of preliminary experimental studies are presented. The obtained results allow us to reveal the method limitations, to formulate medical and technical requirements for development of hardware and software of the diagnostic device for objectivization of auditory detection control, and confirm the efficiency of spectrophotometric method, well known as NIRS.},
