abstract: "In some circumstances, cerebral blood volume (CBV) can be used as a measure\
  \ for cerebral blood flow. A new near infrared spectroscope was used for determining\
  \ the reproducibility of CBV measurements assessed by the O2-method. Twenty-seven\
  \ healthy subjects were investigated. An intrasubject coefficient of variation (CV)\
  \ was calculated, based on four identical episodes of desaturation-resaturation\
  \ (O2method) procedures for CBV measurements. Two trials were performed, with (trial\
  \ 1) and without (trial 2) disconnecting the equipment. A mean CV of 12.6% and 10.0%\
  \ was found in trial 1 and 2, respectively. Cerebral blood volume values yield 3.60\
  \ \xB1 0.82 mL 100 g-1. Cerebral blood volume could be measured reproducible in\
  \ adults using near infrared spectroscopy, if the arterial desaturation is limited\
  \ to approximately 5% from baseline level."
