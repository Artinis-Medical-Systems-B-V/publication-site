 abstract = {In some circumstances, cerebral blood volume (CBV) can be used as a measure for cerebral blood flow. A new near infrared spectroscope was used for determining the reproducibility of CBV measurements assessed by the O2-method. Twenty-seven healthy subjects were investigated. An intrasubject coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated, based on four identical episodes of desaturation-resaturation (O2method) procedures for CBV measurements. Two trials were performed, with (trial 1) and without (trial 2) disconnecting the equipment. A mean CV of 12.6% and 10.0% was found in trial 1 and 2, respectively. Cerebral blood volume values yield 3.60 Â± 0.82 mL 100 g-1. Cerebral blood volume could be measured reproducible in adults using near infrared spectroscopy, if the arterial desaturation is limited to approximately 5% from baseline level.},
