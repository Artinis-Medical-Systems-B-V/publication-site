abstract: In the realm of human factors, objective assessment of cognitive states
  is crucial for the safe completion of tasks. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy
  (fNIRS) can be employed to recognize the cognitive activities and evaluate the mental
  workload associated with cognitive-executive processes. This study proposes a method
  for facilitating the faster detection of changes in cognitive states based on the
  correlation coefficients of adjacent channels, which enables the extraction of local
  connectivity (LC) features from fNIRS data. The results indicate that the extracted
  new features can reflect changes in the activation patterns of specific brain regions
  during the early stages (0~2.5s) of the task. It is suggested that these features
  could be used to identify the brain's task states.
