 abstract = {Ageing is associated with endothelial dysfunction and reduced cerebral blood flow and oxygenation. The present study aimed to investigate whether turmeric supplementation could improve cerebral oxygenation and blood volume during brain activation via dynamic handgrip exercise in older males and females. Twelve older males and females were studied using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design. Participants ingested turmeric root extract or placebo. Heart rate and blood pressure were measured before and 2 hours after supplementation. Afterward, the exercise protocol was started, and cerebral oxygenation and blood volume were evaluated. During exercise, changes in cerebral oxygenation were higher after turmeric extract supplementation, as was blood volume compared to placebo. Changes in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure were not significant. The current findings indicate the potential for curcumin as an intervention for improving cerebral oxygenation and blood volume changes in older males and females.},
