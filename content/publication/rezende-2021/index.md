abstract: Ageing is associated with endothelial dysfunction and reduced cerebral blood
  flow and oxygenation. The present study aimed to investigate whether turmeric supplementation
  could improve cerebral oxygenation and blood volume during brain activation via
  dynamic handgrip exercise in older males and females. Twelve older males and females
  were studied using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design. Participants
  ingested turmeric root extract or placebo. Heart rate and blood pressure were measured
  before and 2 hours after supplementation. Afterward, the exercise protocol was started,
  and cerebral oxygenation and blood volume were evaluated. During exercise, changes
  in cerebral oxygenation were higher after turmeric extract supplementation, as was
  blood volume compared to placebo. Changes in heart rate, systolic blood pressure,
  and diastolic blood pressure were not significant. The current findings indicate
  the potential for curcumin as an intervention for improving cerebral oxygenation
  and blood volume changes in older males and females.
