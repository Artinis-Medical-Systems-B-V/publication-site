abstract: 'To further refine the near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-derived measure
  of skeletal muscle oxidative capacity in humans, we sought to determine whether
  the exercise stimulus intensity affected the τ value and/or influenced the magnitude
  of correlations with in vitro measures of mitochondrial content and in vivo indices
  of exercise performance. Males (n=12) and females (n=12), matched for maximal aerobic
  fitness per fat-free mass, completed NIRS-derived skeletal muscle oxidative capacity
  tests for the vastus lateralis following repeated contractions at 40% (τ 40 ) and
  100% (τ 100 ) of maximum voluntary contraction, underwent a skeletal muscle biopsy
  of the same muscle, and performed multiple intermittent isometric knee extension
  tests to task failure to establish critical torque (CT). τ 100 (34.4±7.0 s) was
  greater than τ 40 (24.2±6.9 s, ptextless0.001), but the values were correlated (r=0.688;
  ptextless0.001). τ 40 (r=-0.692, ptextless0.001) and τ 100 (r=-0.488, p=0.016) correlated
  with myosin heavy chain I percentage as well as several markers of mitochondrial
  content, including COX II protein content in whole muscle (τ 40 : r=-0.547, p=0.006;
  τ 100 : r=-0.466, p=0.022), type I pooled fibres (τ 40 : r=-0.547, p=0.006; τ 100
  : r=-0.547, p=0.006), and type II pooled fibres (τ 40 : r=-0.516, p=0.009; τ 100
  : r=-0.635, p=0.001). τ 40 (r=-0.702, ptextless0.001), but not τ 100 (r=-0.378,
  p=0.083) correlated with CT; however, neither value correlated with W'' (τ 40 :
  r=0.071, p=0.753; τ 100 : r=0.054, p=0.812). Overall, the NIRS method of assessing
  skeletal muscle oxidative capacity is sensitive to the intensity of skeletal muscle
  contraction but maintains relationships to whole-body fitness, isolated limb critical
  intensity, and mitochondrial content regardless of intensity.'
