abstract: "The purpose was to test the hypothesis that sex and fatigue effect of the\
  \ early phase of skeletal muscle tissue oxygenation (StO2, %) desaturation rate\
  \ as well as that strength matched adults may exhibit similar responses. Twenty-four\
  \ adults visited the laboratory twice to quantify this early phase of desaturation\
  \ during vascular occlusion tests (VOT) while in a rested state. The second visit\
  \ included a sustained handgrip task at 25% of maximal muscular strength until task\
  \ failure. At failure, a post-task VOT was initiated. Muscle desaturation was defined\
  \ as StO2 and collected by a near-infrared spectroscopy device. The muscle size\
  \ and adipose thickness were determined via ultrasonography. Linear regression was\
  \ used to quantify the rates of desaturation during the VOTs as well as during the\
  \ fatiguing handgrip. There were sex differences in the rate of desaturation pre-\
  \ and post-handgrip, such that independent of fatigue, the men (p < 0.001) desaturated\
  \ more rapidly than the women (pre: b = \u2212 0.208 vs. \u2212 0.123%\u2219s\u2212\
  1; post: \u2212 0.079 vs. \u2212 0.070%\u2219s\u22121). During the fatiguing handgrip,\
  \ the transformed StO2 values indicated that the males desaturated more rapidly\
  \ than the females (b = \u2212 0.070 vs. \u2212 0.015). The matched pairs exhibited\
  \ the same responses as the total sample. Overall, muscle size and strength as well\
  \ as adipose tissue were likely not the primary cause of the differences in rates\
  \ of muscle desaturation. We hypothesized that differences in fiber type and mitochondria\
  \ were the principle mechanisms provoking the differences in muscle oxygenation."
