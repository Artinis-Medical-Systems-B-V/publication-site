abstract: "Cryptorchidism is the most common male sexual disorder. In the case of\
  \ an abdominal testis there is no objective criterion to choose between autotransplantation\
  \ or orchiopexy after ligation of the spermatic vessels with. subsequent development\
  \ of collateral blood supply, By combining near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) with\
  \ pulse oximetry the active testicular blood volume (ATBV) before and after occlusion\
  \ of the spermatic vessels can be calculated in an animal model. NIRS is a noninvasive\
  \ continuous optical technique that measures tissue oxygenation and hemodynamics.\
  \ Ten boars with one nonpalpable testis each were selected. The spermatic vessels\
  \ and vas deferens were separately prepared and atraumatic occluders were placed\
  \ around the vessels. ATBV was measured before and after occlusion of the spermatic\
  \ vessels. The calculated ATBV was 18.3 \xB1 2.3 ml/100 g of testicular tissue,\
  \ not corrected by division by the path length factor, accounting for light scattering\
  \ in the tissue. In 5 of 10 boars no significant ATBV was found after occlusion\
  \ of the spermatic vessels, suggesting subsequent atrophy. NIRS combined with pulse\
  \ oximetry provides us with reproducible quantification of ATBV. The method can\
  \ be used to investigate the viability of a testis after (temporary) occlusion of\
  \ the spermatic vessels."
