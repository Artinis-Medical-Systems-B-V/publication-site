abstract: "This study investigated the influence of 180\xB0 changes of direction during\
  \ a repeated-sprint running test on performance, cardiorespiratory variables, muscle\
  \ deoxygenation and post-exercise blood lactate ([La] levels. Thirteen team-sport\
  \ athletes (22\xB13yr) performed 6 repeated maximal sprints with (RSS, 6\xD7[2\xD7\
  12.5m]) or without (RS, 6\xD725m) changes of direction. Best and mean running time,\
  \ percentage speed decrement (%Dec), pulmonary oxygen uptake (VO, vastus lateralis\
  \ deoxygenation (Hb and [La]were calculated for each condition. Best and mean times\
  \ for both protocols were largely correlated (r=0.63 and r=0.78, respectively),\
  \ and were almost certainly higher for RSS compared with RS (e.g., 5.30\xB10.17\
  \ vs. 4.09\xB10.17s for mean time, with the qualitative analysis revealing a 100%\
  \ chance of RSS time being greater than RS). In contrast, %Dec waspossibly lower\
  \ for RSS (2.6\xB11.2 vs. 3.2\xB11.3%, with a 79% chance of a real difference).\
  \ Compared with RS,VO(40.4\xB14.2 vs. 38.9\xB13.8mL.min 1.kg1, with a 90% chance\
  \ of a real difference) and [La](10.0\xB11.7 vs. 9.3\xB12.4mmol.L1, with a 70% chance\
  \ of a real difference) werepossibly higher. Conversely, there were no differences\
  \ in Hb(11.5\xB13.2 vs. 10.9\xB13.0M, with the comparison rated asunclear). To conclude,\
  \ the present results suggest that the ability to repeat sprints can be considered\
  \ as a general quality. They also suggest that repeated shuttle sprints might be\
  \ an effective training practice for eliciting a greater systemic physiological\
  \ load, but perhaps not a greater loading of the vastus lateralis. \xA9 Georg Thieme\
