abstract: Background Pilots must process multiple streams of information simultaneously.
  Mental workload is one of the main issues in manâ€“machine interactive mode when dealing
  with multiple tasks. This study aimed to combine functional near-infrared spectroscopy
  (fNIRS) and electrocardiogram (ECG) to detect changes in mental workload during
  multitasking in a simulated flight.  Methods Twenty-six participants performed three
  multitasking tasks at different mental workload levels. These mental workload levels
  were set by varying the number of subtasks. fNIRS and ECG signals were recorded
  during tasks. Participants filled in the national aeronautics and space administration
  task load index (NASA-TLX) scale after each task. The effects of mental workload
  on scores of NASA-TLX, performance of tasks, heart rate (HR), heart rate variability
  (HRV), and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation were analyzed.  Results Compared
  to multitasking in lower mental workload conditions, participants exhibited higher
  scores of NASA-TLX, HR, and PFC activation when multitasking in high mental workload
  conditions. Their performance was worse during the high mental workload multitasking
  condition, as evidenced by the higher average tracking distance, smaller number
  of response times, and longer response time of the meter. The standard deviation
  of the RR intervals (SDNN) was negatively correlated with subjective mental workload
  in the low task load condition and PFC activation was positively correlated with
  HR and subjective mental workload in the medium task load condition.  Conclusion
  HR and PFC activation can be used to detect changes in mental workload during simulated
  flight multitasking tasks.
