abstract: Firefighting is a hazardous task associated with a heavy workload where
  task duration may be limited by air cylinder capacity. Increased fitness may lead
  to better air ventilation efficiency and task duration at a given heavy work intensity.
  This study compared performance, air ventilation and skeletal muscle oxygen extraction
  during a maximal graded walking test (GWT), a 10METS (metabolic equivalent) treadmill
  test (T10) and a simulated work circuit (SWC). Participants (n=13) who performed
  the SWC in a shorter time had significantly lower air cylinder ventilation values
  on the T10 (r=-0.495), better peak oxygen consumption (r=-0.924) during the GWT
  and significantly greater skeletal muscle oxygen extraction during the SWC (HbDiff,
  r=0.768). These results demonstrate that the fastest participants on the SWC had
  better air ventilation efficiency that could prolong interventions in difficult
  situations requiring air cylinder use.
