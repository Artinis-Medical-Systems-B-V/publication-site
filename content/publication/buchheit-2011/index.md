abstract: "The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of an 8-week endurance\
  \ training program on repeated-sprint (RS) performance and post-sprints muscle reoxygenation\
  \ rate in 18 moderately trained males (34 \xB1 5 years). Maximal aerobic speed (MAS),\
  \ 10 km running and RS (2 \xD7 15-s shuttle-sprints, interspersed with 15 s of passive\
  \ recovery) performance were assessed before and after the training intervention.\
  \ Total distance covered (TD) and the percentage of distance decrement (%Dec) were\
  \ calculated for RS. Between-sprints muscle reoxygenation rate (Reoxy rate) was\
  \ assessed with near-infrared spectroscopy during RS before and after training.\
  \ After training, MAS (+9.8 \xB1 5.8%, with 100% chances to observe a substantial\
  \ improvement), 10 km time (-6.2 \xB1 5.3%, 99%), TD (+9.6 \xB1 7.7%, 98%), %Dec\
  \ (-25.6 \xB1 73.6%, 93%) and Reoxy rate (+152.4 \xB1 308.1%, 95%) were improved.\
  \ The improvement of Reoxy rate was largely correlated with improvements in MAS\
  \ [r = 0.63 (90% CL, 0.31;-0.82)] and %Dec [r = -0.52 (-0.15;-0.76)]. Present findings\
  \ confirm the beneficial effect of endurance training on post-sprint muscle reoxygenation\
  \ rate, which is likely to participate in the improvement of repeated-sprint ability\
  \ after training. These data also confirm the importance of aerobic conditioning\
  \ in sports, where repeating high-intensity/maximal efforts within a short time-period\
  \ are required. \xA9 2010 Springer-Verlag."
