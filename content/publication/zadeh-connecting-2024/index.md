abstract: People with Parkinson's disease often exhibit improvements in motor tasks
  when exposed to external sensory cues. While the effects of different types of sensory
  cues on motor functions in Parkinson's disease have been widely studied, the underlying
  neural mechanism of these effects and the potential of sensory cues to alter the
  motor cortical activity patterns and functional connectivity of cortical motor areas
  are still unclear. This study aims to compare changes in oxygenated haemoglobin,
  deoxygenated haemoglobin and correlations among different cortical regions of interest
  during wrist movement under different external stimulus conditions between people
  with Parkinson's disease and controls. Ten Parkinson's disease patients and 10 age‐
  and sex‐matched neurologically healthy individuals participated, performing repetitive
  wrist flexion and extension tasks under auditory and visual cues. Changes in oxygenated
  and deoxygenated haemoglobin in motor areas were measured using functional near‐infrared
  spectroscopy, along with electromyograms from wrist muscles and wrist movement kinematics.
  The functional near‐infrared spectroscopy data revealed significantly higher neural
  activity changes in the Parkinson's disease group's pre‐motor area compared to controls
  (p = 0.006), and functional connectivity between the supplementary motor area and
  pre‐motor area was also significantly higher in the Parkinson's disease group when
  external sensory cues were present (p = 0.016). These results indicate that external
  sensory cues' beneficial effects on motor tasks are linked to changes in the functional
  connectivity between motor areas responsible for planning and preparation of movements.
