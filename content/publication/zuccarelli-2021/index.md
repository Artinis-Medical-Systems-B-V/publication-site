abstract: "In order to identify peripheral biomarkers of impaired oxidative metabolism\
  \ during exercise following a 10-day bed rest, 10 males performed an incremental\
  \ exercise (to determine peak pulmonary V\u02D9O 2 (V\u02D9O 2 p)) and moderate-intensity\
  \ exercises, before (PRE) and after (POST) bed rest. Blood flow response was evaluated\
  \ in the common femoral artery by Eco-Doppler during 1 min of passive leg movements\
  \ (PLM). The intramuscular matching between O 2 delivery and Lucrezia Zuccarelli\
  \ completed her BSc and MSc in Sport Science at the University of Milan. During\
  \ her masters she was a visiting student at the European Space Agency in Cologne.\
  \ She moved to Udine and completed her PhD in Biomedical Sciences at the University\
  \ of Udine. Her research activity focuses on the functional evaluation of oxidative\
  \ metabolism during exercise along the oxygen pathway from the ambient air to skeletal\
  \ muscle mitochondria in physiological and non-physiological conditions. O 2 utilization\
  \ was evaluated by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Mitochondrial respiration\
  \ was evaluated ex vivo by high-resolution respirometry in isolated muscle fibres,\
  \ and in vivo by NIRS by the evaluation of skeletal muscle V\u02D9O 2 (V\u02D9O\
  \ 2 m) recovery kinetics. Resting V\u02D9O 2 m was estimated by NIRS. Peak V\u02D9\
  O 2 p was lower in POST vs. PRE. The area under the blood flow vs. time curve during\
  \ PLM was smaller (P = 0.03) in POST (274 \xB1 233 mL) vs. PRE (427 \xB1 291). An\
  \ increased (P = 0.03) overshoot of muscle deoxygenation during a metabolic transition\
  \ was identified in POST. Skeletal muscle citrate synthase activity was not different\
  \ (P = 0.11) in POST (131 \xB1 16 nmol min-1 mg-1) vs. PRE (138 \xB1 19). Maximal\
  \ ADP-stimulated mitochondrial respiration (66 \xB1 18 pmol s-1 mg-1 (POST) vs.\
  \ 72 \xB1 14 (PRE), P = 0.41) was not affected by bed rest. Apparent K m for ADP\
  \ sensitivity of mitochondrial respiration was reduced in POST vs. PRE (P = 0.04).\
  \ The V\u02D9O 2 m recovery time constant was not different (P = 0.79) in POST (22\
  \ \xB1 6 s) vs. PRE (22 \xB1 6). Resting V\u02D9O 2 m was reduced by 25% in POST\
  \ vs. PRE (P = 0.006). Microvascular-endothelial function was impaired following\
  \ a 10-day bed rest, whereas mitochondrial mass and function (both in vivo and ex\
  \ vivo) were unaffected or slightly enhanced. Abstract figure legend Potential sites\
  \ of impairment of oxidative metabolism during exercise following microgravity-inactivity.\
  \ Key points r Ten days of horizontal bed rest impaired in vivo oxidative function\
  \ during exercise. r Microvascular impairments were identified by different methods.\
  \ r Mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial function (evaluated both in vivo and ex\
  \ vivo) were unchanged or even improved (i.e. enhanced mitochondrial sensitivity\
  \ to submaximal [ADP]). r Resting muscle oxygen uptake was significantly lower following\
  \ bed rest, suggesting that muscle catabolic processes induced by bed rest/inactivity\
  \ are less energy-consuming than anabolic ones."
