abstract: With the growing concern for the health of ageing populations, much research
  continues to look at the impact of cognitive training, particularly in relation
  to cognitive decline. We sought to use novel techniques, including augmented reality
  and portable neurotechnology, to evaluate the impact of a dynamically adjusting
  cognitive training programme, in comparison to a statically challenging alternative.
  Before and after an 8-week training period, and at a 5-week follow-up, we used portable
  functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy to examine mental workload in a mixed battery
  of cognitive and transfer tasks. A recently developed tablet-based task was used
  to identify changes in cognitive misbinding. Augmented Reality was used to create
  a supermarket shopping experience, as a more ecologically valid and realistic transfer
  task relating to an everyday task relating to independence that quickly becomes
  difficult with cognitive decline. The analyses showed a decreased mental workload
  within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and that participants considerably increased
  their performance in the trained task. Some results were maintained at the 5-week
  follow-up assessment. In terms of transfer, we observed reliable group differences
  immediately after training completion, which were mainly driven by distinct conditions.
  Some behavioural memory gains were maintained during the follow-up. The use of novel
  technologies brought new insights into the effects produced by the dynamic computerised
  cognitive training programme, which has potential future applications in cognitive
  decline screening and prevention.
