abstract: Purpose This study aimed to investigate the effects of 4-week continuous
  hypoxic training (CHT) on skeletal muscle oxygenation and hemodynamics, assessed
  using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and blood oxygenation level-dependent
  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI-BOLD). Methods Twenty-six healthy male
  participants were randomly assigned to CHT group (FiO₂ = 14.8–15.3%) or a normoxic
  training (CON) group (FiO₂ = 20.3–20.8%). Participants underwent a 4-week supervised
  treadmill endurance training program at their ventilatory anaerobic threshold. Assessments
  included that muscle oxygen saturation (SmO₂) measurements using NIRS during graded
  exercise, and fMRI-BOLD imaging during ischemia–reperfusion to evaluate skeletal
  muscle perfusion and oxygenation in pre- and post-intervention. Results Significant
  increases were observed in SmO₂ at 20% (68.43 ± 5.90 vs 62.53 ± 6.70), 40% (64.50 ± 7.46
  vs 55.20 ± 7.43), 60% (54.42 ± 3.71 vs 45.63 ± 5.99), 80% (45.97 ± 5.91 vs 41.18 ± 6.40),
  and 100% (36.04 ± 6.62 vs 27.57 ± 5.66) exercise intensities (p textless 0.046)
  in CHT group as compared to CON group. Additionally, PHV (p textless 0.011), MIV
  (p textless 0.003), TTP (p = 0.024), THIM (p textless 0.045), and TTR (p textless 0.003)
  were significantly improved after 4-week CHT intervention as compared to normoxic
  training, suggesting enhanced vascular reactivity and oxygen utilization efficiency.
  Conclusion These findings demonstrate that CHT may enhance skeletal muscle oxygenation
  and perfusion, suggesting potential utility in endurance training and rehabilitation
  intervention by improving skeletal muscle oxygenation and perfusion, as evidenced
  by increased SmO₂ and enhanced BOLD responses, suggesting potential utility in endurance
  training and rehabilitation contexts. The application of fMRI-BOLD and NIRS provides
  novel insights into microvascular adaptations.
