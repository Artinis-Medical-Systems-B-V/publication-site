abstract: "Patients with muscular temporomandibular disorder (TMD) present with abnormal\
  \ oxygenation of the jaw muscles. Nonetheless, the deoxygenation pattern of jaw\
  \ muscles of healthy subjects with frequent wake-time tooth-clenching episodes,\
  \ who are at greater risk for TMD, has never been investigated. This case-control\
  \ study compared the deoxygenation of the masseter during standardized tasks between\
  \ TMD-free individuals with frequent self-reports of wake-time clenching and those\
  \ with infrequent self-reports. University students (N = 255) filled out the Oral\
  \ Behavior Checklist. Fourteen females with high versus low scores\u2014high parafunctional\
  \ (HP) group (n = 7, \u226580th percentile of score distribution) versus low parafunctional\
  \ (LP) group (n = 7, \u226420th percentile)\u2014completed 2 sessions during which\
  \ they clenched at their maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) for 2 min and at 10%\
  \ to 20% MVC for 20 min. Tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) and changes in oxygenated\
  \ hemoglobin, deoxygenated hemoglobin, and total hemoglobin of the masseter were\
  \ measured via near-infrared spectroscopy and analyzed with a generalized mixed\
  \ effect model. A significant interaction effect (task \xD7 study group) was found\
  \ on all outcome measures, indicating that the deoxygenation pattern of the HP group\
  \ differed from the LP group (all P < 0.001). MVC of the masseter induced an almost\
  \ 5-times-greater reduction of StO2 in the HP group as compared with the LP group\
  \ (P = 0.023). However, the relative increase in StO2 at rest after the MVC was\
  \ similar between groups (P > 0.05). At the end of the prolonged MVC task (10% to\
  \ 20%), the blood flow (change in total hemoglobin) was almost 6 times higher in\
  \ the LP group as compared with baseline. On the contrary, it increased minimally\
  \ in the HP group (all P < 0.001). Healthy individuals at risk for TMD have abnormalities\
  \ in masseter deoxygenation. Future prospective studies are needed to test whether\
  \ this contributes to the onset of muscular TMD."
