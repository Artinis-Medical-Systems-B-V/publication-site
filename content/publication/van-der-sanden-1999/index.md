abstract: "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of carbogen breathing\
  \ on the physiological profile of human glioma xenografts. Near infrared spectroscopy\
  \ was used to investigate changes in oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations in\
  \ tumor blood. Oxygen tension changes in tumor tissue were evaluated by 19F-MR relaxometry,\
  \ using perfluoro-15-crown-5-ether, and modifications of tumor blood perfusion (TBP)\
  \ were analyzed by fast dynamic 1H-MR imaging of Gd-DTPA uptake. Finally, changes\
  \ of the bioenergetic status and pH of tumor cells were analyzed by 31P-MRS. After\
  \ 5 to 8 min of carbogen breathing, the average oxygen tension increase in tumor\
  \ tissue was 4.6 \xB1 1.3 mm Hg, which is in agreement with an increase of the oxyhemoglobin\
  \ concentration in tumor blood ($\u0394$[O2Hb] = 9.2 \xB1 3 $\u03BC$M). However,\
  \ simultaneously the TBP was reduced, the bioenergetic status was diminished, and\
  \ pH was decreased. As 100% O2 breathing alone did not result in a detectable increase\
  \ of oxyhemoglobin in tumor blood, the increase of the tumor oxygenation by carbogen\
  \ appears to be mediated by its CO2 content. This component may cause a nutrient-limited\
  \ decrease of oxidative energy metabolism, indirectly via a steal-effect and/or\
  \ by inhibition of the glycolytic rate resulting from tissue acidification."
