abstract: "Hypoxic preconditioning prevents cerebrovascular/cardiovascular disorders\
  \ by increasing resistance to acute ischemic stress, but severe hypoxic exposure\
  \ disturbs vascular hemodynamics. This study compared how various exercise regimens\
  \ with/without hypoxia affect hemodynamics and oxygenation in cardiac, muscle, and\
  \ cerebral tissues during severe hypoxic exposure. Sixty sedentary males were randomly\
  \ divided into five groups. Each group (n = 12) received one of five interventions:\
  \ 1) normoxic (21% O2) resting control, 2) hypoxic (15% O2) resting control, 3)\
  \ normoxic exercise (50% maximum work rate under 21% O2; N-E group), 4) hypoxic-relative\
  \ exercise (50% maximal heart rate reserve under 15% O2; H-RE group), or 5) hypoxicabsolute\
  \ exercise (50% maximum work rate under 15% O2; H-AE group) for 30 min/day, 5 days/wk,\
  \ for 4 wk. A recently developed noninvasive bioreactance device was used to measure\
  \ cardiac hemodynamics, and near-infrared spectroscopy was used to assess perfusion\
  \ and oxygenation in the vastus lateralis (VL)/gastrocnemius (GN) muscles and frontal\
  \ cerebral lobe (FC). Our results demonstrated that the H-AE group had a larger\
  \ improvement in aerobic capacity compared with the N-E group. Both H-RE and H-AE\
  \ ameliorated the suppression of cardiac stroke volume and the GN hyperemic response\
  \ (Atotal Hb/min) and reoxygenation rate by acute 12% O2 exposure. Simultaneously,\
  \ the two hypoxic interventions enhanced perfusion (Atotal Hb) and O2 extraction\
  \ [AdeoxyHb] of the VL muscle during the 12% O 2 exercise. Although acute 12% O2\
  \ exercise decreased oxygenation ($\u0394$O2Hb) of the FC, none of the 4-wk interventions\
  \ influenced the cerebral perfusion, and oxygenation during normoxic/ hypoxic exercise\
  \ tests. Therefore, we conclude that moderate hypoxic exercise training improves\
  \ cardiopulmonary fitness and increases resistance to disturbance of cardiac hemodynamics\
  \ by severe hypoxia, concurrence with enhancing O2 delivery/utilization in skeletal\
  \ muscles but not cerebral tissues. Copyright \xA9 2010 the American Physiological\
