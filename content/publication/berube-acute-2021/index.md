abstract: Background Individuals with coronary heart disease (CHD) exhibit cognitive
  deficits and cerebrovascular dysfunctions, and are at higher risk of developing
  dementia. Cognitive function in individuals with CHD has never been studied during
  acute aerobic exercise. Given the increasing popularity of training at high peak
  power output (PPO), its impact on cerebrovascular and cognitive functions in individuals
  with CHD should be further studied. Method Thirty-eight individuals with CHD and
  16 healthy controls completed two exercise bouts at 30% and 70% of their individualized
  PPO on an ergocycle while performing a cognitive task including non-executive and
  executive conditions. Variations of oxy- deoxy-hemoglobin, and total hemoglobin
  concentrations were measured on left prefrontal cortex at both PPO using near-infrared
  spectroscopy. Results Cognitive task performances were equivalent between groups
  at all intensity levels. Individuals with CHD exhibited larger variation of deoxyhemoglobin
  in the executive condition and larger variation in total hemoglobin concentration
  in all task conditions compared to healthy controls at 70% of PPO. Conclusion Exercising
  at high intensity seems to have a larger impact on cerebral blood volume in CHD
  patients compared to healthy age-matched controls. Higher exercise intensity has
  negative impacts on cerebral blood volume variations during a cognitive task in
  CHD patients and could potentially lead to other neurocognitive dysfunctions. Other
  studies are needed to determine if a cognitive task administered during an exercise
  test could help identify individuals with CHD at higher risk of developing cognitive
  decline.
