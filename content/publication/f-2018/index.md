abstract: "Objective: We investigated the respiratory and vastus lateralis oxygenation\
  \ responses to exhaustive, constant-load cycling at two exercise intensities. Methods:\
  \ Eight moderately-trained male randomly cycled to exhaustion at 75% and 85% of\
  \ maximal work-load (CL75 and CL85, respectively) measured during a maximal incremental\
  \ test. From continuous recordings of respiratory variables and near-infrared spectroscopy\
  \ signals of the vastus lateralis muscle, VO2 slow component (SC) and deoxyhemoglobin\
  \ (HHb) SC were calculated. Results: At exhaustion, VO2 (+19 \xB1 25%), VO2 SC (+59\
  \ \xB1 24%) and minute ventilation (+14 \xB1 14%) were significantly higher during\
  \ CL85 vs. CL75, whereas oxyhemoglobin (-67 \xB1 22%) and total hemoglobin (-36\
  \ \xB1 3%) responses were lower (all p<0.05). Additionally, VO2 SC during CL75 and\
  \ CL85 were strongly correlated (r=0.88, p<0.001). The HHb SC did not differ between\
  \ CL75 and CL85 (3.10 \xB1 0.75 vs. 3.44 \xB1 1.1 A.U, respectively; p=0.60). HHb\
  \ SC and VO2 SC during CL85 (r=0.94, p<0.001), but not during CL75 (r=-0.08, p=0.90),\
  \ were correlated. Finally, HHb SC during CL75 and CL85 were unrelated (r=-0.20,\
  \ p=0.70). Conclusion: Our results highlight that only the contribution of locomotor\
  \ muscles to the VO2 SC magnitude is affected by the exercise intensity and not\
  \ that of ventilation."
