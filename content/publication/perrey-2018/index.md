abstract: 'Background: Since the introduction (in 2006) of commercially available
  portable wireless muscle oximeters, the use of muscle near-infrared spectroscopy
  (NIRS) technology is gaining in popularity as an application to observe changes
  in muscle metabolism and muscle oxygenation during and after exercise or training
  interventions in both laboratory and applied sports settings. Objectives: The objectives
  of this systematic review were to highlight the application of muscle oximetry in
  evaluating oxidative skeletal muscle performance to sport activities and emphasize
  how this technology has been applied to exercise and training. Methods: Preferred
  Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed
  in a systematic fashion to search, assess and synthesize existing literature on
  this topic. The Scopus and MEDLINE/PubMed electronic databases were searched to
  1 March 2017. Potential inclusions were screened against eligibility criteria relating
  to recreationally trained to elite athletes, with or without training programs,
  who must have assessed physiological variables monitored by commercial oximeters
  or NIRS instrumentation. Results: Of the 14,609 identified records, only 57 studies
  met the eligibility criteria. This systematic review highlighted a number of key
  findings in 16 sporting activities. Overall, NIRS information can be used as a marker
  of skeletal muscle oxidative capacity and for analyzing muscle performance factors.
  Conclusions: Although NIRS instrumentation is promising in evaluating oxidative
  skeletal muscle performance when used in sport settings, there is still the need
  for further instrumental development and randomized/longitudinal trials to support
  the detailed advantages of muscle oximetry utilization in sports science.'
