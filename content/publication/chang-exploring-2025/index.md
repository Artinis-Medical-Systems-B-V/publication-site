abstract: Mixed-reality (MR) technology has been widely used to simulate high-risk
  workplaces in order to minimize safety concerns. However, its use in understanding
  worker attentional allocation during interactions with drones in future construction
  environments remains underexplored. This study developed a futuristic bricklaying
  MR environment, where human-drone interaction was mandatory, to capture participants’
  naturalistic behaviors (i.e., attention, productivity, and distraction) across different
  interaction levels (i.e., no interaction, coexistence, and collaboration). The core
  research question explored whether workers maintained situational awareness of the
  drones or were distracted by them. The results confirmed that participants experienced
  a high sense of presence in the MR environment, driven by the use of environmental
  modalities, passive haptics, and drones’ sounds and spinning blades. Moreover, the
  findings demonstrated that participants were distracted by the drones during coexistence,
  as evidenced by lower productivity and reflections indicating they felt they were
  over-allocating attention to the drones. Conversely, participants exhibited situational
  awareness of the drones during collaboration, deliberately allocating attention
  to ensure safety, despite a reduction in productivity. These findings highlight
  the value of immersive technology in investigating workers’ naturalistic behaviors
  in future construction scenarios where workers and robots must function as teammates.
