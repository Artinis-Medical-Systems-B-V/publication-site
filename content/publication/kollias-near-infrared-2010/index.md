abstract: "Background: Continuous wave near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can monitor\
  \ chromophore change in the bladder detrusor muscle during voiding; oxygenation\
  \ and hemodynamic data derived differ in health and disease. Application of wireless\
  \ NIRS for evaluation of voiding dysfunction would benefit children. Methods: Subjects:\
  \ 20 children (4-17 yrs) [5 normal, 15 with urinary tract pathology]. Instrumentation:\
  \ self-contained device weight 84 gm; 3 paired light emitting diodes (760/850 nm)\
  \ in a spatially resolved configuration; source-detector separation distances (30,\
  \ 35 and 40 mm); silicon photodiode detector; and Bluetooth\xAE. Procedure: Transcutaneous\
  \ monitoring (midline abdominal skin 2 cm above pubis) during spontaneous voiding\
  \ (bladder contraction) of oxygenated (O2Hb), deoxygenated (HHb) and total hemoglobin\
  \ (tHb) and tissue oxygen saturation index (TSI %) at 10 Hz. Results: All 20 trials\
  \ produced clear graphic data with no movement effect evident. Comparison of patterns\
  \ of chromophore change between normal and symptomatic subjects revealed trend differences\
  \ in O2Hb and tHb. (Normal positive; Symptomatic negative, and TSI% fell in symptomatic\
  \ group). Conclusions: Wireless NIRS is technically feasible in ambulant children.\
  \ Negative trends in chromophore concentration and falls in TSI% suggest a hemodynamic\
  \ impairment may underlie some forms of voiding dysfunction, with abnormal physiology\
  \ involving the microcirculation possibly resulting in muscle fatigue during voiding.\
