Sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity and chronic intermittent nocturnal hypoxia in individuals with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) predispose them to microvascular impairment, which may contribute to increased daytime muscle fatigue. This study aimed to assess microvascular reactivity of the skeletal muscle, examine fatigability, and determine the relationship between fatigability and microvascular reactivity in adults with OSA.
Methods
Twenty-six participants were allocated into two groups—those with OSA and those without i.e. non-OSA. Each group comprised of 13 individuals who underwent an arterial occlusion test on their non-dominant leg. The percentage change of maximal hyperemic response (MHR) and the time to achieve MHR (tM) of both the total myoglobin/hemoglobin (∆[Hbtot]) and the oxygenated myoglobin/hemoglobin (∆[HbO2]) signals from near-infrared spectroscopy were calculated to examine microvascular reactivity. In addition, a 10-min walk test was performed to assess performance and perceived fatigability.
Results
The OSA group demonstrated a reduced in ∆[Hbtot]MHR (150.9 ± 16.2% vs. 235.8 ± 72.7%, p = 0.006), ∆[HbO2]MHR (131.4 ± 8% vs. 161.7 ± 10.6%, p = 0.001) and increased ∆[Hbtot]tM (80.5 ± 13.1 s vs. 47.7 ± 9.9 s, p \textless 0.001), ∆[HbO2]tM (85.2 ± 22.4 s vs. 52.1 ± 5.9 s, p = 0.001) compared to the non-OSA group. In addition, participants in the OSA group experienced greater perceived (6 ± 1 vs. 2.8 ± 0.1, p = 0.001) and performance fatigability (1.1 ± 0.1 vs. 0.9 ± 0.1, p = 0.001) compared to adults in the non-OSA group. Moreover, both performance and perceived fatigability were significantly associated with microvascular reactivity parameters (all p \textless 0.05).
Conclusion
Microvascular dysfunction, as determined by an attenuated post-occlusive reactive hyperemia, is observed in individuals with OSA that may contribute to increased fatigability in these individuals.},
