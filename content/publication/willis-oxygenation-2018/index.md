abstract: "The aim was to evaluate changes in peripheral and cerebral oxygenation,\
  \ cardiorespiratory, and performance differences, as well as neuromuscular fatigue\
  \ across multiple levels of blood flow restriction (BFR) during a repeated cycling\
  \ sprint test to exhaustion (RST). Participants performed three RST (10-sec maximal\
  \ sprints with 20-sec recovery until exhaustion) with measurements of power output\
  \ and V\u0307O2peak as well as oxygenation (near-infrared spectroscopy) of the vastus\
  \ lateralis and prefrontal cortex. Neuromuscular fatigue was assessed by femoral\
  \ nerve stimulation to evoke the vastus lateralis. Tests were conducted with proximal\
  \ lower limb bilateral vascular occlusion at 0%, 45%, and 60% of resting pulse elimination\
  \ pressure. Total work decreased with BFR (52.5\_\xB1\_22.9% at 45%, 68.6\_\xB1\_\
  32.6% at 60%, P\_<\_0.01 compared with 0%) as V\u0307O2peak (12.6\_\xB1\_9.3% at\
  \ 45%, 18.2\_\xB1\_7.2% at 60%, compared with 0%, P\_<\_0.01). Decreased changes\
  \ in muscle deoxyhemoglobin (\u2206[HHb]) during sprints were demonstrated at 60%\
  \ compared to 0% (P\_<\_0.001). Changes in total hemoglobin concentrations (\u2206\
  [tHb]) increased at both 45% and 60% compared with 0% (P\_<\_0.001). Cerebral \u2206\
  [tHb] increased toward exhaustion (P\_<\_0.05). Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC),\
  \ voluntary activation level (VAL), and root mean square (RMS)/M-wave ratio decreased\
  \ at 60% compared with 0% (P\_<\_0.001, all). MVC and VAL decreased between 45%\
  \ and 60% (P\_<\_0.05, both). The application of BFR during RST induced greater\
  \ changes in tissue perfusion (via blood volume, \u2206[tHb]) suggesting a possible\
  \ stimulus for vascular blood flow regulation. Additionally, high-intensity sprint\
  \ exercise with partial ischemia may challenge cerebral blood flow regulation and\
  \ influence local fatigue development due to protection of cerebral function."
