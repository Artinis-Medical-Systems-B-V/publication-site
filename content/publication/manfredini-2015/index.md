abstract: "Background: Skeletal muscle dysfunction and poor exercise tolerance are\
  \ hallmarks of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Noninvasively measured (near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy, NIRS) resting muscle oxygen consumption (rmVO2) is a biomarker of\
  \ muscle dysfunction, which can be applied to study the severity and the reversibility\
  \ of ESRD myopathy. We tested the hypothesis that deconditioning is a relevant factor\
  \ in ESRD myopathy. Methods: The whole dialysis population (n = 59) of two of the\
  \ eight centers participating into the EXCITE study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01255969),\
  \ a randomized trial evaluating the effect of a home-based exercise program on the\
  \ functional capacity of these patients was studied. Thirty-one patients were in\
  \ the active arm (exercise group) and 28 in the control arm (no intervention). Normative\
  \ data for rmVO2 were obtained from a group of 19 healthy subjects. Results: rmVO2\
  \ was twice higher (p < 0.001) in ESRDs patients (0.083 \xB1 0.034 ml/100 g/min)\
  \ than in healthy subjects (0.041 \xB1 0.020 ml/100 g/min) indicating substantial\
  \ skeletal muscle dysfunction in ESRD. rmVO2 correlated with resting heart rate\
  \ (r = 0.34, p = 0.009) but was independent of age, dialysis vintage, biochemical,\
  \ vascular and nutrition parameters. After the 6-month exercise program, rmVO2 reduced\
  \ to 0.064 \xB1 0.024 ml/100 g/min (-23%, p < 0.001) in the exercise group indicating\
  \ that skeletal muscle dysfunction is largely reversible but remained identical\
  \ in the control group (0.082 \xB1 0.032 to 0.082 \xB1 0.031 ml/100 g/min). Conclusion:\
  \ Deconditioning has a major role in ESRD myopathy. rmVO2 is a marker of physical\
  \ deconditioning and has the potential for monitoring re-conditioning programs based\
  \ on physical exercise in the ESRD population."
