abstract: "We investigated whether leg and arm skeletal muscle, and cerebral deoxygenation,\
  \ differ during incremental cycling exercise in men and women, and if women's lower\
  \ capacity to deliver O2 affects tissue deoxygenation. Men (n=10) compared to women\
  \ (n=10), had greater cardiac output, which with greater hemoglobin concentration\
  \ produced greater absolute (QaO2) and body size-adjusted oxygen delivery (QaO2i)\
  \ at peak exercise. Despite women's lower peak QaO2, their leg muscle deoxygenation\
  \ was similar at a given work rate and QaO2, but less than in men at peak exercise\
  \ ($\u03B4$tissue saturation index -27.1\xB113.2% vs. -11.8\xB15.7%, P<0.01; $\u03B4\
  $[deoxyhemoglobin] 15.03\xB18.57$\u03BC$M vs. 3.73\xB13.98$\u03BC$M, P<0.001). At\
  \ peak exercise, oxygen uptake was associated both with QaO2 and leg muscle deoxygenation\
  \ (both P<0.01). Arm muscle and cerebral deoxygenation did not differ between sexes\
  \ at peak exercise. Thus, both high O2 delivery and severe active muscle deoxygenation\
  \ are determinants of good exercise performance, and active muscle deoxygenation\
  \ responses are regulated partly in a sex-specific manner with an influence of exercise\
  \ capacity. \xA9 2013 Elsevier B.V."
