abstract: "New Findings: What is the central question of this study? What is the effect\
  \ of acute NO precursor intake on vascular function, muscle and cerebral oxygenation\
  \ and peripheral and central neuromuscular fatigue during knee-extension exercise?\
  \ What is the main finding and its importance? Acute NO precursor ingestion increases\
  \ the plasma concentrations of NO precursors (nitrate, arginine and citrulline)\
  \ and enhances post-ischaemic vasodilatation, but has no significant effect on muscle\
  \ and cerebral oxygenation, peripheral and central mechanisms of neuromuscular fatigue\
  \ and, consequently, does not improve exercise performance. Abstract: Nitric oxide\
  \ (NO) plays an important role in matching blood flow to oxygen demand in the brain\
  \ and contracting muscles during exercise. Previous studies have shown that increasing\
  \ NO bioavailability can improve muscle function. The aim of this study was to assess\
  \ the effect of acute NO precursor intake on muscle and cerebral oxygenation and\
  \ on peripheral and central neuromuscular fatigue during exercise. In four experimental\
  \ sessions, 15 healthy men performed a thigh ischaemia\u2013reperfusion test followed\
  \ by submaximal isometric knee extensions (5\_s on\u20134\_s off; 45% of maximal\
  \ voluntary contraction) until task failure. In each session, subjects drank a nitrate-rich\
  \ beetroot juice containing 520\_mg nitrate (N), N and citrulline (6\_g; N+C), N\
  \ and arginine (6\_g; N+A) or a placebo (PLA). Prefrontal cortex and quadriceps\
  \ near-infrared spectroscopy parameters were monitored continuously. Transcranial\
  \ magnetic stimulation and femoral nerve electrical stimulation were used to assess\
  \ central and peripheral determinants of fatigue. The post-ischaemic increase in\
  \ thigh blood total haemoglobin concentration was larger in N (10.1\_\xB1\_3.7\_\
  mmol) and N+C (10.9\_\xB1\_3.3\_mmol) compared with PLA (8.2\_\xB1\_2.7\_mmol; P\_\
  <\_0.05). Nitric oxide precursors had no significant effect on muscle and cerebral\
  \ oxygenation or on peripheral and central mechanisms of neuromuscular fatigue during\
  \ exercise. The total number of knee extensions did not differ between sessions\
  \ (N, 71.9\_\xB1\_33.2; N+A, 73.3\_\xB1\_39.4; N+C, 74.6\_\xB1\_34.0; PLA, 71.8\_\
  \xB1\_39.9; P\_>\_0.05). In contrast to the post-ischaemic hyperaemic response,\
  \ NO bioavailability in healthy subjects might not be the limiting factor for tissue\
  \ perfusion and oxygenation during submaximal knee extensions to task failure."
