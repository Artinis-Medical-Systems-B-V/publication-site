abstract: "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the primary cues regulating\
  \ perceived effort and exercise performance using a fixed-RPE protocol in severe\
  \ and moderate hypoxia. Methods: Eight male participants (26 \xB1 6 years, 76.3\
  \ \xB1 8.6\_kg, 178.5 \xB1 3.6\_cm, 51.4 \xB1 8.0 mL\_kg \u2212 1 \_min \u2212 1\
  \ V\u02D9 O 2max ) completed three exercise trials in environmental conditions of\
  \ severe hypoxia (F I O 2 0.114), moderate hypoxia (F I O 2 0.152), and normoxia\
  \ (F I O 2 0.202). They were instructed to continually adjust their power output\
  \ to maintain a perceived effort (RPE) of 16, exercising until power output declined\
  \ to 80% of the peak 30-s power output achieved. Results: Exercise time was reduced\
  \ (severe hypoxia 428 \xB1 210\_s; moderate hypoxia 1044 \xB1 384\_s; normoxia 1550\
  \ \xB1 590\_s) according to a reduction in F I O 2 (P < 0.05). The rate of oxygen\
  \ desaturation during the first 3 min of exercise was accelerated in severe hypoxia\
  \ (\u2212 5.3 \xB1 2.8%\_min \u2212 1 ) relative to moderate hypoxia (\u2212 2.5\
  \ \xB1 1.0%\_min \u2212 1 ) and normoxia (\u2212 0.7 \xB1 0.3%\_min \u2212 1 ).\
  \ Muscle tissue oxygenation did not differ between conditions (P > 0.05). Minute\
  \ ventilation increased at a faster rate according to a decrease in F I O 2 (severe\
  \ hypoxia 27.6 \xB1 6.6; moderate hypoxia 21.8 \xB1 3.9; normoxia 17.3 \xB1 3.9\
  \ L\_min \u2212 1 ). Moderate-to-strong correlations were identified between breathing\
  \ frequency (r = \u2212 0.718, P < 0.001), blood oxygen saturation (r = 0.611, P\
  \ = 0.002), and exercise performance. Conclusions: The primary cues for determining\
  \ perceived effort relate to progressive arterial hypoxemia and increases in ventilation."
