abstract: "PURPOSE: It has been suggested that, because of the low sitting position\
  \ in short-track speed skating, muscle blood flow is restricted, leading to decreases\
  \ in tissue oxygenation. Therefore, wearable wireless-enabled near-infrared spectroscopy\
  \ (NIRS) technology was used to monitor changes in quadriceps muscle blood volume\
  \ and oxygenation during a 500-m race simulation in short-track speed skaters. METHODS:\
  \ Six elite skaters, all of Olympic standard (age = 23 \xB1 1.8 yr, height = 1.8\
  \ \xB1 0.1 m, mass = 80.1 \xB1 5.7 kg, midthigh skinfold thickness = 7 \xB1 2 mm),\
  \ were studied. Subjects completed a 500-m race simulation time trial (TT). Whole-body\
  \ oxygen consumption was simultaneously measured with muscle oxygenation in right\
  \ and left vastus lateralis as measured by NIRS. RESULTS: Mean time for race completion\
  \ was 44.8 \xB1 0.4 s. V\u0307O 2 peaked 20 s into the race. In contrast, muscle\
  \ tissue oxygen saturation (TSI%) decreased and plateaued after 8 s. Linear regression\
  \ analysis showed that right leg TSI% remained constant throughout the rest of the\
  \ TT (slope value = 0.01), whereas left leg TSI% increased steadily (slope value\
  \ = 0.16), leading to a significant asymmetry (P < 0.05) in the final lap. Total\
  \ muscle blood volume decreased equally in both legs at the start of the simulation.\
  \ However, during subsequent laps, there was a strong asymmetry during cornering;\
  \ when skaters traveled solely on the right leg, there was a decrease in its muscle\
  \ blood volume, whereas an increase was seen in the left leg. CONCLUSIONS: NIRS\
  \ was shown to be a viable tool for wireless monitoring of muscle oxygenation. The\
  \ asymmetry in muscle desaturation observed on the two legs in short-track speed\
  \ skating has implications for training and performance. \xA9 2012 by the American\
