abstract: "People suffering from neuromuscular disorders such as locked-in syndrome\
  \ (LIS) are left in a paralyzed state with preserved awareness and cognition. In\
  \ this study, it was hypothesized that changes in local hemodynamic activity, due\
  \ to the activation of Broca's area during overt/covert speech, can be harnessed\
  \ to create an intuitive Brain Computer Interface based on Near-Infrared Spectroscopy\
  \ (NIRS). A 12-channel square template was used to cover inferior frontal gyrus\
  \ and changes in hemoglobin concentration corresponding to six aloud (overtly) and\
  \ six silently (covertly) spoken words were collected from eight healthy participants.\
  \ An unsupervised feature extraction algorithm was implemented with an optimized\
  \ support vector machine for classification. For all participants, when considering\
  \ overt and covert classes regardless of words, classification accuracy of 92.88\
  \ \xB1 18.49% was achieved with oxy-hemoglobin (O2Hb) and 95.14 \xB1 5.39% with\
  \ deoxy-hemoglobin (HHb) as a chromophore. For a six-active-class problem of overtly\
  \ spoken words, 88.19 \xB1 7.12% accuracy was achieved for O2Hb and 78.82 \xB1 15.76%\
  \ for HHb. Similarly, for a six-active-class classification of covertly spoken words,\
  \ 79.17 \xB1 14.30% accuracy was achieved with O2Hb and 86.81 \xB1 9.90% with HHb\
  \ as an absorber. These results indicate that a control paradigm based on covert\
  \ speech can be reliably implemented into future Brain\u2013Computer Interfaces\
  \ (BCIs) based on NIRS."
