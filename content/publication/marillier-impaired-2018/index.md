abstract: "Objective and background: Impaired cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular\
  \ reactivity to hypercapnia during wakefulness at rest as well as reduced exercise\
  \ tolerance have been reported in severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients.\
  \ Impaired cerebral oxygenation and hemodynamics can contribute to reduced exercise\
  \ performance. We hypothesized that (i) OSA patients show impaired cerebrovascular\
  \ response both during exercise and in response to hypercapnia together with reduced\
  \ exercise tolerance and (ii) continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment\
  \ improves these alterations in cerebral oxygenation. Methods: Fifteen OSA patients\
  \ and 12 healthy matched controls performed a hypercapnic response test and a maximal\
  \ cardiopulmonary exercise test before and after eight weeks of CPAP treatment or\
  \ control period. Prefrontal cortex and muscle oxygenation were assessed by near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy (NIRS) during both tests. Results: Cerebrovascular reactivity to\
  \ hypercapnia was impaired in OSA patients (lower increase in oxyhemoglobin [0.29\
  \ \xB1 0.19 vs 0.44 \xB1 0.14 $\u03BC$mol mmHg\u22121] and total hemoglobin [0.14\
  \ \xB1 0.15 vs 0.26 \xB1 0.09 $\u03BC$mol mmHg\u22121]) compared to controls. Reduced\
  \ prefrontal cortex oxygen extraction and total blood volume (ie, lower increase\
  \ in deoxyhemoglobin [1.76 \xB1 1.57 vs 3.43 \xB1 2.08 $\u03BC$mol] and total hemoglobin\
  \ [5.36 \xB1 7.08 vs 8.55 \xB1 5.13 $\u03BC$mol at exhaustion], respectively) during\
  \ exercise together with a reduced exercise tolerance (ie, lower peak oxygen consumption)\
  \ were observed in OSA patients compared to controls. CPAP treatment did not induce\
  \ any improvement in cerebrovascular response during hypercapnic response test and\
  \ exercise. Conlusions: This study demonstrates that cerebrovascular response to\
  \ exercise is altered in OSA and may contribute to exercise intolerance in these\
  \ patients. Prefrontal cortex oxygenation and exercise tolerance are not significantly\
  \ improved following eight weeks of CPAP treatment. Clinical trial registration:\
  \ NCT02854280."
