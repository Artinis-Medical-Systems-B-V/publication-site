abstract: This study investigates concurrent changes in cognitive workload and situation
  awareness during the use of full driving automation. Research shows that automation
  use has a negative effect on situation awareness. Driving studies posit a decline
  in cognitive workload when driving automation is engaged. Yet little is known about
  how changes in cognitive workload affects situation awareness, or vice versa, when
  full driving automation is used. Participants were instructed to operate a virtual
  reality fixed-base driving simulator in full driving automation mode. No driving
  input was required by participants making the driving demand minimal. Situation
  awareness was measured by means of the situation awareness global assessment scale.
  Cognitive workload was measured by means of behavioral, ocular, and neurophysiological
  metrics. Lower awareness was observed over time. Cognitive workload increased over
  time as evidenced by an increase in pupil size and oxygenated hemoglobin in the
  right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Results indicate an inverse relationship between
  cognitive workload and situation awareness, with increments in the former leading
  to reductions in the latter. Although this pattern runs counter to our hypothesis,
  this is consistent with prior work observing a decline in situation awareness under
  increasingly higher workload.
