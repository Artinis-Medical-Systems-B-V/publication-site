abstract: 'Background One of the most common causes of exercise-induced pain in the
  lower leg is chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS). Research is limited
  on muscle strength, oxygen saturation and physical activity in patients with CECS.   Purpose
  To compare muscle strength, oxygen saturation, and daily physical activity between
  patients with CECS and matched asymptomatic controls. A secondary purpose was to
  investigate the association between oxygen saturation and lower leg pain in patients
  with CECS.   Study Design Case-control study.   Method  Maximal isometric muscle
  strength of the ankle plantar and dorsiflexors was tested in patients with CECS
  and sex- and age-matched controls using an isokinetic dynamometer and oxygen saturation
  (StO 2 ) during running was tested by near infrared spectroscopy. Perceived pain
  and exertion were measured during the test using the Numeric Rating Scale and Borg
  Rating of Perceived Exertion scale and the exercise-induced leg pain questionnaire.
  Physical activity was assessed by accelerometry.    Results  Twenty-four patients
  with CECS and 24 controls were included. There were no differences in maximal isometric
  plantar or dorsiflexion muscle strength between patients and controls. Baseline
  StO 2 was 4.5pp (95% CI: 0.7;8.3) lower for patients with CECS than for controls,
  whereas no difference existed when they experienced pain or reached exhaustion.
  No differences were found in daily physical activities, except that on average,
  patients with CECS spent less time cycling daily. During the StO 2 measurement,
  patients experienced pain or reached exhaustion while running significantly earlier
  than the controls (ptextless0.001). StO 2 was not associated with leg pain.    Conclusion
  Patients with CECS have similar leg muscle strength, oxygen saturation and physical
  activity levels as asymptomatic controls. However, patients with CECS experienced
  significantly higher levels of lower leg pain than the controls during running,
  daily activities and at rest. Oxygen saturation and lower leg pain were not associated.   Level
  of Evidence Level 3b.'
