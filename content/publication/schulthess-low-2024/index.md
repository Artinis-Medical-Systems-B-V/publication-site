abstract: Spectrum power analysis in the low frequency oscillations (LFO) region of
  functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a promising method to deliver information
  about brain activation and therefore might be used for prognostication in patients
  with disorders of consciousness in the neurocritical care unit alongside with established
  methods. In this study, we measure the cortical hemodynamic response measured by
  fNIRS in the LFO region following auditory and somatosensory stimulation in healthy
  subjects. The significant hemodynamic reaction in the contralateral hemisphere correlation
  with the physiologic electric response suggests neurovascular coupling. In addition,
  we investigate power spectrum changes in steady state measurements of cerebral death
  patients and healthy subjects in the LFO region, the frequency of the heartbeat
  and respiration. The spectral power within the LFO region was lower in the patients
  with cerebral death compared to the healthy subjects, whereas there were no differences
  in spectral power for physiological activities such as heartbeat and respiration
  rate. This finding indicates the cerebral origin of our low frequency measurements.
  Therefore, LFO measurements are a potential method to detect brain activation in
  patients with disorders of consciousness and cerebral death. However, further studies
  in patients are needed to investigate its potential clinical use.
