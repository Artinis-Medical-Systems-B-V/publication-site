abstract: "Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive method to monitor cerebral\
  \ haemodynamics. Used either alone or in combination with other non-invasive methods\
  \ such as transcranial Doppler sonography, this technique is well suited for use\
  \ in cerebrovascular research in ageing. Reproducibility of NIRS, however, has only\
  \ been determined in neonates and adults. We applied controlled desaturation (the\
  \ O2-method) to measure the cerebral blood volume (CBV) with NIRS in 16 healthy\
  \ subjects aged 65 to 88. This method uses deoxygenated haemoglobin (the concentration\
  \ of which is manipulated by desaturation) as an intravascular tracer for NIRS.\
  \ We determined repeatability (between tests interval: 2 min), short-term reproducibility\
  \ (intervals of 20 and 40 min) and long-term reproducibility (interval > 2 weeks).\
  \ We found a coefficient of variation (CV) of 12.5% for repeatability and a CV of\
  \ 11.7% for short-term reproducibility. The CV for long-term reproducibility was\
  \ 15%. We conclude that NIRS can reproducibly measure CBV in subjects aged 65 and\
  \ older, using the O2-method. In this group of healthy subjects, this method was\
  \ well tolerated. \xA9 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd."
