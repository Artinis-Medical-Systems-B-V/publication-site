abstract: The digital age has accelerated collaborative innovation among interdisciplinary
  groups, and the collaborative behavior between individuals from different disciplinary
  backgrounds has gradually become normalized.Previous studies have suggested that
  interdisciplinary collaboration has certain advantages , there are currently few
  studies that empirically demonstrate this point through cognitive observations during
  collaborative processes.we used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to
  measure the brain Blood oxygen data(HbO2&Hb) of two individuals from both design
  and non-design majors during real-world presented problems (RPP) and RPP adapted
  (DES). The inter-brain synchronization (IBS) between the two participants was calculated
  by Matlab wavelet coherence package. It was found that the signal consistency generated
  on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in participants showed significant
  fluctuations in the RPP, but not in the DES. The results showed that the IBS of
  DLPFC increased under the RPP, which further supported previous research and also
  expanded the possibility of team collaboration task paradigms. The increase in IBS
  also considered of good cooperation, and this study can provide empirical evidence
  based on neuroimaging for interdisciplinary team collaboration.
