 abstract = {The digital age has accelerated collaborative innovation among interdisciplinary groups, and the collaborative behavior between individuals from different disciplinary backgrounds has gradually become normalized.Previous studies have suggested that interdisciplinary collaboration has certain advantages , there are currently few studies that empirically demonstrate this point through cognitive observations during collaborative processes.we used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure the brain Blood oxygen data(HbO2&Hb) of two individuals from both design and non-design majors during real-world presented problems (RPP) and RPP adapted (DES). The inter-brain synchronization (IBS) between the two participants was calculated by Matlab wavelet coherence package. It was found that the signal consistency generated on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in participants showed significant fluctuations in the RPP, but not in the DES. The results showed that the IBS of DLPFC increased under the RPP, which further supported previous research and also expanded the possibility of team collaboration task paradigms. The increase in IBS also considered of good cooperation, and this study can provide empirical evidence based on neuroimaging for interdisciplinary team collaboration.},
