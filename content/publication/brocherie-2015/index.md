abstract: "Purpose: This study aimed to determine the neuro-mechanical and metabolic\
  \ adjustments in the lower limbs induced by the running anaerobic sprint test (the\
  \ so-called RAST). Methods: Eight professional football players performed 6\_\xD7\
  \_35\_m sprints interspersed with 10\_s of active recovery on artificial turf with\
  \ their football shoes. Sprinting mechanics (plantar pressure insoles), root mean\
  \ square activity of the vastus lateralis (VL), rectus femoris (RF), and biceps\
  \ femoris (BF) muscles (surface electromyography, EMG) and VL muscle oxygenation\
  \ (near-infrared spectroscopy) were monitored continuously. Results: Sprint time,\
  \ contact time and total stride duration increased from the first to the last repetition\
  \ (+17.4, +20.0 and +16.6\_%; all P\_<\_0.05), while flight time and stride length\
  \ remained constant. Stride frequency (\u221213.9\_%; P\_<\_0.001) and vertical\
  \ stiffness decreased (\u221227.2\_%; P\_<\_0.001) across trials. Root mean square\
  \ EMG activities of RF and BF (\u221218.7 and \u221218.1\_%; P\_<\_0.01 and 0.001,\
  \ respectively), but not VL (\u22121.2\_%; P\_>\_0.05), decreased over sprint repetitions\
  \ and were correlated with the increase in running time (r\_=\_\u22120.82 and \u2212\
  0.90; both P\_<\_0.05). Together with a better maintenance of RF and BF muscles\
  \ activation levels over sprint repetitions, players with a better repeated-sprint\
  \ performance (lower cumulated times) also displayed faster muscle de- (during sprints)\
  \ and re-oxygenation (during recovery) rates (r\_=\_\u22120.74 and \u22120.84; P\_\
  <\_0.05 and 0.01, respectively). Conclusion: The repeated anaerobic sprint test\
  \ leads to substantial alterations in stride mechanics and leg-spring behaviour.\
  \ Our results also strengthen the link between repeated-sprint ability and the change\
  \ in neuromuscular activation as well as in muscle de- and re-oxygenation rates."
