abstract: 'Aims: The present study aims to examine: (1) the relationship between young
  children''s bilingualism and their performance in the Dimensional Card Change Sort
  (DCCS) task; and (2) whether prefrontal activation was associated with children''s
  bilingualism and executive function. Methodology: Children performed three sessions
  of the DCCS and their brain activity during the task was measured using functional
  nearinfrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Data and analysis: A sample of bilingual children
  (N = 49) was recruited from a preschool with an English immersion program. We examined
  whether children''s performance in the DCCS was related to their bilingualism and
  whether the changes in oxygenated hemoglobin in the prefrontal regions were related
  to their bilingualism and performance in the DCCS. Findings/conclusions: Results
  showed that children''s English ability was significantly correlated with their
  behavioral performance in DCCS, and predicted children''s group membership (pass
  or perseverate). Furthermore, children in the pass group significantly activated
  the prefrontal cortex than those in the perseverate group, and activation in the
  prefrontal region was significantly correlated with children''s English ability.
  Originality: The current study first examined the effect of children''s bilingualism
  on their executive function and prefrontal activation.'
