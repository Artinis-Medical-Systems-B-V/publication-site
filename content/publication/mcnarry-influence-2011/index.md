abstract: "It has been suggested that the potential for training to alter the physiological\
  \ responses to exercise in children is related to a \"maturational threshold\".\
  \ To address this, we investigated the interaction of swimtraining status and maturity\
  \ on cardiovascular and metabolic responses to lower and upper body exercise. Twenty-one\
  \ prepubertal [Pre: 11 trained (T), 10 untrained (UT)], 30 pubertal (Pub: 14 T,\
  \ 16 UT), and 18 postpubertal (Post: 8 T, 10 UT) girls completed ramp incremental\
  \ exercise on a cycle and an upper body ergometer. In addition to pulmonary gas\
  \ exchange measurements, stroke volume and cardiac output were estimated by thoracic\
  \ bioelectrical impedance, and muscle oxygenation status was assessed using near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy. All T girls had a higher peak O2 uptake during cycle (Pre: T 49\
  \ \xB1 5 vs. UT 40 \xB1 4; Pub: T 46 \xB1 5 vs. UT 36 \xB1 4; Post: T 48 \xB1 5\
  \ vs. UT 39 \xB1 8 ml\u02D9kg-1\u02D9min-1; all P < 0.05) and upper body exercise\
  \ (Pre: T 37 \xB1 6 vs. UT 32 \xB1 5; Pub: T 36 \xB1 5 vs. UT 28 \xB1 5; Post: T\
  \ 39 \xB1 3 vs. UT 28 \xB1 7ml\u02D9kg-1\u02D9min-1; allP < 0.05). T girls also\
  \ had a higher peak cardiac output during both modalities, and this reached significance\
  \ in Pub (cycle: T 21 \xB1 3 vs. UT 18 \xB1 3; upper body: T 20 \xB1 4 vs. UT 15\
  \ \xB1 4 l/min; all P < 0.05) and Post girls (cycle: T 21 \xB1 4 vs. UT 17 \xB1\
  \ 2; upper body: T 22 \xB1 3 vs. UT 18 \xB1 2 l/min; all P < 0.05). None of the\
  \ measured pulmonary, cardiovascular, or metabolic parameters interacted with maturity,\
  \ and the magnitude of the difference between T and UT girls was similar, irrespective\
  \ of maturity stage. These results challenge the notion that differences in training\
  \ status in young people are only evident once a maturational threshold has been\
  \ exceeded. \xA9 2011 the American Physiological Society."
