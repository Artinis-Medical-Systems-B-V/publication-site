abstract: Purpose This study assessed the association between changes in sublingual
  microcirculation after a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and successful extubation.  Materials
  and methods Sublingual microcirculation was assessed using an incident dark-field
  video microscope before and after each SBT and before extubation. Microcirculatory
  parameters before the SBT, at the end of the SBT, and before extubation were compared
  between the successful and failed extubation groups.  Results Forty-seven patients
  were enrolled and analysed in this study (34 patients in the successful extubation
  group and 13 patients in the failed extubation group). At the end of the SBT, the
  weaning parameters did not differ between the two groups. However, the total small
  vessel density (21.2 [20.4–23.7] versus 24.9 [22.6–26.5] mm/mm2), perfused small
  vessel density (20.6 [18.5–21.8] versus 23.1 [20.9–25] mm/mm2), proportion of perfused
  small vessels (91 [87–96] versus 95 [93–98] %), and microvascular flow index (2.8
  [2.7–2.9] versus 2.9 [2.9–3]) were significantly lower in the failed extubation
  group than in the successful extubation group. The weaning and microcirculatory
  parameters did not differ significantly between the two groups before the SBT.  Conclusions
  More patients are required to investigate the difference between baseline microcirculation
  before a successful SBT and the change in microcirculation at the end of the SBT
  between the successful and failed extubation groups. Better sublingual microcirculatory
  parameters at the end of SBT and before extubation are associated with successful
  extubation.
