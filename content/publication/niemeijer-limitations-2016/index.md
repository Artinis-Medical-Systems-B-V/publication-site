abstract: "The extent and speed of transient skeletal muscle deoxygenation during\
  \ exercise onset in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) are related to impairments\
  \ of local O2 delivery and utilization. This study examined the physiological background\
  \ of submaximal exercise performance in 19 moderately impaired patients with CHF\
  \ (Weber class A, B, and C) compared with 19 matched healthy control (HC) subjects\
  \ by measuring skeletal muscle oxygenation (SmO2) changes during cycling exercise.\
  \ All subjects performed two subsequent moderate-intensity 6-min exercise tests\
  \ (bouts 1 and 2) with measurements of pulmonary oxygen uptake kinetics and SmO2\
  \ using near-infrared spatially resolved spectroscopy at the vastus lateralis for\
  \ determination of absolute oxygenation values, amplitudes, kinetics (mean response\
  \ time for onset), and deoxygenation overshoot characteristics. In CHF, deoxygenation\
  \ kinetics were slower compared with HC (21.3 \xB1 5.3 s vs. 16.7 \xB1 4.4 s, P\
  \ < 0.05, respectively). After priming exercise (i.e., during bout 2), deoxygenation\
  \ kinetics were accelerated in CHF to values no longer different from HC (16.9 \xB1\
  \ 4.6 s vs. 15.4 \xB1 4.2 s, P = 0.35). However, priming did not speed deoxygenation\
  \ kinetics in CHF subjects with a deoxygenation overshoot, whereas it did reduce\
  \ the incidence of the overshoot in this specific group (P < 0.05). These results\
  \ provide evidence for heterogeneity with respect to limitations of O2 delivery\
  \ and utilization during moderate-intensity exercise in patients with CHF, with\
  \ slowed deoxygenation kinetics indicating a predominant O2 utilization impairment\
  \ and the presence of a deoxygenation overshoot, with a reduction after priming\
  \ in a subgroup, indicating an initial O2 delivery to utilization mismatch."
