abstract: 'Objectives This study examined the effects of acute normoxic and hypoxic
  exposure on neuromuscular and hemodynamic physiological responses performed during
  dynamic step muscle actions.  Methods Thirteen recreationally active men (mean ±
  SD age: 21.2 ± 2.9 yrs) performed dynamic leg extensions unilaterally under Normoxic
  (FiO2 = 21 %) and Hypoxic (FiO2 = 13 %) conditions in a randomized order at 20 %,
  40 %, 60 %, 80 %, and 100 % of their maximal strength. Electromyographic (EMG) amplitude,
  EMG frequency, (Oxygenated and Deoxygenated hemoglobin; OxyHb, DeoxyHb), Total hemoglobin
  (TotalHb), and skeletal muscle tissue oxygenation status (StO2) were measured from
  the vastus lateralis during all contractions.  Results There were no detectable
  differences in the neuromuscular responses between normoxia and hypoxia for EMG
  amplitude (p = 0.37–0.74) and frequency (p = 0.17–0.83). For EMG amplitude there
  were general increases with intensity (p textless 0.01–0.03). EMG frequency remained
  similar from 20% to 80% and then increased at 100 % effort (p = 0.02). There was
  no significant difference in patterns of responses for OxyHb (p = 0.870) and TotalHb
  (p = 0.200) between normoxia and hypoxia. StO2 (p = 0.028) decreased and DeoxyHb
  (p = 0.006) increased under hypoxia compared to normoxia during dynamic step muscle
  actions performed in a randomized order.  Conclusion Unlike fatigue, acute hypoxemia
  in an unfatigued state does not impact the localized neuromuscular responses, but
  minimally impacts the hemodynamic responses.'
