abstract: Interrogation of tissue with light offers the potential for noninvasive
  chemical measurement, and penetration with near-infrared wavelengths (750-1000 nm)
  is greater than with visible light. Specific absorption by clinically relevant compounds
  such as oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin and the intracellular respiratory enzyme cytochrome
  oxidase enable in vivo measurement of these to be performed safely and conveniently.
  This is the basis of in vivo near-infrared spectroscopy (ivNIRS). Multiple scattering
  of the interrogating beam by tissues leads to an optical path that is considerably
  longer than the simple physical pathlength and this complicates the analysis. Modeling
  of photon propagation through tissues with, for example, finite element and Monte
  Carlo methods, is assisting in improving the ivNIRS methodology. Instrumentation
  has advanced from simple continuous wave approaches, through time-resolved methods
  based on either time-domain or frequency-domain approaches, to spatially resolved
  measurement based on diffuse reflectance. Initial clinical applications were for
  monitoring the brain in the neonate and fetus and muscle in adults. Currently, use
  in adults and children for neurological assessments are of growing interest.
