abstract: 'This systematic review analyses advancements in cognitive state recognition
  from 2010 to early 2024, evaluating 405 relevant articles from an initial pool of
  2398 records identified through five databases: Scopus, Engineering Village, Web
  of Science, IEEE Xplore, and PubMed. Studies were included if they assessed cognitive
  states using physiological signals and applied machine learning (ML) or deep learning
  (DL) techniques in practical task settings. The review highlights a pivotal shift
  from shallow ML to DL approaches for analysing physiological signals, driven by
  DL’s ability to autonomously learn complex patterns in large datasets. By 2023,
  DL has become the dominant methodology, though traditional ML techniques remain
  relevant. Additionally, there has been a move from neuroimaging to multimodal physiological
  modalities, with the decrease in neuroimaging use reflecting a trend towards integrating
  various physiological signals for more comprehensive insights. Cognitive state recognition
  is applied across diverse domains such as the automotive, aviation, maritime, and
  healthcare industries, enhancing performance and safety in high-stakes environments.
  Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most utilised modality, with convolutional neural
  networks (CNNs) being the primary DL approach. The trend in cognitive state recognition
  research is moving towards integrating ECG signals with CNNs and adopting privacy-preserving
  methodologies like differential privacy and federated learning, highlighting the
  potential of cognitive state recognition to enhance performance, safety, and innovation
  across various real-world applications.'
