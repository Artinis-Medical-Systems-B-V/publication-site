abstract: "Objective: To explore measures of peripheral muscular oxygenation, coupled\
  \ to gait characteristics, between preterm and full-term children during a 6-minute\
  \ walking test (6MWT). Study design: Prepubescent children performed a 6MWT. During\
  \ the test, changes in muscular oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, and total hemoglobin\
  \ were measured with Near-infrared spectroscopy technology, positioned on subjects'\
  \ calves. Gait variables were monitored with the OptoGait system. Results: Forty-five\
  \ children (33 full-term children and 12 preterm children, mean age, 4.9 \xB1 0.7\
  \ and 4.6 \xB1 0.9 years, respectively) participated in this study. Statistical\
  \ analysis highlighted a decreased walking performance for preterm children, with\
  \ significantly lower walking distance (P <.05) than children born full-term (405.1\
  \ \xB1 91.8 m vs 461.0 \xB1 73.3 m respectively; \u22129%). A concomitant increase\
  \ of oxygen extraction (over the time course of Variation of desoxyhemoglobin) was\
  \ observed from the third minute of the test (P <.05). No statistically significant\
  \ difference was found for other near-infrared spectroscopy measures. Finally, the\
  \ analysis of gait variables highlighted a group effect for walking speed (P <.05)\
  \ and stride length (P <.01). Conclusions: Premature children showed decreased walking\
  \ performance and greater change in peripheral muscular oxygen extraction, associated\
  \ with slower walking speed and stride length. This may point to a muscular maladjustment\
  \ and reduced functional capacities for children born preterm. These phenomena could\
  \ be responsible for greater muscular fatigue."
