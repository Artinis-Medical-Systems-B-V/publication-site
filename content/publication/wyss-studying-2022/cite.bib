 abstract = {Understanding the effects of risk factors contributing to pressure injuries is critical for preventing the formation of these complex chronic wounds. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) provides a means to measure tissue oxygenation when external pressure is applied to soft tissue regions. In this study, we investigated the effects of external pressure on soft tissue oxygenation, while considering various intrinsic factors in healthy participants. Our preliminary results suggest an inverse correlation between tissue oxygenation levels and externally applied pressure, with variation in TSI and recovery time between participants indicating the potential effects of intrinsic factors on tissue oxygenation. Further research is required to fully characterize the observed relationship for pressure injury prevention.},
