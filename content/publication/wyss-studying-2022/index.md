abstract: Understanding the effects of risk factors contributing to pressure injuries
  is critical for preventing the formation of these complex chronic wounds. Near-infrared
  spectroscopy (NIRS) provides a means to measure tissue oxygenation when external
  pressure is applied to soft tissue regions. In this study, we investigated the effects
  of external pressure on soft tissue oxygenation, while considering various intrinsic
  factors in healthy participants. Our preliminary results suggest an inverse correlation
  between tissue oxygenation levels and externally applied pressure, with variation
  in TSI and recovery time between participants indicating the potential effects of
  intrinsic factors on tissue oxygenation. Further research is required to fully characterize
  the observed relationship for pressure injury prevention.
