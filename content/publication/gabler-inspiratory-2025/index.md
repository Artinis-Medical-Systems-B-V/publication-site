abstract: 'Introduction: Some evidence shows that an inspiratory muscle warm-up (IMW)
  could enhance exercise performance; however, outcomes are mixed, and the mechanistic
  basis is unclear. Therefore, our purpose was to examine how IMW affects the sensory
  and affective components of dyspnea, exercise performance, and locomotor muscle
  oxygenation. Methods: Thirteen recreationally active individuals (23 [5] y, 5 women)
  performed a cycling time-to-exhaustion test (∼80%–85% maximal oxygen uptake) preceded
  by either IMW (2 × 30 breaths, 40% maximal inspiratory pressure) or SHAM (2 × 30
  breaths, 15% maximal inspiratory pressure) in normoxic (FIO2 = 0.21) and hypoxic
  (FIO2 = 0.16) conditions (ie, 4 trials total). Near-infrared spectroscopy, dyspnea
  (ie, breathing intensity and breathing unpleasantness), and cardiorespiratory parameters
  were measured throughout. Cardiorespiratory variables were analyzed using the individual
  isotime method. Results: There were no differences in mean dyspnea responses between
  IMW and SHAM (P textgreater .05). Mean Δ tissue saturation index did not reach statistical
  significance between IMW and SHAM in normoxia (P = .110) or hypoxia (P = .07). Mean
  performance was not different in normoxia (P = .636) or hypoxia (P = .512). In normoxia,
  minute ventilation (P = .059) and breathing frequency (P = .056) approached significance
  with IMW values greater compared with SHAM in the third isotime. Conclusion: Group
  improvements in dyspnea, performance, and Δ tissue saturation index were not seen
  following IMW. However, the degree of selected individual responses suggests that
  this intervention has interindividual applicability that should not be overlooked.'
