abstract: The classic rubber hand illusion (RHI), based on visual, proprioceptive,
  and tactile feedback, can affect actions. However, it is not known whether these
  effects still occur if the paradigm is administered without visual feedback. In
  this study, we used the somatic RHI to test in thirty-two healthy individuals whether
  the incorporation of the rubber hand based on proprioceptive and tactile information
  only is sufficient to generate changes in actions. We measured maximum grip aperture
  (GA) changes towards a target and associated brain activations within the dorsal
  stream before and after the somatic RHI. Behavioural and neuroimaging data do not
  support an effect on maximum GA when the RHI is based on proprioceptive and tactile
  information only.
