abstract: 'Parkinson’s disease (PD) leads to impairments in cortical structures, resulting
  in motor and cognitive symptoms. Given the connection between brain structure deficits
  and physical symptoms in PD, assessing objective brain activity and body motion
  could provide valuable insights for PD assessment and understanding its underlying
  mechanisms. This study aimed to explore the connection between brain activity and
  body movement metrics in a group of individuals with PD and an age-matched healthy
  control (HC) group. The goal was to evaluate the feasibility of using brain and
  body motion measures for assessing PD. Participants from both groups underwent the
  Timed Up and Go (TUG) test under three conditions: simple TUG, cognitive dual-task
  TUG (CDTUG), and motor dual-task TUG (MDTUG). Key findings include: Both groups
  exhibited similar activation patterns in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during the
  simple TUG, with motor performance differences observed in cadence. During CDTUG,
  both groups showed the highest PFC activation with more pronounced motor impairments,
  such as higher stride and step time. During MDTUG, the HC group exhibited significantly
  higher PFC activity compared to the PD group. While both groups had similar patterns
  of activation in PFC area while TUG and CDTUG, they showed distinct behaviour during
  MDTUG. These results suggest that motor and cognitive impairments in PD are more
  pronounced during complex activities. While MDTUG effectively differentiated between
  PD and HC groups, the findings indicate that both cognitive and motor dual-tasks
  are essential for comprehensive PD assessment.'
