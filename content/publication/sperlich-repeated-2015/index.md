abstract: "Purpose: Splenic contraction induced by repeated apneas has been shown\
  \ to increase oxygen availability. Our aim was to determine whether repeated maximal\
  \ voluntary apnea enhances the performance of cyclists in a subsequent 4-km time\
  \ trial. Methods: Seven male cyclists [age: 27.1\_\xB1\_2.1 years; height: 182\_\
  \xB1\_8\_cm; body mass: 74.8\_\xB1\_9.2\_kg; peak oxygen uptake: 56.9\_\xB1\_6.6\_\
  mL\_min\u22121\_kg\u22121 (mean\_\xB1\_SD)] performed a 4-km time trial on an ergometer\
  \ with and without four prior maximal bouts of apnea interspersed with 2\_min of\
  \ recovery. Results: The average power output during the time trial was similar\
  \ with (293\_\xB1\_48\_W) and without (305\_\xB1\_42\_W) prior apnea (P\_=\_0.11,\
  \ d\_=\_0.27). The spleen was reduced in size after the fourth bout of apnea (\u2212\
  12.4\_\xB1\_9.0\_%), as well as one (\u221236.6\_\xB1\_10.3\_%) and 10\_min (\u2212\
  19.5\_\xB1\_17.9\_%) after the time trial, while with normal breathing the spleen\
  \ was smaller one (\u221235.0\_\xB1\_11.3\_%) and 10\_min (\u221223.4\_\xB1\_19.7\_\
  %) after the time trial. Heart rate; oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide production;\
  \ tissue oxygen saturation; and the lactate concentration, pH, oxygen saturation,\
  \ level of hemoglobin and hematocrit of the blood were similar under both conditions.\
  \ Conclusions: Our present findings reveal that four apneas by cyclists prior to\
  \ a 4-km time trial led to splenic contraction, but no change in mean power output,\
  \ the level of hemoglobin, hematocrit, oxygen saturation of the m. vastus lateralis\
  \ or oxygen uptake."
