abstract: "Purpose: To determine the effect of limb selection (upper/lower), cuff\
  \ width (small (6 cm)/medium (13 cm) upper; medium/large (18 cm) lower) and anthropometry\
  \ on arterial occlusion pressure (AOP) in ischemic preconditioning (IPC). Methods:\
  \ Twenty athletes (10 females and 10 males) had surface anthropometry and dual x-ray\
  \ absorptiometry (DXA) assessments before using Doppler ultrasound to confirm AOP\
  \ for each limb. Subsequently, 5 min of occlusion occurred, with near-infrared spectroscopy\
  \ (NIRS) measuring muscle oxygenation changes. Resultant AOP was compared between\
  \ sexes, limbs and cuff sizes using linear regression models. Results: Mean AOP\
  \ was higher in the lower limbs than the upper limbs (161 \xB1 18 vs. 133 \xB1 12\
  \ mm Hg; p <.001), and with smaller cuffs in upper (161 \xB1 16 vs. 133 \xB1 12\
  \ mm Hg; p <.001), but not lower limbs (161 \xB1 16 vs. 170 \xB1 26 mm Hg; p =.222).\
  \ Sex and resting systolic blood pressure (SBP) accounted for 77% (small cuff) to\
  \ 83% (medium cuff) of variance in AOP for upper limbs, and 61% (medium cuff) to\
  \ 63% (large cuff) in lower limbs. Including anthropometry accounted for 82% (small\
  \ cuff) to 89% (medium cuff) and 78% (medium cuff) to 79% (large cuff) of variance\
  \ for upper and lower limbs, respectively. Adding DXA variables improved the explained\
  \ variance up to 83% (small cuff) to 91% (medium cuff) and 79% (medium cuff) to\
  \ 87% (large cuff) for upper and lower limbs, respectively. NIRS data showed significantly\
  \ greater tissue oxygenation changes in upper versus lower limbs. Conclusions: The\
  \ AOP in athletes is dependent on limb occluded, sex, SBP, limb and cuff size, and\
  \ body composition."
