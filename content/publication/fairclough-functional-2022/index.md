abstract: The dorsal and ventral attention networks (DAN & VAN) provide a framework
  for studying attentional modulation of pain. It has been argued that cognitive demand
  distracts attention from painful stimuli via top-down reinforcement of task goals
  (DAN), whereas pain exerts an interruptive effect on cognitive performance via bottom-up
  pathways (VAN). The current study explores this explanatory framework by manipulating
  pain and task demand in combination with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
  and Granger Causal Connectivity Analyses (GCCA). Twenty-one participants played
  a racing game at low and high difficulty levels with or without experimental pain
  (administered via a cold pressor test). Six channels of fNIRS were collected from
  bilateral frontal eye fields and intraparietal sulci (DAN), with right-lateralised
  channels at the inferior frontal gyrus and temporoparietal junction (VAN). Our first
  analysis revealed increased G-causality from bottom-up pathways (VAN) during the
  cold pressor test. However, an equivalent experience of experimental pain during
  gameplay increased G-causality in top-down (DAN) pathways, with the left intraparietal
  sulcus serving a hub of connectivity. High game difficulty increased G-causality
  via top-down pathways and implicated the right inferior frontal gyrus as an interhemispheric
  hub. Our results are discussed with reference to existing models of both networks
  and attentional modulation of pain.
