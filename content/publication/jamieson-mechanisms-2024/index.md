abstract: 'The pathogenesis of exercise intolerance and persistent fatigue which can
  follow an infection with the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus (“long COVID”) is not fully understood.
  Cases were N= 32; 44 ± 12 years; 10 (31%) men), and age‐/sex‐matched healthy controls
  (HC) (N = 19; 40 ± 13 years; 6 (32%) men) from University College London staff and
  students. We assessed exercise performance, lung and cardiac function, vascular
  health, skeletal muscle oxidative capacity, and autonomic nervous system (ANS) function.
  Key outcome measures for each physiological system were compared between groups
  using potential outcome means (95% confidence intervals) adjusted for potential
  confounders. Long COVID participant outcomes were compared to normative values.
  When compared to HC, cases exhibited reduced oxygen uptake efficiency slope (1847
  (1679, 2016) vs. 2176 (1978, 2373) mL/min, p = 0.002) and anaerobic threshold (13.2
  (12.2, 14.3) vs. 15.6 (14.4, 17.2) mL/kg/min, p textless 0.001), and lower oxidative
  capacity, measured using near infrared spectroscopy (τ : 38.7 (31.9, 45.6) vs. 24.6
  (19.1, 30.1) s, p = 0.001). In cases, ANS measures fell below normal limits in 39%.
  Long COVID is associated with reduced measures of exercise performance and skeletal
  muscle oxidative capacity in the absence of evidence of microvascular dysfunction,
  suggesting mitochondrial pathology. There was evidence of attendant ANS dysregulation
  in a significant proportion. These multisystem factors might contribute to impaired
  exercise tolerance in long COVID sufferers.'
