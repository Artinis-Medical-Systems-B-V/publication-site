abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has been so far the golden
  standard to study the functional aspects of the cerebellum. In this paper, a low-cost
  alternative imaging, i.e. functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is demonstrated
  to achieve successful measurements of the cerebellar hemodynamics towards the challenging
  observation of motor and cognitive processes at the cerebellar level. The excitation
  and reception optodes need to be properly placed to circumvent a major hindering
  from the shielding by the neck muscles. A simple experimental protocol, i.e. finger
  tapping task, was implemented to observe the subject's engagement and the presence
  of functional asymmetries. Marked differences among subjects with different levels
  of lateralization were clearly noticed in terms of activation and latencies, together
  with peaks in the hemodynamic response following neural activation. These preliminary
  results suggest also differences in the hemodynamic behavior between the brain and
  the cerebellum and encourage future and extended analysis in this direction.Clinical
  Relevance-This establishes the possibility to use a novel technique (fNIRS) to study
  cerebellar hemodynamics instead of fMRI.
