abstract: "The study examined whether the aerobic fitness level modifies the cerebral\
  \ oxygenation response to incremental ramp exercise, and more specifically the decline\
  \ in cerebral oxygenation from heavy exercise up to maximal intensities. 11 untrained\
  \ (V\u02D9O2max 47.3\xB14.0mLmin-1kg-1) and 13 endurance-trained (V\u02D9O2max 61.2\xB1\
  8.0mLmin-1kg-1) healthy men performed a maximal ramp cycle exercise. Left prefrontal\
  \ cortex oxygenation ($\u03B4$HbO2) was monitored by near-infrared spectroscopy.\
  \ A cerebral oxygenation threshold decline (ThCOx) during exercise was determined.\
  \ ThCox occurred in all subjects but for higher V\u02D9O2 (mLmin-1kg-1) in endurance-trained\
  \ than in untrained subjects (P<0.01). At submaximal exercise intensity corresponding\
  \ to ThCOx, $\u03B4$HbO2 was higher in endurance-trained than in untrained subjects\
  \ (P<0.05). V\u02D9O2 at ThCox was related to V\u02D9O2 at respiratory compensation\
  \ point (n=24, r=0.93, P<0.001) and to V\u02D9O2max (n=24, r=0.92, P<0.001). These\
  \ findings indicate that above the respiratory compensation point the prefrontal\
  \ O2 demand exceeds the supply in untrained and in endurance-trained subjects. In\
  \ addition, the occurrence of ThCOx was delayed to higher absolute exercise intensities\
  \ in endurance-trained in relation with their higher V\u02D9O2max than untrained\
  \ men. These results demonstrated that aerobic fitness influences cerebral oxygenation\
  \ during exercise."
