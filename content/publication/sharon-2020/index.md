abstract: "Background: Previous reports show that patients with Parkinson's disease\
  \ (PD) rely on prefrontal activation to compensate for impaired motor function during\
  \ complex activities such as obstacle negotiation. However, the influence of the\
  \ properties of the obstacles on prefrontal activation has not been systematically\
  \ evaluated. Here, we examined the effects of obstacle height and anticipation time\
  \ on prefrontal activation in patients with PD and older adults. Methods: 34 patients\
  \ with PD (age: 67.4 \xB1 5.7 years; 14 women) and 26 older adults (age: 71.3 \xB1\
  \ 8.9 years; 11 women) walked in an obstacle course while negotiating anticipated\
  \ and unanticipated obstacles (long/short available time response, ART) at heights\
  \ of 50 mm and 100 mm. Prefrontal activation was measured using functional Near-Infrared\
  \ Spectroscopy (fNIRS); obstacle negotiation performance was measured using Kinect\
  \ cameras. Results: PD patients showed greater increases in prefrontal activation\
  \ during and after obstacle crossing compared to the older adults (p < 0.001). Obstacle\
  \ height affected prefrontal activity only when crossing anticipated obstacles (ARTxheight\
  \ interaction, p = 0.011), in which case higher obstacles were accompanied by higher\
  \ prefrontal activity. PD patients showed higher levels of activation during unanticipated\
  \ obstacles, compared to older adults (groupXART: p = 0.015). Different correlations\
  \ between prefrontal activation and obstacle negotiation strategies were observed\
  \ in patients and controls. Conclusions: These results point to the use of prefrontal\
  \ activation as a compensatory mechanism in PD. Moreover, the higher activation\
  \ observed when negotiating more challenging obstacles suggests that there is greater\
  \ reliance on cognitive resources in these demanding situations that may contribute\
  \ to the higher risk of falls in PD patients."
