abstract: "Purpose: High intensity interval training (HIIT) has been proposed as a\
  \ time-efficient format of exercise to reduce the chronic disease burden associated\
  \ with sedentary behaviour. Changes in oxygen utilisation at the local tissue level\
  \ during an acute session of HIIT could be the primary stimulus for the health benefits\
  \ associated with this format of exercise. The recovery periods of HIIT effect the\
  \ physiological responses that occur during the session. It was hypothesised that\
  \ in sedentary individuals, local and systemic oxygen utilisation would be higher\
  \ during HIIT interspersed with active recovery periods, when compared to passive\
  \ recovery periods. Methods: Twelve sedentary males (mean \xB1 SD; age 23 \xB1 3\
  \ yr) completed three conditions on a cycle ergometer: 1) HIIT with passive recovery\
  \ periods between four bouts (HIITPASS) 2) HIIT with active recovery periods between\
  \ four bouts (HIITACT) 3) HIITACT with four HIIT bouts replaced with passive periods\
  \ (REC). Deoxygenated haemoglobin (HHb) in the vastus lateralis (VL) and gastrocnemius\
  \ (GN) muscles and the pre-frontal cortex (FH), oxygen consumption (VO2), power\
  \ output and heart rate (HR) were measured continuously during the three conditions.\
  \ Results: There was a significant increase in HHb at VL during bouts 2 (p = 0.017),\
  \ 3 (p = 0.035) and 4 (p = 0.035) in HIITACT, compared to HIITPASS. Mean power output\
  \ was significantly lower in HIITACT, compared to HIITPASS (p < 0.001). There was\
  \ a significant main effect for site in both HIITPASS (p = 0.029) and HIITACT (p\
  \ = 0.005). There were no significant differences in VO2 and HR between HIITPASS\
  \ and HIITACT. Conclusions: The increase in HHb at VL and the lower mean power output\
  \ during HIITACT could indicate that a higher level of deoxygenation contributes\
  \ to decreased mechanical power in sedentary participants. The significant differences\
  \ in HHb between sites indicates the specificity of oxygen utilisation."
