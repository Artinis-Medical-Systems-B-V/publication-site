abstract: The present study was aimed at describing a semi-immersive virtual reality
  environment, driven by a 3D hand sensing device (LEAP Motion Controller), to define
  a virtual task based on a virtual ball moving on a virtual path. The prefrontal
  cortex haemodynamic responses during the execution of this demanding task were evaluated
  by a 16-channel functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) system. A bilateral
  ventrolateral prefrontal cortex activation was found during the virtual task. Although
  the proposed task has not been yet applied in the neuro-rehabilitation field, it
  has the potential to be adopted in the upper limb functional assessment and rehabilitation
  treatment.
