abstract: "Endothelial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury importantly contributes to\
  \ the poor prognosis during ischemic (myocardial) events. Preconditioning, i.e.,\
  \ repeated exposure to short periods of ischemia, effectively reduces endothelial\
  \ I/R injury. In the present study, we examined the hypothesis that exercise has\
  \ preconditioning effects on endothelial I/R injury. Therefore, we studied whether\
  \ an acute bout of endurance or interval exercise is able to protect against endothelial\
  \ I/R injury. In 17 healthy young subjects, we examined changes in brachial artery\
  \ endothelial function using flow-mediated dilation (FMD) before and after a bout\
  \ of high-intensity interval exercise, moderate-intensity endurance exercise, or\
  \ a control intervention. Subsequently, I/R injury was induced by inflation of a\
  \ blood pressure cuff around the upper arm to 220 mmHg for 20 min and 20 min of\
  \ reperfusion followed by another FMD measurement. Near-infrared spectrometry was\
  \ used to examine local tissue oxygenation during exercise. No differences in brachial\
  \ artery FMD were found at baseline for the three conditions. I/R induced a significant\
  \ decline in FMD (7.1 \xB1 2.3 to 4.3 \xB1 2.3, P < 0.001). When preceded by the\
  \ interval exercise bout, no change in FMD was present after I/R (7.7 \xB1 3.1 to\
  \ 7.2 \xB1 3.1, P = 0.56), whereas the decrease in FMD after I/R could not be prevented\
  \ by the endurance exercise bout (7.8 \xB1 3.1 to 3.8 \xB1 1.7, P < 0.001). In conclusion,\
  \ a single bout of lower limb interval exercise, but not moderate-intensity endurance\
  \ exercise, effectively prevents brachial artery endothelial I/R injury. This indicates\
  \ the presence of a remote preconditioning effect of exercise, which is selectively\
  \ present after short-term interval but not continuous exercise in healthy young\
  \ subjects."
