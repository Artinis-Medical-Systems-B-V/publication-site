abstract: "Background and purpose: Cerebrovascular responses to head-of-bed positioning\
  \ in patients with acute ischaemic stroke are heterogeneous, questioning the applicability\
  \ of general recommendations on head positioning. Cerebral autoregulation is impaired\
  \ to various extents after acute stroke, although it is unknown whether this affects\
  \ cerebral perfusion during posture change. We aimed to elucidate whether the cerebrovascular\
  \ response to head position manipulation depends on autoregulatory performance in\
  \ patients with ischaemic stroke. Methods: The responses of bilateral transcranial\
  \ Doppler ultrasound-determined cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) and local cerebral\
  \ blood volume (CBV), assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy of total hemoglobin\
  \ tissue concentration ([total Hb]), to head-of-bed lowering from 30\xB0 to 0\xB0\
  \ were determined in 39 patients with acute ischaemic stroke and 17 reference subjects\
  \ from two centers. Cerebrovascular autoregulatory performance was expressed as\
  \ the phase difference of the arterial pressure-to-CBFV transfer function. Results:\
  \ Following head-of-bed lowering, CBV increased in the reference subjects only ([total\
  \ Hb]: + 2.1 \xB1 2.0 vs. + 0.4 \xB1 2.6 $\u03BC$M; P < 0.05), whereas CBFV did\
  \ not change in either group. CBV increased upon head-of-bed lowering in the hemispheres\
  \ of patients with autoregulatory performance <50th percentile compared with a decrease\
  \ in the hemispheres of patients with better autoregulatory performance ([total\
  \ Hb]: +1.0 \xB1 1.3 vs. \u22120.5 \xB1 1.0 $\u03BC$M; P < 0.05). The CBV response\
  \ was inversely related to autoregulatory performance (r = \u22120.68; P < 0.001)\
  \ in the patients, whereas no such relation was observed for CBFV. Conclusion: This\
  \ study is the first to provide evidence that cerebral autoregulatory performance\
  \ in patients with acute ischaemic stroke affects the cerebrovascular response to\
  \ changes in the position of the head."
