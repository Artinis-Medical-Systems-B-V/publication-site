To compare calf muscle function and peripheral tissue perfusion in women with chronic venous disease (CVD) with mild/moderate and severe symptoms.
Methods
A cross-sectional study included women with CVD classified in stages C1, C2, and C3. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) assessed symptomatology and divided participants into two groups. Group I reported mild/moderate symptoms (VAS of 1-6), and group II severe symptoms (VAS of 7-10). Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to assess peripheral tissue perfusion through in venous occlusion and movement plethysmography protocols. Total venous volume, venous filling index, calf ejection fraction, retention fraction (RF_HHB) and residual volume fraction (RVF_HHB) were measured. The assessment of calf muscle function was performed using the Heel Rise Test (HRT), considering the test time (HRT_T) and the number of repetitions (HRT_N). Fisher's exact test was used to analyze the categorical data and the Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the variables.
Results
Fifty-five participants were included in this study. Thirty (55%) were in Group I while twenty-five (45%) were in Group II. Group I presented values of RVF_HHb of -25.42 and RF_HHb of -56.83, while group II of 56.28 and 21.50 in HHb (µmolL-1) (p=0.048 and p=0.035, respectively). Body mass index was significantly higher in group II (p=0.003). No significant difference in calf muscle function was observed between groups by HRT_T and HRT_RR.
Conclusion
Women with severe symptoms of CVD had less venous emptying and higher levels of reflux. The intensity of symptoms may be associated with high BMI levels.},
