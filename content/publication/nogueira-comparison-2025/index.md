abstract: Objective To compare calf muscle function and peripheral tissue perfusion
  in women with chronic venous disease (CVD) with mild/moderate and severe symptoms.
  Methods A cross-sectional study included women with CVD classified in stages C1,
  C2, and C3. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) assessed symptomatology and divided participants
  into two groups. Group I reported mild/moderate symptoms (VAS of 1-6), and group
  II severe symptoms (VAS of 7-10). Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to
  assess peripheral tissue perfusion through in venous occlusion and movement plethysmography
  protocols. Total venous volume, venous filling index, calf ejection fraction, retention
  fraction (RF_HHB) and residual volume fraction (RVF_HHB) were measured. The assessment
  of calf muscle function was performed using the Heel Rise Test (HRT), considering
  the test time (HRT_T) and the number of repetitions (HRT_N). Fisher's exact test
  was used to analyze the categorical data and the Mann-Whitney U test was used to
  compare the variables. Results Fifty-five participants were included in this study.
  Thirty (55%) were in Group I while twenty-five (45%) were in Group II. Group I presented
  values of RVF_HHb of -25.42 and RF_HHb of -56.83, while group II of 56.28 and 21.50
  in HHb (µmolL-1) (p=0.048 and p=0.035, respectively). Body mass index was significantly
  higher in group II (p=0.003). No significant difference in calf muscle function
  was observed between groups by HRT_T and HRT_RR. Conclusion Women with severe symptoms
  of CVD had less venous emptying and higher levels of reflux. The intensity of symptoms
  may be associated with high BMI levels.
