abstract: 'Background Erythrocytes are traditionally considered passive oxygen carriers,
  yet their energetic and redox metabolism plays a critical role in regulating oxygen
  kinetics. Objective This study integrates experimental and computational data to
  provide a comprehensive analysis of erythrocyte metabolism in response to exercise-induced
  oxidative stress. Methods The study consisted of three phases: in vivo, ex vivo,
  and computational. A total of 20 male participants underwent a randomized crossover
  experiment with two conditions: oxidative stress (eccentric contractions) and control.
  Oxidative stress was induced via leg eccentric contractions, and its effects on
  erythrocyte glycolytic and redox metabolism, arm muscle oxygenation, and arm exercise
  performance were evaluated. The study protocol was preregistered on the Open Science
  Framework (https://osf.io/ub6zs). Results Eccentric contractions altered oxidative
  stress markers in erythrocytes (+ 22% F2-isoprostanes, + 28% protein carbonyls, − 20%
  glutathione). Oxidative stress increased erythrocyte glycolytic flux by + 53%, while
  arm exercise further increased glycolytic flux in both control (+ 200%) and oxidative
  stress (+ 86%) conditions. Exogenous hydrogen peroxide administration reduced glycolytic
  flux by − 48%. Stoichiometric analysis revealed that during acute exercise, erythrocytes
  produced 14.9% less ATP, NADPH, and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate than their theoretical
  maximum, at the critical bioenergetic point. Oxidative stress decreased arm deoxygenated
  hemoglobin by − 7.4% during arm exercise and VO2peak by − 4% during arm exercise.
  Conclusion In a comprehensive exercise study investigating mechanistic relationships
  in erythrocyte biology, we show that erythrocyte metabolism (1) responds dynamically
  to exercise, (2) becomes dysregulated under oxidative stress, and (3) may partly
  influence muscle oxygenation and performance.'
