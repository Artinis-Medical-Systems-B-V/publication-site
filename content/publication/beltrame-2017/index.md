abstract: "New Findings: What is the central question of this study? The pulmonary\
  \ oxygen uptake ((Formula presented.)) data used to study the muscle aerobic system\
  \ dynamics during moderate-exercise transitions is classically described as a mono-exponential\
  \ function controlled by a complex interaction of the oxygen delivery\u2013utilization\
  \ balance. This elevated complexity complicates the acquisition of relevant information\
  \ regarding aerobic system dynamics based on (Formula presented.) data during a\
  \ varying exercise stimulus. What is the main finding and its importance? The elevated\
  \ complexity of (Formula presented.) dynamics is a consequence of a multiple-order\
  \ interaction between muscle oxygen uptake and circulatory distortion. Our findings\
  \ challenge the use of a first-order function to study the influences of the oxygen\
  \ delivery\u2013utilization balance over the (Formula presented.) dynamics. The\
  \ assumption of aerobic system linearity implies that the pulmonary oxygen uptake\
  \ ((Formula presented.)) dynamics during exercise transitions present a first-order\
  \ characteristic. The main objective of this study was to test the linearity of\
  \ the oxygen delivery\u2013utilization balance during random moderate exercise.\
  \ The cardiac output ((Formula presented.)) and deoxygenated haemoglobin concentration\
  \ ([HHb]) were measured to infer the central and local O2 availability, respectively.\
  \ Thirteen healthy men performed two consecutive pseudorandom binary sequence cycling\
  \ exercises followed by an incremental protocol. The system input and the outputs\
  \ (Formula presented.), [HHb] and (Formula presented.) were submitted to frequency-domain\
  \ analysis. The linearity of the variables was tested by computing the ability of\
  \ the response at a specific frequency to predict the response at another frequency.\
  \ The predictability levels were assessed by the coefficient of determination. In\
  \ a first-order system, a participant who presents faster dynamics at a specific\
  \ frequency should also present faster dynamics at any other frequency. All experimentally\
  \ obtained variables ((Formula presented.), [HHb] and (Formula presented.)) presented\
  \ a certainly degree of non-linearity. The local O2 availability, evaluated by the\
  \ ratio (Formula presented.) /[HHb], presented the most irregular behaviour. The\
  \ overall [HHb] kinetics were faster than (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.)\
  \ kinetics. In conclusion, the oxygen delivery\u2013utilization balance behaved\
  \ as a non-linear phenomenon. Therefore, the elevated complexity of the pulmonary\
  \ oxygen uptake dynamics is governed by a complex multiple-order interaction between\
  \ the oxygen delivery and utilization systems."
