abstract: "\xA9 2019 SPIE Background: A requisite for fNIRS studies of cortical blood\
  \ flow is that sufficient photons are transmitted transcutaneously for the fluctuations\
  \ in cerebral hemoglobin oxygenation that occur during neuronal activation to be\
  \ detected. Transmission is determined by the specifications of the fNIRS device,\
  \ but also influenced by the characteristics of the skin. Epidermal pigments can\
  \ attenuate photon transmission; the literature states that in dark skinned subjects\
  \ some NIRS devices may not achieve sufficient photon migration to monitor cortical\
  \ blood flow. Hence, as fNIRS use is spreading, we describe a simple head tilt maneuver\
  \ where positional redistribution of cerebral blood volume will confirm if photon\
  \ transmission is sufficient. Methods: A repetitive head tilt maneuver (bending\
  \ forward from a seated position, hold for 30 seconds, returning to original position\
  \ X 5) performed by a pigmented (African) subject and a non-pigmented (Caucasian)\
  \ subject. A 23- channel portable fNIRS system with dual wavelength (750 and 860\
  \ nm) emitters and photodiode detectors was worn over the anterior cortex, and changes\
  \ in oxy, deoxy and total hemoglobin concentration measured at 50 Hz. Results: Data\
  \ from both subjects were compared and found to have a comparable pattern of change\
  \ in oxyhemoglobin concentration and temporal response to the effects of head tilt;\
  \ clear arterial pulsations and minimal noise were also evident. Conclusion: We\
  \ suggest the head tilt maneuver described as a feasible test to confirm the adequacy\
  \ of transcutaneous photon transmission where fNIRS studies are to be performed\
  \ in subjects with pigmented skin to detect hemodynamic change in the cortex."
