abstract: "Nightmares are intensely negative dreams that awaken the dreamer. Frequent\
  \ nightmares are thought to reflect an executive deficit in regulating arousal.\
  \ Within a diathesis-stress framework, this arousal is specific to negative contexts,\
  \ though a differential susceptibility framework predicts elevated arousal in response\
  \ to both negative and positive contexts. The current study tested these predictions\
  \ by assessing subjective arousal and changes in frontal oxyhemoglobin (oxyHB) concentrations\
  \ during negative and positive picture-viewing in nightmare sufferers (NM) and control\
  \ subjects (CTL). 27 NM and 27 CTL subjects aged 18\u201335 rated subjective arousal\
  \ on a 1\u20139 scale following sequences of negative, neutral and positive images;\
  \ changes in oxyHB were measured by Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) using a 2\
  \ \xD7 4 template on the frontal pole. Participants also completed the Highly Sensitive\
  \ Person Scale, a trait marker for differential susceptibility; and completed a\
  \ dream diary reporting negative and positive dream emotionality. The NM group had\
  \ higher trait sensitivity, yet higher ratings of negative but not positive emotion\
  \ in diary dreams. NM compared to CTL subjects reported higher subjective arousal\
  \ in response to picture-viewing regardless of valence. Dysphoric dream distress,\
  \ measured prospectively, was negatively associated with frontal activation when\
  \ viewing negative pictures. Results suggest NM sufferers are highly sensitive to\
  \ images regardless of valence according to subjective measures, and that there\
  \ is a neural basis to level of trait and prospective nightmare distress. Future\
  \ longitudinal or intervention studies should further explore positive emotion sensitivity\
  \ and imagery in NM sufferers."
