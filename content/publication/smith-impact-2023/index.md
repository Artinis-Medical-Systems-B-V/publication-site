abstract: The purpose of this study was to investigate changes in gait patterns, motor
  dexterity, cognition, neuromuscular performance, neural activation of the prefrontal
  cortex, and perception of effort and exertion during a 60-min walking trial at a
  reduced body weight using a positive pressure treadmill (PPT). Eleven screened astronaut
  analog participants performed 60-min PPT sessions at either 100% (PPT100) or 20%
  body weight (PPT20) which were separated into six 10-min segments. During each segment,
  a 1-min gait analysis, Pegboard Task, Assembly Task, and Memory Recall Task were
  performed. Step frequency, rating of perceived physical and cognitive exertion,
  electromyographic amplitude and frequency from the vastus lateralis, metabolic markers,
  and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) of the prefrontal cortex were
  obtained for all segments during each condition. The primary findings of the study
  indicated that PPT20 was able to induce differences in step frequency relative to
  PPT100 and that PPT100 resulted in greater metabolic expenditures and electromyographic
  amplitude compared to PPT20. The PPT20, however, exhibited increased fNIRS prefrontal
  cortex activity during the Assembly Task and Memory Recall compared to the PPT100.
  In addition, the PPT20 resulted in an increase in Memory Recall errors compared
  to PPT100. In conclusion, the findings of the present study indicated that altered
  gait patterns associated with reduced weight does not impact basic motor dexterity
  tasks, such as gait and Pegboard Tasks, but does increase the difficulty of Assembly
  Tasks and Memory Recall in astronaut analogs. Thus, novel gait patterns can impact
  the cognitive loads that astronaut analogs can perform. Special considerations should
  be given to the impact that gravity-induced changes in gait patterns have on motor
  and cognitive tasks in future planetary exploration missions.
