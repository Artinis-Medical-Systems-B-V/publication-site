abstract: "This study aimed to examine if the faster pulmonary oxygen uptake (VO2p)\
  \ phase 2 in children could be explained by increased O 2 availability or extraction\
  \ at the muscle level. For that purpose, O 2 availability and extraction were assessed\
  \ using deoxyhemoglobin (HHb) estimated by near-infrared spectroscopy during moderate-intensity\
  \ constant load cycling exercise in children and young adults. Eleven prepubertal\
  \ boys and 12 men volunteered to participate in the study. They performed one maximal\
  \ graded exercise to determine the power associated with the gas exchange threshold\
  \ (GET) and four constant load exercises at 90% of GET. VO2p and HHb were continuously\
  \ monitored. VO2p, HHb, and estimated capillary blood flow ( Q \u0307 cap ) kinetics\
  \ were modelled after a time delay and characterized by the time to achieve 63%\
  \ of the amplitude ($\u03C4$) and by mean response time (MRT: time delay+$\u03C4\
  $), respectively. Mean values of $\u03C4$ for VO2p (P<0.001), of MRT for HHb (P<0.01)\
  \ and of MRT for Q \u0307 cap (P<0.001) were significantly shorter in children.\
  \ Faster VO2p kinetics have been shown in children; these appear due to both faster\
  \ O 2 extraction and delivery kinetics as indicated by faster HHb and Q \u0307 cap\
  \ kinetics, respectively. \xA9 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley\
