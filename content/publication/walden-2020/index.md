abstract: "Purpose: To investigate whether performing resistance exercise in hypoxia\
  \ augments physiological and perceptual responses, and if altering work-rate by\
  \ performing repetitions to failure compared to sub-maximally increases the magnitude\
  \ of these responses. Methods: Twenty male university students (minimum of 2\_year\
  \ resistance training experience) completed four sessions, two in hypoxia (fraction\
  \ of inspired oxygen [FiO2] = 0.13), and two in normoxia (FiO2 = 0.21). For each\
  \ condition, session one comprised three sets to failure of shoulder press and bench\
  \ press (high work-rate session), while session two involved the same volume load,\
  \ distributed over six sets (low work-rate session). Muscle oxygenation (triceps\
  \ brachii), surface electromyographic activity (anterior deltoid, pectoralis major,\
  \ and triceps brachii), heart rate (HR), and arterial blood oxygen saturation were\
  \ recorded. Blood lactate concentration ([Bla\u2212]) was recorded pre-exercise\
  \ and 2\_min after each exercise. Muscle thickness was measured pre- and post-exercise\
  \ via ultrasound. Results: Muscle oxygenation values during sets and inter-set rest\
  \ periods were lower in hypoxia vs normoxia (p = 0.001). Hypoxia caused greater\
  \ [Bla\u2212] during the shoulder press of failure sessions (p = 0.003) and both\
  \ shoulder press (p = 0.048) and bench press (p = 0.005) of non-failure sessions.\
  \ Hypoxia increased HR during non-failure sessions (p < 0.001). There was no effect\
  \ of hypoxia on muscular swelling, surface electromyographic activity, perceived\
  \ exertion, or number of repetitions performed. Conclusions: Hypoxia augmented metabolite\
  \ accumulation, but had no impact on any other physiological or perceptual response\
  \ compared to the equivalent exercise in normoxia. Furthermore, the magnitude to\
  \ which hypoxia increased the measured physiological responses was not influenced\
  \ by sessional work-rate."
