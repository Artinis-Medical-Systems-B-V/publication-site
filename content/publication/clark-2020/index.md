abstract: "Objectives: This pilot study assessed whether frontal lobe transcranial\
  \ direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with complex walking rehabilitation\
  \ is feasible, safe, and shows preliminary efficacy for improving walking and executive\
  \ function. Materials and Methods: Participants were randomized to one of the following\
  \ 18-session interventions: active tDCS and rehabilitation with complex walking\
  \ tasks (Active/Complex); sham tDCS and rehabilitation with complex walking tasks\
  \ (Sham/Complex); or sham tDCS and rehabilitation with typical walking (Sham/Typical).\
  \ Active tDCS was delivered over F3 (cathode) and F4 (anode) scalp locations for\
  \ 20 min at 2 mA intensity. Outcome measures included tests of walking function,\
  \ executive function, and prefrontal activity measured by functional near infrared\
  \ spectroscopy. Results: Ninety percent of participants completed the intervention\
  \ protocol successfully. tDCS side effects of tingling or burning sensations were\
  \ low (average rating less than two out of 10). All groups demonstrated gains in\
  \ walking performance based on within-group effect sizes (d \u2265 0.50) for one\
  \ or more assessments. The Sham/Typical group showed the greatest gains for walking\
  \ based on between-group effect sizes. For executive function, the Active/Complex\
  \ group showed the greatest gains based on moderate to large between-group effect\
  \ sizes (d = 0.52\u20131.11). Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) findings\
  \ suggest improved prefrontal cortical activity during walking. Conclusions: Eighteen\
  \ sessions of walking rehabilitation combined with tDCS is a feasible and safe intervention\
  \ for older adults. Preliminary effects size data indicate a potential improvement\
  \ in executive function by adding frontal tDCS to walking rehabilitation. This study\
  \ justifies future larger clinical trials to better understand the benefits of combining\
  \ tDCS with walking rehabilitation."
