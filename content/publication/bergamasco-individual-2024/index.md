abstract: 'We aimed to compare individual hypertrophic responses to high-load resistance
  training (HL-RT) or high-load with blood flow restriction (HL-BFR). Furthermore,
  we investigated whether greater responsiveness to one of the protocols could be
  explained by acute changes in blood deoxyhemoglobin concentration (HHb) and total
  hemoglobin concentration (tHb) (proxy markers of metabolic stress). Ten untrained
  participants had their legs randomized into both HL-RT and HL-BFR and underwent
  10 weeks of training. Muscle cross-sectional area (mCSA) was measured at baseline
  and post training, while HHb and tHb during the final session. Using a threshold
  of 2 × typical errors (3.24%) to compare protocols, five participants showed greater
  mCSA increases after HL-RT (16.44 ± 7.90%) compared to HL-BFR (10.74 ± 7.12%, p = 0.0054)
  and five did not respond better to HL-RT (8.95 ± 10.83%) compared to HL-BFR (13.33 ± 8.59%)
  (p = 0.3105). Additionally, HL-RT induced lower HHb (5855.78 ± 12905.99; p = 0.0101)
  and tHb (−43169.70 ± 37793.17; p = 0.0030) AUC values compared to HL-BFR (HHb: 39254.80 ± 27020.15;
  tHb: 46309.40 ± 31613.97). In conclusion, despite the higher levels of metabolic
  stress markers, most participants did not present greater muscle hypertrophy by
  combining blood flow restriction with HL-RT.'
