abstract: Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to assess human motor-cortex
  oxygenation changes in response to cyclic coupled movements of hand and foot. Using
  a highly sensitive NIRS instrument, we showed that it was possible to detect reproducible
  oxygenation patterns using single cycles (20 s) of easy and difficult association
  tasks. No significant differences in the time corresponding to the maximal changes
  in concentration of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin ([O2Hb] and [HHb], respectively) were
  found during easy and difficult association as well as cycles. Only [O2Hb] showed
  a significantly higher value at the end of the difficult association during the
  first cycle. No significant differences were found for [O2Hb] and [HHb] in the other
  cycles. We conclude that NIRS is a useful addition to functional magnetic resonance
  imaging in investigating the time course of cortical activation.
