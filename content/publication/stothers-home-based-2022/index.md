abstract: 'Background: Worldwide textless4 billion people suffer from urinary tract
  symptoms that negatively affect quality of life and incur significant cost. Currently,
  clinical assessment requires invasive urodynamic testing; as this involves catheterization
  in clinic/hospital settings, only periodic assessment is possible. This is problematic
  as treatment requirements vary over time; home-based monitoring/assessment able
  to optimize care would benefit patients and physicians. Methods: A monitoring system
  integrating a wireless uroflow scale with a wearable transcutaneous near infrared
  spectroscopy (NIRS) device was designed incorporating end-user feedback, and the
  feasibility of home use to asses voiding function tested. The NIRS device is worn
  superior to the pubis during voiding. Light emitting diodes (wavelengths of 760
  and 850 nm) allow transcutaneous monitoring of changes in chromophore concentration
  in the bladder detrusor muscle. The scale collects the urine voided, recording volume
  increments of 1cc. Data are transmitted wirelessly; incorporated software generates
  graphs of NIRS chromophore parameters indicative of hemodynamic and oxygenation
  effects as the bladder contracts, and uroflow data (total volume, mean and average
  flow rate, peak flow and pattern of uroflow). Results: Serial measures were recorded
  during spontaneous voiding by an asymptomatic 59-year-old male and a 78-yearold
  male with lower urinary tract symptoms. During each void, consistent NIRS-derived
  changes in chromophore concentrations individual to each subject were seen, and
  simultaneous uroflow measurements successfully recorded. Conclusion: Home based
  non-invasive NIRS monitoring of bladder function with simultaneous measurement of
  uroflow is feasible. This technology is capable of providing the repeated measures
  required to optimize disease monitoring and treatment.'
