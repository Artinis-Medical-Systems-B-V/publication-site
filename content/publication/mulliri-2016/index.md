abstract: "Ischemic preconditioning (IP) has been shown to improve exercise performance\
  \ and to delay fatigue. However, the precise mechanisms through which IP operates\
  \ remain elusive. It has been hypothesized that IP lowers the sensation of fatigue\
  \ by reducing the discharge of group III and IV nerve endings, which also regulate\
  \ hemodynamics during the metaboreflex. We hypothesized that IP reduces the blood\
  \ pressure response during the metaboreflex. Fourteen healthy males (age between\
  \ 25 and 48 yr) participated in this study. They underwent the following randomly\
  \ assigned protocol: postexercise muscle ischemia (PEMI) test, during which the\
  \ metaboreflex was elicited after dynamic handgrip; control exercise recovery session\
  \ (CER) test; and PEMI after IP (IP-PEMI) test. IP was obtained by occluding forearm\
  \ circulation for three cycles of 5 min spaced by 5 min of reperfusion. Hemodynamics\
  \ were evaluated by echocardiography and impedance cardiography. The main results\
  \ were that after IP the mean arterial pressure response was reduced compared with\
  \ the PEMI test (means \xB1 SD +3.37 \xB1 6.41 vs. +9.16 \xB1 7.09 mmHg, respectively).\
  \ This was the consequence of an impaired venous return that impaired the stroke\
  \ volume during the IP-PEMI more than during the PEMI test (\u22121.43 \xB1 15.35\
  \ vs. +10.28 \xB1 10.479 ml, respectively). It was concluded that during the metaboreflex,\
  \ IP affects hemodynamics mainly because it impairs the capacity to augment venous\
  \ return and to recruit the cardiac preload reserve. It was hypothesized that this\
  \ is the consequence of an increased nitric oxide production, which reduces the\
  \ possibility to constrict venous capacity vessels."
