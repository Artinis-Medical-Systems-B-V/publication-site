abstract: 'Background: Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) relative concentration signals
  contain ‘noise’ from physiological processes such as respiration and heart rate.
  Simultaneous assessment of NIRS and respiratory rate (RR) using a single sensor
  would facilitate a perfectly time-synced assessment of (cerebral) physiology. Our
  aim was to extract respiratory rate from cerebral NIRS intensity signals in neonates
  admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Methods: A novel algorithm, NRR
  (NIRS RR), is developed for extracting RR from NIRS signals recorded from critically
  ill neonates. In total, 19 measurements were recorded from ten neonates admitted
  to the NICU with a gestational age and birth weight of 38 ± 5 weeks and 3092 ± 990
  g, respectively. We synchronously recorded NIRS and reference RR signals sampled
  at 100 Hz and 0.5 Hz, respectively. The performance of the NRR algorithm is assessed
  in terms of the agreement and linear correlation between the reference and extracted
  RRs, and it is compared statistically with that of two existing methods. Results:
  The NRR algorithm showed a mean error of 1.1 breaths per minute (BPM), a root mean
  square error of 3.8 BPM, and Bland–Altman limits of agreement of 6.7 BPM averaged
  over all measurements. In addition, a linear correlation of 84.5% (p textless 0.01)
  was achieved between the reference and extracted RRs. The statistical analyses confirmed
  the significant (p textless 0.05) outperformance of the NRR algorithm with respect
  to the existing methods. Conclusions: We showed the possibility of extracting RR
  from neonatal NIRS in an intensive care environment, which showed high correspondence
  with the reference RR recorded. Adding the NRR algorithm to a NIRS system provides
  the opportunity to record synchronously different physiological sources of information
  about cerebral perfusion and respiration by a single monitoring system. This allows
  for a concurrent integrated analysis of the impact of breathing (including apnea)
  on cerebral hemodynamics.'
