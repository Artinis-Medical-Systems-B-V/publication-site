abstract: "Occasionally firefighters need to perform very heavy bouts of work, such\
  \ as smoke diving or clearing an accident site, which induce significant muscle\
  \ fatigue. The time span for muscular recovery from such heavy work is not known.\
  \ The purpose of this study was to evaluate firefighters' force-, neural-, metabolic-,\
  \ and structural-related recovery after task-specific heavy work in the heat. Fifteen\
  \ healthy firefighters (14 males and 1 female) performed a 20-min heavy work bout\
  \ that simulated smoke diving and the clearance of an accident site at 35 \xB0C.\
  \ After the work, muscular recovery was evaluated by wrist flexion maximal voluntary\
  \ contraction (MVC), average electromyography during MVC and during 10%MVC, rate\
  \ of force production, motor response and stretch reflex responses, muscle oxygen\
  \ consumption and oxygenation level, and wrist flexor muscle pennation angle. Recovery\
  \ was followed for 4 h. Each of the 12 measured parameters changed significantly\
  \ (p < 0.05) from those at baseline during the follow-up. Muscle oxygen consumption\
  \ and the wrist flexor pennation angle remained elevated throughout the follow-up\
  \ (oxygen consumption baseline, 12.9 \xB1 1.7 mL O2\u02D9min-1\u02D9(100 g)-1; 4-h\
  \ value, 17.5 \xB1 1.6 mL O2\u02D9min<sup>-</sup>1\u02D9(100 g)<sup>-1</sup>; p\
  \ < 0.05 and pennation angle baseline, 15.7 \xB1 0.8\xB0; 4-h value, 17.8 \xB1 0.8\xB0\
  ; p < 0.05). Muscle reoxygenation rate was elevated for up to 2 h (baseline, 2.3\
  \ \xB1 0.4 $\u03BC$mol\u02D9L<sup>-1</sup>\u02D9min<sup>-1</sup>; 2-h value, 3.4\
  \ \xB1 0.4 $\u03BC$mol\u02D9L<sup>-1</sup>\u02D9min-1; p < 0.05). The other 9 parameters\
  \ recovered (were no longer significantly different from baseline) after 20 to 60\
  \ min. We concluded that the recovery order in main components of muscle function\
  \ from fastest to slowest was force, neural, metabolic, and structural."
