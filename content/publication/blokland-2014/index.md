abstract: "Combining electrophysiological and hemodynamic features is a novel approach\
  \ for improving current performance of brain switches based on sensorimotor rhythms\
  \ (SMR). This study was conducted with a dual purpose: to test the feasibility of\
  \ using a combined electroencephalogram/functional near-infrared spectroscopy (EEG-fNIRS)\
  \ SMR-based brain switch in patients with tetraplegia, and to examine the performance\
  \ difference between motor imagery and motor attempt for this user group. A general\
  \ improvement was found when using both EEG and fNIRS features for classification\
  \ as compared to using the single-modality EEG classifier, with average classification\
  \ rates of 79% for attempted movement and 70% for imagined movement. For the control\
  \ group, rates of 87% and 79% were obtained, respectively, where the 'attempted\
  \ movement' condition was replaced with 'actual movement.' A combined EEG-fNIRS\
  \ system might be especially beneficial for users who lack sufficient control of\
  \ current EEG-based brain switches. The average classification performance in the\
  \ patient group for attempted movement was significantly higher than for imagined\
  \ movement using the EEG-only as well as the combined classifier, arguing for the\
  \ case of a paradigm shift in current brain switch research. \xA9 2013 IEEE."
