abstract: Functional neuroimaging provides an avenue for earlier diagnosis and tailored
  treatment of psychological disorders characterized by emotional impairment. Near-infrared
  spectroscopy offers ecological advantages compared to other neuroimaging techniques
  and suitability of measuring regions involved in emotion functions. A systematic
  review was conducted to evaluate the capacity of NIRS to detect activation during
  emotion processing and to provide recommendations for future research. Following
  a comprehensive literature search, we reviewed 85 journal articles which compared
  activation during emotional experience, regulation or perception with either a neutral
  condition or baseline period among healthy participants. The quantitative synthesis
  of outcomes was limited to thematical analysis, owing to the lack of standardisation
  between studies. Although most studies found increased prefrontal activity during
  emotional experience and regulation, the findings were more inconsistent for emotion
  perception. Some researchers reported increased activity during the task, some reported
  decreases, some no significant changes, and some reported mixed findings depending
  on the valence and region. We propose that variations in the cognitive task and
  stimuli, recruited sample, and measurement and analysis of data are the primary
  causes of inconsistency. Recommendations to improve consistency in future research
  by carefully considering the choice of population, cognitive task and analysis approach
  are provided.
