abstract: Monitoring the metabolic cost or oxygen consumption associated with rest
  and exercise is crucial to understanding the impact of disease or physical training
  on the health of individuals. Traditionally, measuring the skeletal muscle oxygen
  cost associated with exercise/muscle contractions can be rather expensive or invasive
  (i.e., muscle biopsies). More recently, specific protocols designed around the use
  of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) have been shown to provide a quick, non-invasive
  easy to use tool to measure skeletal muscle oxygen consumption (mVO 2 ). However,
  the data and results from NIRS devices are often misunderstood. Thus, the primary
  purpose of this sourcebook update is to provide several experimental protocols students
  can utilize to improve their understanding of NIRS technology, learn how to analyze
  results from NIRS devices as well as better understand how muscle contraction intensity
  and type (isometric, concentric or eccentric) influence the oxygen cost of muscle
  contractions.
