abstract: "The purpose of this study was to examine O 2 uptake (VO 2) on-kinetics\
  \ when the spontaneous blood flow (and therefore O 2 delivery) onresponse was slowed\
  \ by 25 and 50 s. The isolated gastrocnemius muscle complex (GS) in situ was studied\
  \ in six anesthetized dogs during transitions from rest to a submaximal metabolic\
  \ rate (\u030350- 70% of peak VO 2). Four trials were performed: 1) a pretrial in\
  \ which resting and steady-state blood flows were established, 2) a control trial\
  \ in which the blood flow on-kinetics mean response time (MRT) was set at 20 s (CT20),\
  \ 3) an experimental trial in which the blood flow on-kinetics MRT was set at 45\
  \ s (EX45), and 4) an experimental trial in which the blood flow on-kinetics MRT\
  \ was set at 70 s (EX70). Slowing O 2 delivery via slowing blood flow on-kinetics\
  \ resulted in a linear slowing of the VO 2 on-kinetics response (R = 0.96). Average\
  \ MRT values for CT20, EX45, and EX70 VO 2 on-kinetics were (means \xB1 SD) 17 \xB1\
  \ 2, 23 \xB1 4, and 26 \xB1 3 s, respectively (P < 0.05 among all). During these\
  \ transitions, slowing blood flow resulted in greater muscle deoxygenation (as indicated\
  \ by near-infrared spectroscopy), suggesting that lower intracellular PO 2 values\
  \ were reached. In this oxidative muscle, VO 2 and O 2 delivery were closely matched\
  \ during the transition period from rest to steady-state contractions. In conjunction\
  \ with our previous work showing that speeding O 2 delivery did not alter VO 2 on-kinetics\
  \ under similar conditions, it appears that spontaneously perfused skeletal muscle\
  \ operates at the nexus of sufficient and insufficient O 2 delivery in the transition\
  \ from rest to contractions. Copyright \xA9 2012 the American Physiological Society."
