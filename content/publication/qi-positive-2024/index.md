abstract: Exercise has shown to have beneficial effects on cognition in older adults.
  The purpose of this study was to investigate the cortical hemodynamic responses
  during the word-color Stroop test (WCST) prior and after acute walking and Tai Chi
  exercise by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Twenty participants (9
  males, mean age 62.8 Â± 5.2), first underwent a baseline WCST test, after which they
  took three WCST tests in a randomized order, (a) after sitting rest (control), (b)
  after 6 minutes performing Tai Chi Quan, and (c) after a bout of 6 minutes brisk
  walking. During these four WCST tests cortical hemodynamic changes in the prefrontal
  area were monitored with fNIRS. Both brisk walking and Tai Chi enhanced hemodynamic
  activity during the Stroop incongruent tasks, leading to improved cognitive performance
  (quicker reaction time). Brisk walking induced a greater hemodynamic activity in
  the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex
  (VLPFC) area, whereas Tai Chi induced a greater bilateral hemodynamic activity in
  the DLPFC and VLPFC areas. The present study provided empirical evidence of enhanced
  hemodynamic response in task- specific regions of the brain that can be achieved
  by a mere six minutes of brisk walking or Tai Chi in older adults.
