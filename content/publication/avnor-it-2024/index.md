abstract: While extant research on empathy has made significant progress in uncovering
  the mechanisms underlying the responses of an observer (empathizer) to the distress
  of another (target), it remains unclear how the interaction between the empathizer
  and the target contributes to distress regulation in the target. Here, we propose
  that behavioral and neural coupling during empathic interactions contribute to diminished
  distress. From November 2020 to November 2022, we recruited 37 pairs of previously
  unacquainted participants (N = 74) from multicultural backgrounds. They engaged
  in a 5 min face-to-face emotional sharing task, where one participant shared a distressing
  biographical experience with the other participant. We used functional near-infrared
  spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure interbrain coupling in the emotion regulation system,
  specifically the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and the observation execution
  system, specifically the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Results indicate that during
  emotional sharing the target and the empathizer emotionally converge, such that
  the empathizer becomes sadder. Moreover, the levels of empathizersâ€™ empathy predicted
  both emotional convergence and target distress relief. The neuroimaging findings
  indicate that interbrain coupling in the dlPFC, IFG, and premotor cortex, predicted
  distress relief in the target, and more critically that interbrain coupling in the
  dlPFC played a mediating role in the relationship between distress relief and the
  levels of empathy of the empathizer. Considering the role of the dlPFC in emotion
  regulation, we conclude that interbrain coupling in this region during emotional
  sharing plays a key role in dyadic coregulation of distress.
