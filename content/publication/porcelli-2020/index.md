abstract: "Key points: Increased plasma nitrite concentrations may have beneficial\
  \ effects on skeletal muscle function. The physiological basis explaining these\
  \ observations has not been clearly defined and it may involve positive effects\
  \ on muscle contraction force, microvascular O2 delivery and skeletal muscle oxidative\
  \ metabolism. In the isolated canine gastrocnemius model, we evaluated the effects\
  \ of acute nitrite infusion on muscle force and skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism.\
  \ Under hypoxic conditions, but in the presence of normal convective O2 delivery,\
  \ an elevated plasma nitrite concentration affects neither muscle force, nor muscle\
  \ contractile economy. In accordance with previous results suggesting limited or\
  \ no effects of nitrate/nitrite administrations in highly oxidative and highly perfused\
  \ muscle, our data suggest that neither mitochondrial respiration, nor muscle force\
  \ generation are affected by acute increased concentrations of NO precursors in\
  \ hypoxia. Abstract: Contrasting findings have been reported concerning the effects\
  \ of augmented nitric oxide (NO) on skeletal muscle force production and oxygen\
  \ consumption ((Formula presented.)). The present study examined skeletal muscle\
  \ mitochondrial respiration and contractile economy in an isolated muscle preparation\
  \ during hypoxia (but normal convective O2 delivery) with nitrite infusion. Isolated\
  \ canine gastrocnemius muscles in situ (n\_=\_8) were studied during 3\_min of electrically\
  \ stimulated isometric tetanic contractions corresponding to \u223C35% of (Formula\
  \ presented.). During contractions, sodium nitrite (NITRITE) or sodium chloride\
  \ (SALINE) was infused into the popliteal artery. (Formula presented.) was calculated\
  \ from the Fick principle. Experiments were carried out in hypoxia ((Formula presented.)\
  \ =\_0.12), whereas convective O2 delivery was maintained at normal levels under\
  \ both conditions by pump-driven blood flow ((Formula presented.)). Muscle biopsies\
  \ were taken and mitochondrial respiration was evaluated by respirometry. Nitrite\
  \ infusion significantly increased both nitrite and nitrate concentrations in plasma.\
  \ No differences in force were observed between conditions. (Formula presented.)\
  \ was not significantly different between NITRITE (6.1\_\xB1\_1.8\_mL (Formula presented.)\
  \ 100\_g\u22121\_min\u22121) and SALINE (6.2\_\xB1\_1.8\_mL\_100\_g\u22121\_min\u2212\
  1), even after being \u2018normalized' per unit of developed force (muscle contractile\
  \ economy). No differences between conditions were found for maximal ADP-stimulated\
  \ mitochondrial respiration (both for complex I and complex II), leak respiration\
  \ and oxidative phosphorylation coupling. In conclusion, in the absence of changes\
  \ in convective O2 delivery, muscle force, muscle contractile economy and mitochondrial\
  \ respiration were not affected by acute infusion of nitrite. The previously reported\
  \ positive effects of elevated plasma nitrite concentrations are presumably mediated\
  \ by the increased microvascular O2 availability."
