abstract: The present study investigated the maintenance/repeatability of expiratory
  flow limitation (EFL) between normoxia and hypoxia.  Fifty-one healthy active individuals
  (27 men and 24 women) performed a lung function test and a maximal incremental cycling
  test in both normoxia and hypoxia (inspired oxygen fraction = 0.14) on two separate
  visits.  During exercise in normoxia, 28 participants exhibited EFL (55 %). In hypoxia,
  another cohort of 28 participants exhibited EFL. The two groups only partly overlapped.  Individuals
  with EFL only in normoxia reported lower maximal ventilation values in hypoxia than
  in normoxia (n=5; −13.5 ± 7.8 %) compared to their counterparts with EFL only in
  hypoxia (n=5; +6.7 ± 6.3 %) or without EFL (n=18; +5.1 ± 10.3 %) (p=0.004 and ptextless0.001,
  respectively).  EFL development may be induced by different mechanisms in hypoxia
  vs. normoxia since the individuals who exhibited flow limitation were not the same
  between the two environmental conditions. This change seems influenced by the magnitude
  of the maximal ventilation change.
