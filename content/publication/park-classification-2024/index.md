abstract: Objective To date, early detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has
  mainly depended on paper-based neuropsychological assessments. Recently, biomarkers
  for MCI detection have gained a lot of attention because of the low sensitivity
  of neuropsychological assessments. This study proposed the functional near-infrared
  spectroscopy (fNIRS)-derived data with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify
  MCI.Methods Eighty-two subjects with MCI and 148 healthy controls (HC) performed
  the 2-back task, and their oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) changes in the prefrontal
  cortex (PFC) were recorded during the task. The CNN model based on fNIRS-derived
  spatial features with HbO2 slope within time windows was trained to classify MCI.
  Thereafter, the 5-fold cross-validation approach was used to evaluate the performance
  of the CNN model.Results Significant differences in averaged HbO2 values between
  MCI and HC groups were found, and the CNN model could better discriminate MCI with
  over 89.57% accuracy than the Korean version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment
  (MoCA) (89.57%). Specifically, the CNN model based on HbO2 slope within the time
  window of 20â€“60 seconds from the left PFC (96.09%) achieved the highest accuracy.Conclusion
  These findings suggest that the fNIRS-derived spatial features with CNNs could be
  a promising way for early detection of MCI as a surrogate for a conventional screening
  tool and demonstrate the superiority of the fNIRS-derived spatial features with
  CNNs to the MoCA.
