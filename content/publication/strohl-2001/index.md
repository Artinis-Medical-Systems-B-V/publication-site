abstract: "The relationship between alterations in cerebral blood volume (CBV) and\
  \ central chemosensitivity regulation was studied under neutral metabolic conditions\
  \ and during metabolic acidosis. Fifteen healthy subjects (56\xB110 years) were\
  \ investigated. To induce metabolic acidosis, ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) was given\
  \ orally. CBV was measured using Near Infrared Spectroscopy during normo- and hypercapnia\
  \ and related to inspired ventilation (V\u0307i). A mean acute metabolic acidosis\
  \ of $\u0394$pH -0.04 was realized with a mean decreased arterialized capillary\
  \ PCO2 (PcCO2) of 0.20 kPa (1.5 mmHg) (both P<0.001). During normocapnia, CBV was\
  \ 3.51\xB10.71 and 3.65\xB10.56 ml 100 g-1 (mean\xB1S.D.), measured under neutral\
  \ metabolic conditions and during acute metabolic acidosis, respectively (ns). Corresponding\
  \ values of V\u0307i were 7.6\xB11.4 and 10.0\xB12.4 l min-1 (P<0.01), respectively.\
  \ The slopes of the CO2-responsiveness ($\u0394$CBV/$\u0394$PcCO2 and $\u0394$V\u0307\
  i/$\u0394$PcCO2), were not significantly different during both metabolic conditions.\
  \ A significant correlation between $\u0394$CBV/$\u0394$PcCO2 and $\u0394$V\u0307\
  i/$\u0394$PcCO2 was found during metabolic acidosis (P<0.01), but not under neutral\
  \ metabolic conditions. CBV does not contribute in a predictable way to the regulation\
  \ of central chemoreceptors. Copyright \xA9 2001 Elsevier Science B.V."
