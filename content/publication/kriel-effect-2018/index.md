abstract: "Background: High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has been proposed as\
  \ a time-efficient exercise format to improve exercise adherence, thereby targeting\
  \ the chronic disease burden associated with sedentary behaviour. Exercise mode\
  \ (cycling, running), if self-selected, will likely affect the physiological and\
  \ enjoyment responses to HIIT in sedentary individuals. Differences in physiological\
  \ and enjoyment responses, associated with the mode of exercise, could potentially\
  \ influence the uptake and continued adherence to HIIT. It was hypothesised that\
  \ in young sedentary men, local and systemic oxygen utilisation and enjoyment would\
  \ be higher during a session of running HIIT, compared to a session of cycling HIIT.\
  \ Methods: A total of 12 sedentary men (mean \xB1 SD; age 24 \xB1 3 years) completed\
  \ three exercise sessions: a maximal incremental exercise test on a treadmill (MAX)\
  \ followed by two experiment conditions, (1) free-paced cycling HIIT on a bicycle\
  \ ergometer (HIITCYC) and (2) constant-paced running HIIT on a treadmill ergometer\
  \ (HIITRUN). Deoxygenated haemoglobin (HHb) in the gastrocnemius (GN), the left\
  \ vastus lateralis (LVL) and the right vastus lateralis (RVL) muscles, oxygen consumption\
  \ (VO2), heart rate (HR), ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and physical activity\
  \ enjoyment (PACES) were measured during HIITCYC and HIITRUN. Results: There was\
  \ a higher HHb in the LVL (p = 0.001) and RVL (p = 0.002) sites and a higher VO2\
  \ (p = 0.017) and HR (p < 0.001) during HIITCYC, compared to HIITRUN. RPE was higher\
  \ (p < 0.001) and PACES lower (p = 0.032) during HIITCYC compared to HIITRUN. Discussion:\
  \ In sedentary individuals, free-paced cycling HIIT produces higher levels of physiological\
  \ stress when compared to constant-paced running HIIT. Participants perceived running\
  \ HIIT to be more enjoyable than cycling HIIT. These findings have implications\
  \ for selection of mode of HIIT for physical stress, exercise enjoyment and compliance."
