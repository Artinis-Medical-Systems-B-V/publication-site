abstract: "Objective: Nitrate (NO3\u2212)-rich beetroot juice (BR) is recognized as\
  \ an ergogenic supplement that improves exercise tolerance during submaximal to\
  \ maximal intensity exercise in recreational and competitive athletes. A recent\
  \ study has investigated the effectiveness of BR on exercise performance during\
  \ supramaximal intensity intermittent exercise (SIE) in Olympic-level track cyclists,\
  \ but studies conducted in elite endurance athletes are scarce. The present study\
  \ aimed to determine whether BR supplementation enhances the tolerance to SIE in\
  \ elite endurance athletes. Methods: Eleven elite endurance athletes (age: 21.7\
  \ \xB1 3.7 years, maximal oxygen uptake (Formula presented.) 71.1 \xB1 5.2 mL\u02D9\
  kg\u22121\u02D9min\u22121) performed an SIE test until exhaustion following either\
  \ a 3-day BR supplementation (340 mg/d) or a placebo (PL) supplementation (<2.5\
  \ mg/d) in a randomized, single blind, placebo-controlled, and crossover study.\
  \ The exercise test consisted of 15-second cycling exercise bouts at 170% of the\
  \ maximal aerobic power interspersed with 30-second passive recovery periods. Gas\
  \ exchange was measured during SIE tests as local muscle O2 delivery and extraction\
  \ were assessed by near infrared spectroscopy. Results: The number of repetitions\
  \ completed was not significantly different between BR (13.9 \xB1 4.0 reps) and\
  \ PL conditions (14.2 \xB1 4.5 reps). BR supplementation did not affect oxygen uptake\
  \ ((Formula presented.)) during SIE tests (BR: 3378.5 \xB1 681.8 mL\u02D9min\u2212\
  1, PL: 3466.1 \xB1 505.3 mL\u02D9min\u22121). No significant change in the areas\
  \ under curves was found for local muscle total hemoglobin (BR: 6816.9 \xB1 1463.1\
  \ arbitrary units (a.u.), PL: 6771.5 \xB1 3004.5 a.u.) and deoxygenated hemoglobin\
  \ (BR: 6619.7 \xB1 875.8 a.u., PL: 6332.7 \xB1 1336.8 a.u.) during time-matched\
  \ work + recovery periods from SIE tests following BR supplementation. Conclusions:\
  \ BR supplementation does not enhance the tolerance to SIE in elite endurance athletes\
  \ and affects neither (Formula presented.) nor local muscle O2 delivery and extraction."
