abstract: "Objective: This double-blind, cross-over study examined in drug-n\xE4ive\
  \ hypertensives the effects of a single dose of dietary nitrate (beetroot juice,\
  \ BRJ) on (a) office/ambulatory BP and arterial stiffness, (b) muscle microvascular\
  \ function, and (c) hemodynamic responses and cardiovagal baroreceptor sensitivity\
  \ (cBRS) at rest and during isometric exercise. Methods: Eighteen untreated hypertensives\
  \ (44.0\_\xB1\_2.6\_years) consumed randomly, a nitrate-rich (8.1\_mmol-BRJ nitrate\
  \ ) and a nitrate-depleted (BRJ placebo ) BRJ. Office BP and pulse wave velocity\
  \ were assessed before/after BRJ. An occlusion-reperfusion maneuver with continuous\
  \ monitoring of muscle oxygenated hemoglobin (O 2 Hb) and total hemoglobin (tHb),\
  \ via NIRS, followed. Participants performed submaximal isometric handgrip with\
  \ beat-by-beat monitoring of hemodynamics and cBRS. Ambulatory BP assessment followed.\
  \ Results: During reperfusion, following arterial occlusion, the magnitude and rate\
  \ of muscle microvascular reoxygenation (O 2 Hb) and red blood cell content (tHb)\
  \ were higher in BRJ nitrate vs BRJ placebo (P\_<\_0.05), suggesting improved microvascular\
  \ reactivity. Office/ambulatory BP were lower following BRJ nitrate vs BRJ placebo\
  \ (P\_<\_0.05); pulse-wave-velocity was not altered. During isometric handgrip,\
  \ BP and peripheral resistance rise were smaller in BRJ nitrate vs BRJ placebo (P\_\
  <\_0.01-0.05), with no differences in cBRS. Conclusions: In drug-na\xEFve hypertensives,\
  \ a single dose of BRJ induces (a) short-term reductions in resting/ambulatory BP,\
  \ (b) acute improvements in muscle microvascular function, and (c) attenuation in\
  \ BP and peripheral resistance responses during isometric exercise."
