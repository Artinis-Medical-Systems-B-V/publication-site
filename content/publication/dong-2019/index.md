abstract: Wireless wearable functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has attracted
  growing attention as a candidate for real-life brain monitoring systems. It is important
  to determine the onsets at which neuronal activation is evoked by cognitive status
  in real-time analysis. We propose a machine learning approach for the classification
  of cognitive event onsets (CogEOs) in hemodynamic signals during three cognitive
  tasks. The approach does not require a threshold to be set or additional measurement
  for the rest state. A support vector machine is trained by labeled features obtained
  from the mean amplitude of hemodynamic changes and then predicts the type of onset
  points. The problems caused by the imbalance between CogEOs and non-event onsets
  (NonEO) are solved by oversampling the feature samples labeled by cognitive events.
  By oversampling, the classification accuracy from an average of five classification
  scores reaches 74%, 77%, and 75% for the simple arithmetic, 1-back, and 2-back tasks.
  We achieve the best onset classification performance when the NonEOs are randomly
  distributed and when the subject is performing the 1-back task. Our study extends
  fNIRS to real-life applications by detecting the time point when brain activation
  starts among random observations using machine learning without additional triggers
  or threshold.
