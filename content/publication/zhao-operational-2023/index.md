abstract: 'The Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD 2019 Diseases and Injuries Collaborators)
  found that diabetes significantly increases the overall burden of disease, leading
  to a 24.4% increase in disability-adjusted life years. Persistently high glucose
  levels in diabetes can cause structural and functional changes in proteins throughout
  the body, and the accumulation of protein aggregates in the brain that can be associated
  with the progression of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD). To address this burden in type
  2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a combined aerobic and resistance exercise program was
  developed based on the recommendations of the American College of Sports Medicine.
  The prospectively registered clinical trials (NCT04626453, NCT04812288) involved
  two groups: an Intervention group of older sedentary adults with T2DM and a Control
  group of healthy older adults who could be either active or sedentary. The completion
  rate for the 2-month exercise program was high, with participants completing on
  an average of 89.14% of the exercise sessions. This indicated that the program was
  practical, feasible, and well tolerated, even during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was
  also safe, requiring minimal equipment and no supervision. Our paper presents portable
  near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) based measures that showed muscle oxygen saturation
  (SmO2), i.e., the balance between oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption in muscle,
  drop during bilateral heel rise task (BHR) and the 6 min walk task (6MWT) significantly
  (p textless 0.05) changed at the post-intervention follow-up from the pre-intervention
  baseline in the T2DM Intervention group participants. Moreover, post-intervention
  changes from pre-intervention baseline for the prefrontal activation (both oxyhemoglobin
  and deoxyhemoglobin) showed statistically significant (p textless 0.05, q textless
  0.05) effect at the right superior frontal gyrus, dorsolateral, during the Mini-Cog
  task. Here, operational modal analysis provided further insights into the 2-month
  exercise intervention effects on the very-low-frequency oscillations (textless0.05
  Hz) during the Mini-Cog task that improved post-intervention in the sedentary T2DM
  Intervention group from their pre-intervention baseline when compared to active
  healthy Control group. Then, the 6MWT distance significantly (p textless 0.01) improved
  in the T2DM Intervention group at post-intervention follow-up from pre-intervention
  baseline that showed improved aerobic capacity and endurance. Our portable NIRS
  based measures have practical implications at the point of care for the therapists
  as they can monitor muscle and brain oxygenation changes during physical and cognitive
  tests to prescribe personalized physical exercise doses without triggering individual
  stress response, thereby, enhancing vascular health in T2DM.'
