abstract: 'Intermittent claudication (IC) is characterized by decreased blood flow
  and oxygen delivery to the lower-limb muscles, resulting in pain and impaired functional
  capacity. This study evaluated the effects of a 12-week hybrid walking intervention
  on muscle oxygenation and functional capacity in 38 patients with IC (Rutherford
  I-III). Functional capacity was evaluated by means of two different treadmill test
  protocols and a six-minute walk test (6MWT). Muscle oxygenation was assessed during
  the treadmill tests using near-infrared spectroscopy. After the intervention, maximal
  walking distance was significantly increased (p textless 0.001) during the progressive
  maximal treadmill test (mean (SD): +155 (SD 177) metres) and 6MWT (+18 (SD 29) metres)
  metres, with concomitant improvements in muscle oxygenation measures. Deoxygenation
  was slower during the progressive maximal test (p textless 0.001) and reoxygenation
  was faster during recovery (p = 0.045). During the more submaximal test, oxygenated
  haemoglobin was better preserved (p = 0.040). Slower deoxygenation was more pronounced
  in the high responders of the progressive maximal treadmill test (p = 0.002). The
  findings suggest that preserved oxygen availability and slower deoxygenation during
  exercise could partly explain the improvements in functional capacity.'
