abstract: "Background: In patients with obstructive lung disease, maintaining adequate\
  \ ventilation during exercise may require greater contraction of the respiratory\
  \ muscles, which may lead to a compression of muscle capillaries. Furthermore, dynamic\
  \ hyperinflation (DH) is frequent during exercise in these patients, as it allows\
  \ to reach higher expiratory flows and to satisfy respiratory demand. However, in\
  \ such situation, intercostal muscles are likely to be stretched, which could affect\
  \ the diameter of their capillaries. Thus, in a context of high level of expiratory\
  \ resistance, intercostal muscle oxygenation may be disturbed during exercise, especially\
  \ if DH occurs.Methods: Twelve participants (22\xB12 years) performed two sessions\
  \ of moderate exercise (20 min) by breathing freely with and without a 20-cmH2O\
  \ expiratory threshold load (ETL). Tissue saturation index (TSI) and concentration\
  \ changes from rest (\u2206) in oxygenated ([O2Hb]) and total haemoglobin ([tHb])\
  \ were measured in the seventh intercostal space using near-infrared spectroscopy.\
  \ Respiratory, metabolic and cardiac variables were likewise recorded.Results:\_\
  Throughout exercise, dyspnea was higher and TSI was lower in ETL condition than\
  \ in control (p<0.01). After a few minutes of exercise, \u2206 [O2Hb] was also lower\
  \ in ETL condition, as well as \u2206 [tHb], when inspiratory capacity started to\
  \ be reduced (p<0.05). Changes in [O2Hb] and dyspnea were correlated with changes\
  \ in expiratory flow rate (Vt/Te) (r = -0.66 and 0.66. respectively; p<0.05).Conclusion:\
  \ During exercise with ETL, impaired muscle oxygenation could be due to a limited\
  \ increase in blood volume resulting from strong muscle contraction and/or occurrence\
  \ of DH."
