abstract: Pleasant touch is a form of tactile stimulation mediated by tactile C afferent
  fibres. It involves the encoding of the emotional value associated with tactile
  stimulation and subserves important social functions. Although pleasant touch has
  gathered increased interest in recent years, no protocol has been proposed to assess
  it with a robust and reliable method. In the present study we adopted a rigorous
  protocol for evaluating the pleasantness or unpleasantness of 9 tactile (pleasant,
  unpleasant, or neutral) stimuli delivered on eight body areas in healthy individuals.
  We recorded participants' ratings on pleasantness and intensity of the stimulus,
  as well as their activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) by functional near-infrared
  spectroscopy (fNIRS). A questionnaire evaluated participantsâ€™ subjective experience
  of touch in everyday life. The behavioural results confirmed the effectiveness of
  the protocol as the stimuli selected to evoke pleasantness were perceived as significantly
  more pleasant than unpleasant and neutral ones, whereas unpleasant stimuli were
  perceived as more intense than all other stimuli. The participants reported the
  palm of the hand, particularly the left one, as the most sensitive area to tactile
  stimulation. Judgements of pleasantness were positively correlated with subjective
  experience of touch in everyday life. fNIRS data showed increased activity in the
  prefrontal cortex particularly during stimulation with pleasant and unpleasant stimuli,
  consistent with behavioural findings. Overall, this study contributes to understand
  the processing of pleasant touch and its neural correlates, while introducing a
  rigorous protocol for investigating tactile stimulation. This protocol holds promise
  for future utilisation in both healthy and clinical populations.
