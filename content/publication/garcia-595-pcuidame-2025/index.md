abstract: 'CuidAME, the Spanish national registry for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA),
  was created in 2020 to collect real-life data after the arrival of innovative therapies:
  Nusinersen (Ns, available in Spain since 2018), gene therapy Onasemnogene abeparvovec
  (GT, 2021) and Risdiplam (Rs, 2022). It includes all genetically confirmed SMA patients,
  despite their treatment, followed up in several Spanish hospitals (target population
  estimated at 1000 patients, followed at least for five years). The objective is
  to describe the characteristics of the SMA population in Spain. Observational registry
  that collects retrospective and prospective data: epidemiology, natural history,
  effect of treatments and impact of the disease. 543 patients (23 children, 270 adults)
  from 25 centers (2.4% deceased and 1.3% were lost of follow-up). SMA type distribution
  is: 23% SMA1, 35% SMA2, 38% SMA3, textless1% SMA4. Twelve patients (2%) were diagnosed
  presymptomatically (7 had 2SMN2 and 5 had 3SMN2). 495 patients (91%) received a
  disease-modifying therapy (DMT) during the follow-up: Ns 242 (45%), Rs 102 (19%)
  and GT 29 (5%). 17% received multiple treatments: 79 switches from Ns to Rs, and
  13 AME1 children received both GT and Ns (except two). Six presymptomatic patients
  were treated with GT, four with Ns, two with Rs (median age at treatment: 46 days
  of life, current median age: 2.2 y.o). CuidAME is currently the platform containing
  Spanish largest, harmonized, and standardized SMA clinical lead database. The estimated
  population has already been recruited and is expected to increase due to the inclusion
  of new centers. It provides crucial data, allowing a better understanding of the
  disease, the efficacy and the adverse effects of innovative therapies. National
  and international collaborations among centers and registries are promoted, expanding
  SMA knowledge.'
