abstract: "New Findings: What is the central question of this study? Continuous-wave\
  \ near-infrared spectroscopy, coupled with venous and arterial occlusions, offers\
  \ an economical, non-invasive alternative to measuring skeletal muscle blood flow\
  \ and oxygen consumption, but its reliability during exercise has not been established.\
  \ What is the main finding and its importance? Continuous-wave near-infrared spectroscopy\
  \ devices can reliably assess local skeletal muscle blood flow and oxygen consumption\
  \ from the vastus lateralis in healthy, physically active adults. The patterns of\
  \ response exhibited during exercise of varying intensity agree with other published\
  \ results using similar methodologies, meriting potential applications in clinical\
  \ diagnosis and therapeutic assessment. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), coupled\
  \ with rapid venous and arterial occlusions, can be used for the non-invasive estimation\
  \ of resting local skeletal muscle blood flow (mBF) and oxygen consumption (m V02),\
  \ respectively. However, the day-to-day reliability of mBF and m V02 responses to\
  \ stressors such as incremental dynamic exercise has not been established. The aim\
  \ of this study was to determine the reliability of NIRS-derived mBF and V02 responses\
  \ from incremental dynamic exercise. Measurements of mBF and V02 were collected\
  \ in the vastus lateralis of 12 healthy, physically active adults [seven men and\
  \ five women; 25 (SD 6)\_years old] during three non-consecutive visits within 10\_\
  days. After 10\_min rest, participants performed 3\_min of rhythmic isotonic knee\
  \ extension (one extension every 4\_s) at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30% of maximal voluntary\
  \ contraction (MVC), before four venous occlusions and then two arterial occlusions.\
  \ The mBF and (m V02) increased proportionally with intensity [from 0.55 to 7.68\_\
  ml\_min\u22121\_(100\_ml)\u22121 and from 0.05 to 1.86\_ml\_O2\_min\u22121\_(100\_\
  g)\u22121, respectively] up to 25% MVC, where they began to plateau at 30% MVC.\
  \ Moreover, an mBF/ m V02 muscle oxygen consumption ratio of \u223C5 was consistent\
  \ for all exercise stages. The intraclass correlation coefficient for mBF indicated\
  \ high to very high reliability for 10\u201330% MVC (0.82\u20130.9). There was very\
  \ high reliability for V02 across all exercise stages (intraclass correlation coefficient\
  \ 0.91\u20130.96). In conclusion, NIRS can reliably assess muscle blood flow and\
  \ oxygen consumption responses to low- to moderate-intensity exercise, meriting\
  \ potential applications in clinical diagnosis and therapeutic assessment."
