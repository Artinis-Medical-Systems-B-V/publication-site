abstract: "Noninvasive and accurate assessment of driving fatigue in relation to brain\
  \ activity during long-term driving can contribute to traffic safety and accident\
  \ prevention. This study evaluated functional connectivity (FC) in relevant brain\
  \ regions. Synergistic mechanisms in different brain regions were detected by a\
  \ novel simulator, which combined semi-immersive virtual reality technology and\
  \ functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Each subject was instructed to complete\
  \ driving tasks coupled with a mental calculation task. Wavelet coherence (WCO)\
  \ and wavelet phase coherence (WPCO) were calculated and assessed in frequency intervals\
  \ (I) 0.6\u20132 and (II) 0.145\u20130.6\_Hz as global connectivity measures; (III)\
  \ 0.052\u20130.145, (IV) 0.021\u20130.052, (V) 0.0095\u20130.021 and (VI) 0.005\u2013\
  0.0095\_Hz as FC. WCO and WPCO revealed the strength and synchronization of cerebral\
  \ connectivity, respectively. Significantly low WCO levels were found in intervals\
  \ I and III in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and IV in motor cortex (MC) at the end of\
  \ the driving task. Furthermore, significantly low WPCO were found in intervals\
  \ I, and III in PFC and interval IV in MC. Experimental findings suggested that\
  \ progressive mental fatigue adversely influences the cognitive function in the\
  \ PFC and the cooperative mechanism between the PFC and MC."
