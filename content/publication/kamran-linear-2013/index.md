abstract: "Objective. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an emerging\
  \ non-invasive brain imaging technique that measures brain activities by using near-infrared\
  \ light of 650-950 nm wavelength. The major advantages of fNIRS are its low cost,\
  \ portability, and good temporal resolution as a plausible solution to real-time\
  \ imaging. Recent research has shown the great potential of fNIRS as a tool for\
  \ brain-computer interfaces. Approach. This paper presents the first novel technique\
  \ for fNIRS-based modelling of brain activities using the linear parameter-varying\
  \ (LPV) method and adaptive signal processing. The output signal of each channel\
  \ is assumed to be an output of an LPV system with unknown coefficients that are\
  \ optimally estimated by the affine projection algorithm. The parameter vector is\
  \ assumed to be Gaussian. Main results. The general linear model (GLM) is very popular\
  \ and is a commonly used method for the analysis of functional MRI data, but it\
  \ has certain limitations in the case of optical signals. The proposed model is\
  \ more efficient in the sense that it allows the user to define more states. Moreover,\
  \ unlike most previous models, it is online. The present results, showing improvement,\
  \ were verified by random finger-tapping tasks in extensive experiments. We used\
  \ 24 states, which can be reduced or increased depending on the cost of computation\
  \ and requirements. Significance. The t-statistics were employed to determine the\
  \ activation maps and to verify the significance of the results. Comparison of the\
  \ proposed technique and two existing GLM-based algorithms shows an improvement\
  \ in the estimation of haemodynamic response. Additionally, the convergence of the\
  \ proposed algorithm is shown by error reduction in consecutive iterations. \xA9\
