abstract: "Background We analyze the effects of graduated compression stoking (GCS)\
  \ on walking capacity and oxygen saturation in intermittent claudication (IC) patients.\
  \ Methods Eighteen patients with IC performed the 6-minute walking test in 2 conditions\
  \ in random order: GCS or placebo sock. Onset claudication distance and total walking\
  \ distance were obtained. The calf muscle oxygen saturation was continuously monitored\
  \ before, during, and after 6-minute walk test. Comparisons of the walking capacity\
  \ and StO2 parameters between GCS and placebo conditions were analyzed by Wilcoxon\
  \ rank-sum test. Results The onset claudication distance (GCS: 120\_\xB1\_99\_meters\
  \ vs. placebo: 150\_\xB1\_126\_meters; P\_=\_0.798) and total walking distance (GCS:\
  \ 330\_\xB1\_108\_meters vs. placebo: 324\_\xB1\_60\_meters; P\_=\_0.130) were similar\
  \ between conditions. There were no differences in StO2 parameters between conditions\
  \ (P\_>\_0.05). Conclusions GCS does not decrease walking performance and calf muscle\
  \ oxygenation saturation during 6-minute walk test in patients with IC."
