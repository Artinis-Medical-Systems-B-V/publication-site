abstract: Abstract  Background Over 55 million adults are living with dementia globally,
  which is projected to reach 157 million by 2050. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI),
  a syndrome of memory impairment with intact activities of daily living, may precede
  dementia by several years. Around 5–15% of individuals with MCI convert to dementia
  annually. Novel treatments which delay progression of MCI to dementia are urgently
  needed. Transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation (tVNS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation
  technique that targets the vagus nerve. Importantly, tVNS has been shown to improve
  cognition in healthy volunteers, but has not been extensively examined as a potential
  therapeutic approach in MCI. VINCI-AD will examine the safety and feasibility of
  tVNS in older adults with MCI.   Design VINCI-AD is an investigator-led, single-site,
  single-blind, sham-controlled crossover pilot study which aims to assess the safety
  and feasibility of tVNS in 40 participants with amnestic MCI. All participants will
  attend for three consecutive study visits during which they will be randomised to
  receive no stimulation (baseline), active tVNS stimulation (stimulation at cymba
  conchae of left ear) or sham tVNS stimulation (at earlobe). Safety will be primarily
  assessed by ascertainment of adverse events. Further safety assessment will examine
  the impact of acute tVNS on subjective (orthostatic symptoms), peripheral (finometry-based
  blood pressure) and central (assessed via Near Infrared Spectroscopy [NIRS]) haemodynamic
  responses to active stand. Feasibility will be determined using a custom-designed
  occupational assessment of device usability. Exploratory secondary analysis in VINCI-AD
  will examine the potential impact of acute tVNS on associative memory, spatial memory
  and inhibitory control to inform sample size estimates for future trials of tVNS
  in older adults with MCI.   Discussion VINCI-AD will report on the safety (adverse
  events/haemodynamic responses to active stand) and feasibility of tVNS as a potential
  therapeutic option in MCI. Detailed reporting of study eligibility and completion
  rates will be reported. Exploratory analysis will examine the potential cognitive
  benefits of acute tVNS on cognitive function in MCI to report potential effect sizes
  that may inform future clinical trials in this cohort.   Trial registration  https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05514756
