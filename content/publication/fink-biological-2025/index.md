abstract: Suicide attempts (SA) are a common risk in adolescents with non-suicidal
  self-injury (NSSI). In the present study, we investigated whether a set of biological
  markers contributed (above clinical features) to the distinction of adolescents
  with NSSI and SA from those with NSSI alone using machine-based learning approaches.
  Female adolescents engaging in NSSI (n = 161) were recruited from our outpatient
  clinic for risk-taking and self-harming behavior (AtR!Sk). Different machine-based
  learning models (logistic regression, elastic net regression, random forests, gradient
  boosted trees) with repeated cross-validation were applied. We tested whether a)
  the full set of neurobiological markers, b) a reduced set including preselected
  markers based on existing evidence (CRP, interleukin-6, salivary cortisol, DHEA-S,
  TSH, dopamine, norepinephrine, ACTH), and c) a model with only depressive symptoms
  and age could distinguish between the two groups (NSSI + SA vs. NSSI alone). Depressive
  symptoms and age were included as covariates in the reduced set to account for their
  potential predictive effects. The reduced set of neurobiological markers showed
  poor to fair predictive performance (AUC between 0.62 and 0.72) for SA depending
  on the model. Predictors with the highest predictive value were high DHEA-S (OR = 1.47,
  95% CI = 1.04–2.09) and low TSH (OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.48–0.97). Complex models
  slightly outperformed simpler ones and feature selection modestly increased predictive
  performance. The study may suggest a future potential of biomarkers for the assessment
  of suicide risk among adolescents with NSSI. Further research is needed to replicate
  these findings longitudinally.
