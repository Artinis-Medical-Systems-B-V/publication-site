abstract: Significance Performance during risky decision making is one of the essential
  cognitive functions that is impaired in several psychiatric disorders including
  addiction. However, the cognitive mechanism and neural correlates underlying risky
  decision making in chronic pain patients are unclear. To our knowledge, this study
  is among the first to construct computational models to detect the underlying cognitive
  process of chronic pain patients during risky decision making.  Aim This study aimed
  at inspecting the significantly abnormal risky decision-making patterns of chronic
  pain patients and its neuro-cognitive correlates.  Approach In this case-control
  study, 19 chronic pain patients and 32 healthy controls (HCs) were included to measure
  the risky decision making in a balloon analogue risk task (BART). Optical neuroimaging
  using functional near-infrared spectroscopy, together with computational modeling,
  was carried out to systematically characterize the specific impairments based on
  BART.  Results Computational modeling findings on behavioral performance demonstrated
  that the chronic pain patient group exhibited significant deficits in learning during
  BART (p textless 0.001), tending to make decisions more randomly without deliberation
  (p textless 0.01). In addition, significant brain deactivation alternation in the
  prefrontal cortex (PFC) during the task was detected for the patient group compared
  with that from the control group (p textless 0.005).  Conclusions Long-term aberrant
  pain responses significantly disrupted the PFC function and behavioral performance
  in chronic pain patients. The joint behavioral modeling and neuroimaging techniques
  open a new avenue for fully understanding the cognitive impairment and brain dysfunction
  of risky decision making associated with chronic pain.
