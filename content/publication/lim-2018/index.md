abstract: 'Technological advances in avionics systems and components have facilitated
  the introduction of progressively more integrated and automated Human-Machine Interfaces
  and Interactions (HMI2) on-board civil and military aircraft. A detailed review
  of these HMI2 evolutions is presented, addressing both manned aircraft (fixed and
  rotary wing) and Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) specificities for the most
  fundamental flight tasks: aviate, navigate, communicate and manage. Due to the large
  variability in mission requirements, greater emphasis is given to safety-critical
  displays, command and control functions as well as associated technology developments.
  Additionally, a top-level definition of RPAS mission-essential functionalities is
  provided, addressing planning and real-time decision support for single and multi-aircraft
  operations. While current displays are able to integrate and fuse information from
  several sources to perform a range of different functions, these displays have limited
  adaptability. Further development to increase HMI2 adaptiveness has significant
  potential to enhance the human operator''s effectiveness, thereby contributing to
  safer and more efficient operations. The adaptive HMI2 concepts in the literature
  contain three common elements. These elements comprise the ability to assess the
  system and environmental states; the ability to assess the operator states; and
  the ability to adapt the HMI2 according to the first two elements. While still an
  emerging area of research, HMI2 adaptation driven by human performance and cognition
  has the potential to greatly enhance human-machine teaming through varying the system
  support according to the user''s needs. However, one of the outstanding challenges
  in the design of such adaptive systems is the development of suitable models and
  algorithms to describe human performance and cognitive states based on real-time
  sensor measurements. After reviewing the state-of-research in human performance
  assessment and adaptation techniques, detailed recommendations are provided to support
  the integration of such techniques in the HMI2 of future Communications, Navigations,
  Surveillance (CNS), Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) and Avionics (CNS + A) systems.'
