abstract: "Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of active preconditioning\
  \ techniques using blood flow restriction or/and systemic hypoxic exposure on repeated\
  \ sprint cycling performance and oxygenation responses. Methods: Participants were\
  \ 17 men; 8 were cycle trained (T: 21 \xB1 6 h/week) and 9 were untrained but physically\
  \ active (UT). Each participant completed 4 cycles of 5 min stages of cycling at\
  \ 1.5 W\u22C5kg\u20131 in four conditions [Control; IPC (ischemic preconditioning)\
  \ with partial blood flow restriction (60% of relative total occlusion pressure);\
  \ HPC (hypoxic preconditioning) in normobaric systemic hypoxia (FIO2 13.6%); and\
  \ HIPC (hypoxic and ischemic preconditioning combined)]. Following a 40 min rest\
  \ period, a repeated sprint exercise (RSE: 8 \xD7 10 s sprints; 20 s of recovery)\
  \ was performed. Near-infrared spectroscopy parameters [for each sprint, change\
  \ in deoxyhemoglobin ($\u0394$[HHb]), total hemoglobin ($\u0394$[tHb]), and tissue\
  \ saturation index ($\u0394$TSI%)] were measured. Results: Trained participants\
  \ achieved higher power outputs (+10\u201316%) than UT in all conditions, yet RSE\
  \ performance did not differ between active preconditioning techniques in the two\
  \ groups. All conditions induced similar sprint decrement scores during RSE in both\
  \ T and UT (16 \xB1 2 vs. 23 \xB1 9% in CON; 17 \xB1 3 vs. 19 \xB1 6% in IPC; 18\
  \ \xB1 5 vs. 20 \xB1 10% in HPC; and 17 \xB1 3 vs. 21 \xB1 5% in HIPC, for T and\
  \ UT, respectively). During the sprints, $\u0394$[HHb] was larger after IPC than\
  \ both HPC and CON in T (p < 0.001). The $\u0394$[tHb] was greater after HPC than\
  \ all other conditions in T, whereas IPC, HPC, and HIPC induced higher $\u0394$[tHb]\
  \ than CON in UT. Conclusion: None of the active preconditioning methods had an\
  \ ergogenic effect on repeated sprint cycling performance, despite some specific\
  \ hemodynamic responses (e.g., greater oxygen extraction and changes in blood volume),\
  \ which were emphasized in the trained cyclists."
