abstract: "Methods: Out of 8 PD STN-DBS patients, we present here preliminary analysis\
  \ of a male (62y) PD patient with bilateral STN-DBS (unipolar, 180Hz, 3.5V). The\
  \ patient was tested after 12h withdrawal of dopamine medications in both an \u201C\
  OFF\u201D and \u201CON\u201D DBS session separated by 30min. The subject performed\
  \ a computerised GoNoGo task with 3 alternating Go/ NoGo blocks of 30s duration\
  \ (20 trials/block) interspersed with 30s rest. Reaction time (RT) and accuracy\
  \ (omission-Om and commission-Cm errors) results were the average of the 3 Go/NoGo\
  \ blocks. During performance of the Go/NoGo blocks, changes in oxygenated (O2Hb)\
  \ and deoxygenated (HHb) haemoglobin concentrations were measured by a fNIRS system\
  \ (Oxymon MkIII, Artinis Medical Systems) covering the bilateral PFC regions. Results/Discussion:\
  \ Clinical motor performance (UPDRSIII) improved from OFF (31) to ON (20). RT during\
  \ Go and NoGo was $backslash$textasciitilde40ms faster in OFF (460 and 364ms) than\
  \ ON (516 and 407ms). Furthermore, the NoGo condition increased misses (Om) in ON\
  \ (7%) than OFF (0%); while false alarms (Cm) were similarly increased in ON (27%)\
  \ and OFF (30%). The Go and NoGo conditions increased bilateral PFC activation (i.e.,\
  \ increase in O2Hb and decrease in HHb). However, there was a general decrease in\
  \ PFC activation in OFF relative to ON, and this was more obvious in Go than NoGo\
  \ (see Fig. 1) Conclusion: These preliminary results indicate that STN-DBS modulates\
  \ neurovascular responses in the bilateral PFC that are associated with response\
  \ inhibition."
