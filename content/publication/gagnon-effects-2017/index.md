abstract: "Skin and core tissue cooling modulates skeletal muscle oxygenation at rest.\
  \ Whether tissue cooling also influences the skeletal muscle deoxygenation response\
  \ during exercise is unclear. We evaluated the effects of skin and core tissue cooling\
  \ on skeletal muscle blood volume and deoxygenation during sustained walking and\
  \ running. Eleven male participants walked or ran six times on a treadmill for 60\_\
  min in ambient temperatures of 22\xB0C (Neutral), 0\xB0C for skin cooling (Cold\
  \ 1), and at 0\xB0C following a core and skin cooling protocol (Cold 2). Difference\
  \ between oxy/deoxygenated haemoglobin ([diffHb]: deoxygenation index) and total\
  \ haemoglobin content ([tHb]: total blood volume) in the vastus lateralis (VL) muscle\
  \ was measured continuously. During walking, lower [tHb] was observed at 1\_min\
  \ in Cold 1 and Cold 2 vs. Neutral (P\u02C20.05). Lower [diffHb] was seen at 1 and\
  \ 10\_min in Cold 2 vs. Neutral by 13.5\_\xB1\_1.2\_\xB5M and 15.3\_\xB1\_1.4\_\xB5\
  M and Cold 1 by 10.4\_\xB1\_3.1\_\xB5M and 11.1\_\xB1\_4.1\_\xB5M, respectively\
  \ (P\u02C20.05). During running, [tHb] was lower in Cold 2 vs. Neutral at 10\_min\
  \ only (P\_=\_0.004). [diffHb] was lower at 1\_min in Cold 2 by 11.3\_\xB1\_3.1\_\
  \xB5M compared to Neutral and by 13.5\_\xB1\_2.8\_\xB5M compared to Cold 1 (P\u02C2\
  0.001). Core tissue cooling, prior to exercise, induced greater deoxygenation of\
  \ the VL muscle during the early stages of exercise, irrespective of changes in\
  \ blood volume. Skin cooling alone, however, did not influence deoxygenation of\
  \ the VL during exercise."
