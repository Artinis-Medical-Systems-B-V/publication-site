abstract: Pain is a naturally occurring phenomenon that consistently inhibits exercise
  performance by imposing unconscious, neurophysiological alterations (e.g., corticospinal
  changes) as well as conscious, psychophysiological pressures (e.g., shared effort
  demands). Although, several studies indicate that pain would elicit lower task outputs
  for a set intensity of perceived effort, no study has tested this. Therefore, this
  study investigated the impact of elevated muscle pain through a hypertonic saline
  injection on the power output, psychophysiological, cerebral oxygenation, and perceptual
  changes during fixed perceived effort exercise. Ten participants completed three
  visits (one familiarisation + two fixed perceived effort trials). Fixed perceived
  effort cycling corresponded to 15% above gas exchange threshold (mean RPE = 15;
  hard). Before the 30-minute fixed perceived effort exercise, participants received
  a randomised, bilateral hypertonic or isotonic saline injection in the vastus lateralis.
  Power output, cardiorespiratory, cerebral oxygenation, and perceptual markers (e.g.,
  affective valence) were recorded during exercise. Linear mixed model regression
  assessed the condition and time effects and condition × time interactions. Significant
  condition effects showed that power output was significantly lower during hypertonic
  conditions (t_107= 2.08,p=.040,β=4.77 Watts,95%CI [0.27 to 9.26 Watts]). Meanwhile
  all physiological variables (e.g., heart rate, oxygen uptake, minute ventilation)
  demonstrated no significant condition effects. Condition effects were observed for
  deoxyhaemoglobin changes from baseline (t_107= -3.29,p=.001,β=-1.50 ΔµM,95%CI [-2.40
  to-0.61 ΔµM]) and affective valence (t_127= 6.12,p=.001,β=0.93,95%CI [0.63,1.23]).
  Results infer that pain impacts the self-regulation of fixed perceived effort exercise,
  as differences in power output mainly occurred when pain ratings were higher after
  hypertonic versus isotonic saline administration.
