abstract: 'The Tibetans’ better aerobic exercise capacity at altitude remains ill-understood.
  We tested the hypothesis that Tibetans display better muscle and brain tissue oxygenation
  during exercise in hypoxia. Using near-infrared spectrometry (NIRS) to provide indices
  of tissue oxygenation, we measured oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin ([O 2 Hb] and [HHb],
  respectively) responses of the vastus lateralis muscle and the right prefrontal
  cortex in ten Han Chinese and ten Tibetans during incremental cycling to exhaustion
  in a pressure-regulated chamber at simulated sea-level (air at 1 atm: normobaric
  normoxia) and 5,000 m (air at 0.5 atm: hypobaric hypoxia). Hypoxia reduced aerobic
  capacity by ∼22% in both groups ( d = 0.8, p &lt; 0.001 vs. normoxia), while Tibetans
  consistently outperformed their Han Chinese counterpart by ∼32% in normoxia and
  hypoxia ( d = 1.0, p = 0.008). We found cerebral [O 2 Hb] was higher in Tibetans
  at normoxic maximal effort compared Han ( p = 0.001), while muscle [O 2 Hb] was
  not different ( p = 0.240). Hypoxic exercise lowered muscle [O 2 Hb] in Tibetans
  by a greater extent than in Han (interaction effect: p &lt; 0.001 vs. normoxic exercise).
  Muscle [O 2 Hb] was lower in Tibetans when compared to Han during hypoxic exercise
  ( d = 0.9, p = 0.003), but not during normoxic exercise ( d = 0.4, p = 0.240). Muscle
  [HHb] was not different between the two groups during normoxic and hypoxic exercise
  ( p = 0.778). Compared to Han, our findings revealed a higher brain tissue oxygenation
  in Tibetans during maximal exercise in normoxia, but lower muscle tissue oxygenation
  during exercise in hypoxia. This would suggest that the Tibetans privileged oxygenation
  of the brain at the expense of that of the muscle.'
