abstract: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy(fNIRS)-based sleep staging has attracted
  considerable interest due to its portability and limited interference with sleep.
  However, few studies have systematically examined sleep indicators or formulated
  sleep staging models based on fNIRS features labelled by polysomnography(PSG). This
  study aimed to address these shortcomings and promote the application of fNIRS in
  sleep monitoring. 37 volunteers participated in our experiment, with 6-channel prefrontal
  fNIRS data and standard PSG data collected simultaneously. Sleep indicators were
  extracted from time-domain, frequency-domain, and entropy perspectives. Sleep staging
  was developed based on these indicators using human-scored PSG as reference. Our
  findings indicated deeper sleep was correlated with a decrease in amplitude of time-domain
  features, while entropy features showed a contrasting trend. The fNIRS-based sleep
  staging achieved a Cohen's kappa(κ) of 0.76±0.12, 0.72±0.09, 0.71±0.07, with accuracies
  of 94.2 ± 2.4 %, 87.8 ± 3.2 %, and 82.2 ± 4.1 %, for 2-class(Wake/Sleep), 3-class(Wake/NREM/REM),
  4-class (Wake/N1+N2/N3/REM) classifications, respectively. Sleep statistics derived
  from fNIRS closely aligned with those from PSG, with differences in sleep onset
  latency, wake after sleep onset, total wake/sleep time within 5 min and sleep efficiency
  below 3 %. The substantial agreement in both detailed (epoch-by-epoch) and comprehensive
  (total) sleep statistics with PSG suggests fNIRS is a reliable tool for long-term
  sleep monitoring in everyday settings.
