abstract: "BackgroundTranscutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) is a promising\
  \ therapeutic option for major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults. Alternative\
  \ third-line treatments for MDD in adolescents are scarce. Here we aimed to assess\
  \ the effects of acute tVNS on emotion recognition in adolescents with MDD.MethodsAdolescents\
  \ (14-17 years) with MDD (n = 33) and non-depressed controls (n = 30) received tVNS\
  \ or sham-stimulation in a cross-sectional, case-control, within-subject cross-randomized\
  \ controlled trial, while performing different tasks assessing emotion recognition.\
  \ Correct responses, response times, and errors of omission and commission on three\
  \ different computerized emotion recognition tasks were assessed as main outcomes.\
  \ Simultaneous recordings of electrocardiography and electro dermal activity, as\
  \ well as sampling of saliva for the determination of $\u03B1$-Amylase, were used\
  \ to quantify the effects on autonomic nervous system function.ResultstVNS had no\
  \ effect on the recognition of gradually or static expressed emotions but altered\
  \ response inhibition on the emotional Go/NoGo-Task. Specifically, tVNS increased\
  \ the likelihood of omitting a response toward sad target-stimuli in adolescents\
  \ with MDD, while decreasing errors (independent of the target emotion) in controls.\
  \ Effects of acute tVNS on autonomic nervous system function were found in non-depressed\
  \ controls only.ConclusionsAcute tVNS alters the recognition of briefly presented\
  \ facial expressions of negative valence in adolescents with MDD while generally\
  \ increasing emotion recognition in controls.TVNS seems to specifically alter early\
  \ visual processing of stimuli of negative emotional valence in MDD. These findings\
  \ suggest a potential therapeutic benefit of tVNS in adolescent MDD that requires\
  \ further evaluation within clinical trials."
