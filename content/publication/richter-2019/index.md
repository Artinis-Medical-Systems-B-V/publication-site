abstract: "The purpose of the present study was to extend the knowledge of functional\
  \ linkages between visual and mental load, performance, and prefrontal cortex (PFC)\
  \ activity, during forestry forwarding work. Eleven healthy participants, range\
  \ 21\u201351 years old, with a minimum of 1-year work experience, carried out the\
  \ task of loading logs along a standardized path in a machine simulator during two\
  \ counterbalanced test conditions: (i) conventional crane control, and; (ii) semi-automated\
  \ crane control. Mental load was assessed by quantification of oxygenated hemoglobin\
  \ (HbO2) concentration changes over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)\
  \ via non-invasive functional near infrared spectrometry (fNIRS). Visual, autonomic,\
  \ and motoric control variables were measured and analyzed in parallel along with\
  \ the individual level of performance. Linear Mixed Models (LMM) analysis indicated\
  \ more mental load during conventional crane work. Collectively, our data suggest\
  \ that fNIRS is a viable tool which can be used in neuroergonomic research to evaluate\
  \ physiological activity levels in PFC."
