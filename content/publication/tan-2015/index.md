abstract: 'Purpose: Resting-state functional connectivity in subjects with cerebral
  infarction (CI) was assessed using wavelet-based coherence analysis of near-infrared
  spectroscopy (NIRS) signals. Methods: Continuous recordings of NIRS signals were
  measured from the prefrontal cortex and sensorimotor cortical areas of 12 subjects
  with CI (CI group) and 16 healthy subjects (healthy group) during the resting state.
  The channels in these areas were divided into four connection types: homologous
  connectivity, frontoposterior connectivity, contralateral connectivity, and homolateral
  connectivity. Wavelet coherence (WCO) and wavelet phase coherence (WPCO) were calculated
  in six frequency intervals in each channel pair: I, 0.62 Hz; II, 0.1450.6 Hz; III,
  0.0520.145 Hz; IV, 0.0210.052 Hz; V, 0.00950.021 Hz; and VI, 0.0050.0095 Hz. Results:
  WCO in the six frequency intervals was significant for all channels in the healthy
  group. By contrast, WCO in frequency intervals IIVI showed weakened connectivity
  in the CI group, especially in terms of frontoposterior connectivity. WCO was significantly
  lower in the CI group than in the healthy group in the following connectivities
  and frequency intervals: front-posterior, IVVI (p < 0.05); homologous, IIIV (p <
  0.01); motor-contralateral, IIIV (p < 0.05); and motorhomolateral, IIIV (p < 0.05).
  WPCO in frequency intervals III (F = 5.032, p = 0.033) and IV (F = 11.95, p = 0.002)
  in frontoposterior connectivity, as well as in intervals IIIV in homologous, motor-contralateral
  and motor-homolateral connectivities were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the
  CI group than in the healthy group. However, WPCO in interval I showed significantly
  higher levels in motor-homolateral connectivity in the CI group than in the healthy
  group (F = 4.241, p = 0.049). Conclusions: The authors results suggest that CI causes
  a frequency-specific disruption in restingstate connectivity. This may be useful
  for assessing the effectiveness of functional recovery after CI.'
