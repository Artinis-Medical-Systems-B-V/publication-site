abstract: 'Menopause-related cognitive decline, often worsened by vasomotor symptoms
  (VMS), might be mitigated by high cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). Although acute
  exercise supports neurocognitive function, its effects vary by exercise and individual
  characteristics. In this study, we investigated the acute effects of isometric resistance
  exercise (IRE) and high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) on prefrontal cortex
  oxygenation and cognitive performance in postmenopausal women and examined the influence
  of VMS and CRF on these outcomes. A cross-over randomized controlled trial was conducted
  among 29 women aged 55 ± 3 years. The HIIE session included two sets of 12 × 15
  s at 100% maximal aerobic power, and the IRE session included 4 × 2 min at 30% maximal
  voluntary force. Cognitive functions were evaluated before and after sessions using
  the MEM-III story recall test (episodic memory), Stroop task (inhibitory control)
  and n-back task (working memory). Prefrontal cortex oxygenation was assessed by
  measuring oxyhaemoglobin (ΔHbO2), deoxygenated haemoglobin (ΔHHb) and total haemoglobin
  (ΔtHb) concentrations before, during and after each session. No effect of exercise
  was noted on cognitive performance. However, prefrontal cortex oxygenation increased
  during HIIE (ΔHbO2: d = 0.99, p textless 0.0001; ΔHHb: d = 0.68, p = 0.018; ΔtHb:
  d = 0.96, p = 0.001), during IRE (ΔHbO2: d = 1.2, p = 0.003) and post-HIIE (ΔHbO2
  and ΔtHb: d textgreater 1; p textless 0.0001) versus control. CRF positively modulated
  cognitive and cerebrovascular responses to IRE, whereas VMS showed no influence.
  IRE and HIIE did not improve cognitive performance in postmenopausal women, but
  increased prefrontal cortex oxygenation, with sustained effects after HIIE. CRF
  positively modulated responses, whereas VMS did not, underscoring the importance
  of maintaining high CRF to support brain health in this population.'
