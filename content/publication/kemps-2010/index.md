abstract: "CHF (chronic heart failure) is associated with a prolonged recovery of\
  \ skeletal muscle energy stores following submaximal exercise, limiting the ability\
  \ to perform repetitive daily activities. However, the pathophysiological background\
  \ of this impairment is not well established. The aim of the present study was to\
  \ investigate whether muscle metabolic recovery following submaximal exercise in\
  \ patients with CHF is limited by O2 delivery or O2 utilization. A total of 13 stable\
  \ CHF patients (New York Heart Association classes II-III) and eight healthy subjects,\
  \ matched for age and BMI (body mass index), were included. All subjects performed\
  \ repetitive submaximal dynamic single leg extensions in the supine position. Post-exercise\
  \ PCr (phosphocreatine) resynthesis was assessed by 31P-MRS (magnetic resonance\
  \ spectroscopy). NIRS (near-IR spectroscopy) was applied simultaneously, using the\
  \ rate of decrease in HHb (deoxygenated haemoglobin) as an index of post-exercise\
  \ muscle re-oxygenation. As expected, PCr recovery was slower in CHF patients than\
  \ in control subjects (time constant, 47 \xB1 10 compared with 35 \xB1 12 s respectively;\
  \ P=0.04). HHb recovery kinetics were also prolonged in CHF patients (mean response\
  \ time, 74\xB141 compared with 44\xB117 s respectively; P=0.04). In the patient\
  \ group, HHb recovery kinetics were slower than PCr recovery kinetics (P=0.02),\
  \ whereas no difference existed in the control group (P=0.32). In conclusion, prolonged\
  \ metabolic recovery in CHF patients is associated with an even slower muscle tissue\
  \ re-oxygenation, indicating a lower O2 delivery relative to metabolic demands.\
  \ Therefore we postulate that the impaired ability to perform repetitive daily activities\
  \ in these patients depends more on a reduced muscle blood flow than on limitations\
  \ in O2 utilization. \xA9 The Authors Journal compilation \xA9 2010 Biochemical\
