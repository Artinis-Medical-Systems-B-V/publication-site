abstract: 'The present study aimed to examine the impact of the level of physical
  activity on prefrontal cortex activation in older adults during single- and dual-task
  walking. Thirty physically inactive and 36 active older adults (60–85 years old)
  performed six 2-min tasks on a treadmill: two static cognitive tasks, two single-task
  walking tests, and two dual-task walking tests. Hemodynamics at the level of the
  prefrontal cortex were measured continuously using functional near-infrared spectroscopy
  to evaluate cortical activation. The perceived difficulty of the task, cognitive
  performance, and gait parameters were also measured. During the walking tasks, the
  level of prefrontal cortex activation, the perceived difficulty of the task, cognitive
  performance, and motor parameters were not significantly different between active
  and inactive older adults. This unchanged activation with physical activity was
  likely the consequence of a similar motor and cognitive load and cardiorespiratory
  fitness in both active and inactive older adults.'
