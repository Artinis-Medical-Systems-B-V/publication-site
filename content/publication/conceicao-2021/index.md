abstract: "Background. Since people with Parkinson disease (PD) rely on limited prefrontal\
  \ executive resources for the control of gait, interventions targeting the prefrontal\
  \ cortex (PFC) may help in managing PD-related gait impairments. Transcranial direct\
  \ current stimulation (tDCS) can be used to modulate PFC excitability and improve\
  \ prefrontal cognitive functions and gait. Objective. We investigated the effects\
  \ of adding anodal tDCS applied over the PFC to a session of aerobic exercise on\
  \ gait, cognition, and PFC activity while walking in people with PD. Methods. A\
  \ total of 20 people with PD participated in this randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled\
  \ crossover study. Participants attended two 30-minute sessions of aerobic exercise\
  \ (cycling at moderate intensity) combined with different tDCS conditions (active-\
  \ or sham- tDCS), 1 week apart. The order of sessions was counterbalanced across\
  \ the sample. Anodal tDCS (2 mA for 20 minutes [active-tDCS] or 10 s [sham-tDCS])\
  \ targeted the PFC in the most affected hemisphere. Spatiotemporal gait parameters,\
  \ cognitive functions, and PFC activity while walking were assessed before and immediately\
  \ after each session. Results. Compared with the pre-assessment, participants decreased\
  \ step time variability (effect size: \u22120.4), shortened simple and choice reaction\
  \ times (effect sizes: \u22120.73 and \u22120.57, respectively), and increased PFC\
  \ activity in the stimulated hemisphere while walking (effect size: 0.54) only after\
  \ aerobic exercise + active-tDCS. Conclusion. The addition of anodal tDCS over the\
  \ PFC to a session of aerobic exercise led to immediate positive effects on gait\
  \ variability, processing speed, and executive control of walking in people with\
  \ PD."
