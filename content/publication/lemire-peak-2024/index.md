abstract: 'Background: The aim of this study is to explore the effect of treadmill
  slope on ground reaction forces and local muscle oxygenation as putative limiting
  factors of peak oxygen uptake in graded maximal incremental running tests. Thirteen
  trained male runners completed five maximal incremental running tests on treadmill
  at − 15%, − 7.5%, 0%, 7.5% and 15% slopes while cardiorespiratory and local muscle
  oxygenation responses as well as ground reaction forces were continuously recorded.
  Blood lactate concentration and isometric knee extensor torque were measured before
  and after each test. Results: Peak oxygen uptake was lower at − 15% slope compared
  to all other conditions (from − 10 to − 17% lower, p textless 0.001), with no difference
  between − 7.5 and + 15% slope. Maximal heart rate and ventilation values were reached
  in all conditions. The negative external mechanical work increased from steep uphill
  to steep downhill slopes (from 6 to 92% of total external work) but was not correlated
  with the peak oxygen uptake reduction. Local muscle oxygenation remained higher
  in − 15% slope compared to level running (p = 0.003). Conclusions: Similar peak
  oxygen uptake can be reached in downhill running up to − 7.5% slope. At more severe
  downhill slopes (i.e., − 15%), greater negative muscle work and limited local muscle
  deoxygenation occurred, even in subjects familiarized to downhill running, presumably
  preventing the achievement of similar to other condition’s peak oxygen uptake. Key
  Points: Trained male runners can reach like level running V̇O2peak at moderate but
  not at severe negative slope. Negative external mechanical work increases with increasing
  negative slope. At maximal intensity Vastus Lateralis muscle oxygenation is higher
  in steep negative slope. Knee extensor isometric muscle torque is preserved after
  maximal level and uphill running, but reduced after downhill running, despite lower
  blood lactate. Progressive reduction of V̇O2 at maximal effort with increasing negative
  slope might be related to the metabolic consequences of increased lower limb negative
  external work (i.e., eccentric muscle actions).'
