abstract: 'Previous research has highlighted the involvement of frontal regions in
  human participants while they engaged in the explicit decoding, such as categorization
  (A vs B) and discrimination (A vs non-A), of affective signals. Given its adaptive
  value and deep evolutionary history, this human capacity to recognize the affective
  content in human calls is likely to extend to the vocalizations of other closely
  related species, such as non-human primates. However, few comparative studies have
  thus far investigated this process at both the behavioral and neural levels. Here,
  we aimed to study the role of frontal regions in human participants while they engaged
  in the explicit affective content decoding of primate calls using functional Near
  Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Specifically, we recorded frontal regions of participants
  while they categorized or discriminated positive and negatively valenced vocal signals
  produced by four different primates: humans, chimpanzee and bonobo (both great apes
  species), and rhesus macaques (a more distant species). We also analyzed whether
  behavioral responses correlated with recorded frontal activations. fNIRS data revealed
  more activations within the inferior frontal cortex pars triangularis (IFCtri),
  the frontopolar (FPC), and middle frontal cortices (MFC) during discrimination compared
  with categorization. Activity in these regions was modulated by both the species
  and the type of task, with greater activity during the discrimination of agonistic
  chimpanzee calls compared with categorization. Categorization was itself characterized
  by a decrease of frontal activity during the correct recognition of all chimpanzee
  calls, and of affiliative rhesus macaque and agonistic bonobo vocalizations. Our
  results also highlighted behavioral differences related to the type of task. Participants
  discriminated almost all affective cues of all four species vocalizations above
  chance level. In comparison, they correctly categorized the affective content of
  most human and great ape vocalizations above chance level, but not those of rhesus
  macaque calls, highlighting an effect of both phylogenetic relatedness and the type
  of task. Overall, these findings support the hypothesis of an evolutionary ancient
  affective recognition processing system situated in the frontal cortex, inherited
  from our last common ancestor with other great apes.'
