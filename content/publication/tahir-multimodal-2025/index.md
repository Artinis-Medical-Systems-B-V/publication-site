abstract: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a complex mood disorder characterized by recurrent
  depressive and manic/hypomanic episodes, accompanied by significant cognitive dysfunction
  and emotional dysregulation. Accurate and timely diagnosis, especially the differentiation
  between subtypes, remains a challenge due to overlapping symptoms, variable onset
  times for more specific symptoms (e.g., psychotic features), and the reliance on
  subjective assessments. This study examines the use of a multimodal approach combining
  electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to
  identify patterns of BD emotional dysregulation, aiming to enhance its diagnosis
  and subtype differentiation. The protocol employed an emotional visual task to evaluate
  the interference of emotional content on cognitive function. EEG data were collected
  using a whole-head cap, while fNIRS focused on hemodynamic changes in the frontal
  cortex. Furthermore, the feasibility of using a potential simplified, portable EEG-fNIRS
  system was explored by focusing the analysis on frontal regions. The cohort included
  BD patients [BP] of two main subtypes, and healthy controls [HC]. Behavioral analysis
  revealed significant performance differences between BP and HC groups. While EEG
  alone enabled groups’ classification, integrating EEG and fNIRS improved accuracy
  by reducing misclassification rates. Although classification using only frontal
  EEG regions was slightly less accurate than the full-head cap, fNIRS integration
  ensured robust results, supporting the feasibility for a potential simplified system.
  These findings underscore the complementary strengths of EEG and fNIRS in capturing
  neural and vascular markers of emotional dysregulation in BD and support the development
  of multimodal diagnostic tools for BD.
