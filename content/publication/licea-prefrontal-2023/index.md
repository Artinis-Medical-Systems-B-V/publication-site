abstract: Abstract Children with cerebral palsy (CP) exhibit impaired motor control
  and significant muscle weakness due to a brain lesion. However, studies that assess
  the relationship between brain activity and performance on dynamic functional muscle
  strength assessments in CP are needed. The aim of this study was to determine the
  effect of a progressive lateral step‐up test on prefrontal cortex (PFC) hemodynamic
  activity in children with CP. Fourteen ambulatory children with spastic CP (Gross
  Motor Function Classification System level I; 5–11 y) and 14 age‐ and sex‐matched
  typically developing control children completed a progressive lateral step‐up test
  at incremental step heights (0, 10, 15 and 20 cm) using their non‐dominant lower
  limb. Hemodynamic activity in the PFC was assessed using non‐invasive, portable
  functional neuroimaging (functional near‐infrared spectroscopy). Children with CP
  completed fewer repetitions at each step height and exhibited lower PFC hemodynamic
  activity across step heights compared to controls. Lower PFC activation in CP was
  maintained after statistically controlling for the number of repetitions completed
  at each step height. PFC hemodynamic activity was not associated with LSUT task
  performance in children with CP, but a positive relationship was observed in controls
  at the most challenging 20 cm step height. The results suggest there is an altered
  PFC recruitment pattern in children with CP during a highly dynamic test of functional
  strength. Further studies are needed to explore the mechanisms underlying the suppressed
  PFC activation observed in children with CP compared to typically developing children.
