abstract: "Purpose: It has been shown that an inspiratory muscle warm-up (IMW) could\
  \ enhance performance. IMW may also improve the near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-derived\
  \ tissue oxygen saturation index (TSI) during cycling. However, there exists contradictory\
  \ data about the effect of this conditioning strategy on performance and muscle\
  \ oxygenation. We examined the effect of IMW on speed skating performance and studied\
  \ the underpinning physiological mechanisms related to muscle oxygenation. Methods:\
  \ In a crossover, randomized, single-blind study, eight elite speed skaters performed\
  \ 3000\_m on-ice time trials, preceded by either IMW (2 \xD7 30 breaths, 40% maximal\
  \ inspiratory pressure) or SHAM (2 \xD7 30 breaths, 15% maximal inspiratory pressure).\
  \ Changes in TSI, oxyhemoglobin\u2013oxymyoglobin ([O 2 HbMb]), deoxyhemoglobin\u2013\
  deoxymyoglobin ([HHbMb]), total hemoglobin\u2013myoglobin ([THbMb]) and HHbMbdiff\
  \ ([O 2 HbMb]\u2013[HHbMb]) in the right vastus lateralis muscle were monitored\
  \ by NIRS. All variables were compared at different time points of the race simulation\
  \ with repeated-measures analysis of variance. Differences between IMW and SHAM\
  \ were also analyzed using Cohen's effect size (ES) \xB1 90% confidence limits,\
  \ and magnitude-based inferences. Results: Compared with SHAM, IMW had no clear\
  \ impact on skating time (IMW 262.88 \xB1 17.62\_s vs. SHAM 264.05 \xB1 21.12\_\
  s, effect size (ES) 0.05; 90% confidence limits, \u2212 0.22, 0.32, p = 0.7366),\
  \ TSI, HbMbdiff, [THbMb], [O 2 HbMb] and perceptual responses. Conclusions: IMW\
  \ did not modify skating time during a 3000\_m time trial in speed skaters, in the\
  \ conditions of our study. The unchanged [THbMb] and TSI demonstrate that the mechanisms\
  \ by which IMW could possibly exert an effect on performance were unaffected by\
  \ this intervention."
