abstract: Upright posture challenges the cerebrovascular system, leading to changes
  in middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAv) dynamics which are less evident at supine
  rest. Chronic alterations in MCAv have been linked to hypoperfusion states and the
  effect that this may have on cognition remains unclear. This study aimed to determine
  if MCAv and oscillatory metrics of MCAv (ex. pulsatility index, PI) during upright
  posture are i) associated with cognitive function and gait speed (GS) to a greater
  extent than during supine rest, and ii) are different between sexes.  Beat-by-beat
  MCAv (transcranial Doppler ultrasound) and mean arterial pressure (MAP, plethysmography)
  were averaged for 30-seconds during supine-rest through a transition to standing
  for 53 participants (73Â±6yrs, 17 females). While controlling for age, multiple linear
  regressions predicting MoCA scores and GS from age, supine MCAv metrics, and standing
  MCAv metrics, were completed. Simple linear regressions predicting Montreal Cognitive
  Assessment (MoCA) score and GS from MCAv metrics were performed separately for females
  and males. Significance was set to ptextless0.05.  Lower standing diastolic MCAv
  was a significant (p = 0.017) predictor of lower MoCA scores in participants with
  mild cognitive impairment, and this relationship only remained significant for males.
  Lower standing PI was associated with slower GS (p = 0.027, r=-0.306) in both sexes.
  Our results indicate a relationship between blunted MCAv and altered oscillatory
  flow profiles during standing, with lower MoCA scores and GS. These relationships
  were not observed in the supine position, indicating a unique relationship between
  standing measures of MCAv with cognitive and physical functions.
