abstract: "The organisation of language in the brain of multilingual people remains\
  \ controversial. Using a high temporal resolution 12-channel near-infrared continuous\
  \ wave spectroscopy system, we have demonstrated that it is possible to monitor\
  \ non-invasively, comfortably and, without the interferences due to intrinsic limitations\
  \ of positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging\
  \ (fMRI), cortical oxygenation changes in the Broca's area in response to translation\
  \ of short sentences and language switching. Eight Dutch students proficient in\
  \ English translated aloud from their native language into English or vice versa\
  \ or alternating (switching) short visually presented sentences. These tasks provoked,\
  \ in the left inferior frontal cortex which includes the Broca's area, a consistent\
  \ and incremental rise in oxyhaemoglobin accompanied by a smaller decrease in deoxyhaemoglobin.\
  \ The investigated cortical areas surrounding the Broca's area showed no uniform\
  \ and consistent oxygenation changes upon the three different translation tasks.\
  \ These results confirm that Broca's area is involved in the translation process\
  \ and its so called activation is unaffected by the direction of the translation.\
  \ In addition, these results strengthen the role of near-infrared multi-point measurements\
  \ as a powerful tool for investigating the spatial and temporal features of the\
  \ cortical oxygenation changes during language processing. \xA9 2002 Elsevier Science\
