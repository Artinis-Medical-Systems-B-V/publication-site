abstract: 'Early childhood marks a pivotal period in the maturation of executive function,
  the cognitive ability to consciously regulate actions and thoughts. Mindfulness-based
  interventions have shown promise in bolstering executive function in children. This
  study used the functional near-infrared spectroscopy technique to explore the impact
  of mindfulness-based training on young children. Brain imaging data were collected
  from 68 children (41 boys, aged 61.8 ± 10.7 months) who were randomly assigned to
  either an intervention group (N = 37, aged 60.03 ± 11.14 months) or a control group
  (N = 31, aged 59.99 ± 10.89 months). Multivariate and multiscale sample entropy
  analyses were used. The results showed that: (1) brain complexity was reduced in
  the intervention group after receiving the mindfulness-based intervention in all
  three executive function tasks (ps &lt; 0.05), indicating a more efficient neural
  processing mechanism after the intervention; (2) difference comparisons between
  the intervention and control groups showed significant differences in relevant brain
  regions during cognitive shifting (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and medial
  prefrontal cortex) and working memory tasks (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex),
  which corroborates with improved behavioral results in the intervention group (Z = −3.674,
  P &lt; 0.001 for cognitive shifting; Z = 2.594, P &lt; 0.01 for working memory).
  These findings improve our understanding of early brain development in young children
  and highlight the neural mechanisms by which mindfulness-based interventions affect
  executive function. Implications for early intervention to promote young children’s
  brain development are also addressed.'
