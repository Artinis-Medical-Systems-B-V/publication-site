abstract: "Background Deficits in cognitive domains, in particular, those related\
  \ to the prefrontal cortex, contribute to diminished walking performance in complex\
  \ conditions in older age. Studies using functional near infra-red spectroscopy\
  \ (fNIRS) reported inconsistent findings of brain activation age-related changes\
  \ in response to increased task demands. We aimed to study the effects of aging\
  \ on gait and prefrontal activation in complex walking tasks with internal and external\
  \ task demands. Methods Twenty-three healthy young adults (30.9\_\xB1\_3.7\_yrs)\
  \ and 20 healthy older adults (69.7\_\xB1\_5.8\_yrs) participated in this study.\
  \ Gait and prefrontal activation were assessed during three walking conditions:\
  \ (1) usual walking, (2) dual tasking (internal task demands) and, (3) obstacle\
  \ negotiation (external task demands). fNIRS measured changes in oxygenated hemoglobin\
  \ concentrations in the prefrontal cortex. Results Several gait measures were worse\
  \ in older compared to younger adults under all walking conditions (p\_<\_0.005).\
  \ Even at the lowest level of challenge, older adults had significant increases\
  \ in HbO2 levels during usual walking, relative to standing (p\_=\_0.006). Both\
  \ groups showed increased activation during dual-task (p\_<\_0.002) and during obstacle\
  \ negotiation (p\_<\_0.003). Conclusions Prefrontal activation during walking is\
  \ dependent on age and task properties and that older adults apparently rely more\
  \ on cognitive resources even during usual walking task."
