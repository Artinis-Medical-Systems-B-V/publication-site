abstract: "Purpose: Aortic stiffness may affect shear patterns in the peripheral vasculature.\_\
  This study examined if sprint exercise, which typically increases aortic stiffness\
  \ is associated with increased peripheral retrograde blood flow and impaired microvascular\
  \ function. Methods: Twenty participants (10 women; age: 27 \xB1 5\_years) underwent\
  \ arterial stiffness, shear rate, and microvascular function assessment at three\
  \ time points: baseline; following time control; $\u223C$ 2\_min post a 30-s cycle\
  \ ergometer sprint against 7.0% body mass. Aortic stiffness was assessed using carotid-femoral\
  \ pulse wave velocity (cfPWV). Superficial femoral artery (SFA) diameter and blood\
  \ velocity were assessed using Doppler-ultrasound and were used to calculate shear\
  \ rates and resistance index (RI). SFA wave reflections were obtained via wave intensity\
  \ analysis. Vastus medialis microvascular function was measured as tissue saturation\
  \ index reactivity pre-post exercise via near-infrared spectroscopy. Results: cfPWV\
  \ increased by + 0.8 \xB1 0.7\_m\u02D9s\u22121 following exercise (p < 0.001). Retrograde\
  \ shear was reduced following exercise compared with time control (\u2212\_4.9 \xB1\
  \ 3.8\_s\u22121; p < 0.001), while tissue saturation index was increased post-exercise\
  \ from baseline (+ 2.3 \xB1 4.6%; p = 0.04). Reductions in SFA wave reflections\
  \ (\u2212\_1.70 \xB1 1.96\_aU) and RI (\u2212\_0.17 \xB1 0.13\_aU) were also noted\
  \ following exercise (p < 0.001). Conclusion: These data suggest sprint exercise-mediated\
  \ changes in peripheral shear patterns and microvascular function in the exercised\
  \ vasculature occur independent from increases in aortic stiffness. Exercise-induced\
  \ reductions in SFA retrograde shear may be related to decreased wave reflections\
  \ and peripheral vascular resistance."
