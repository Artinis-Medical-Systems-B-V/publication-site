abstract: "Purpose: Experimental studies indicate that perioperative hypoperfusion\
  \ impairs anastomotic healing. In bowel surgery, the part of bowel that will be\
  \ anastomosed is often pedicled, leaving the blood supply dependent on the marginal\
  \ artery only. Little is known about the blood supply in such a segment, and whether\
  \ anastomotic strength is affected when flow would be reduced. This study describes\
  \ oxygenation and blood flow in pedicled bowel segments in the rat and investigates\
  \ whether early anastomotic strength changes with variations in blood flow. Methods:\
  \ In rats, pedicled segments were created in ileum and colon by successive ligation\
  \ of the feeding arteries. Oxygenation and blood flow were measured in the distal\
  \ part of this segment by use of near-infrared spectroscopy with indocyanine green\
  \ as an intravascular tracer. In a second experiment, a short pedicled colonic segment\
  \ was created and, after flow measurements, an anastomosis was constructed. Wound\
  \ strength and hydroxyproline content were analyzed 2 and 5 days after operation.\
  \ Results: After creation of a pedicled segment, the concentration of oxygenated\
  \ hemoglobin decreased significantly. Blood flow also significantly decreased to\
  \ even less than 10% of baseline. A very large variation was observed between animals,\
  \ in particular, after ligation of the first arteries. The strength of colonic anastomoses\
  \ was not significantly correlated with the blood flow in the pedicled segment before\
  \ anastomotic construction. Conclusions: The creation of a pedicled bowel segment\
  \ greatly reduces tissue oxygenation and blood flow to its distal part. Such impaired\
  \ perioperative flow does not significantly affect early wound strength after anastomotic\
  \ construction. \xA9 2009 The ASCRS."
