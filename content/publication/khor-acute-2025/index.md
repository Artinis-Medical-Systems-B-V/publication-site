abstract: Objective This study investigates whether 5-min ischemic preconditioning
  (IR5) more effectively reduces submaximal exercise blood pressure and improves muscle
  oxygenation compared to 2-min ischemia (IR2) or 2-min isometric priming (IM2). Methods
  Twenty untrained men (10 prehypertensive; 10 normotensive) completed, in randomized
  order, IR5 (3 × 5 min bilateral limb occlusion at 220 mmHg), IR2 (3 × 2 min bilateral
  occlusion), and IM2 (3 × 2 min 30 % maximal voluntary contraction isometric knee
  extension), each followed by the submaximal exercise test. Outcomes were exercise
  heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP),
  mean arterial pressure (MAP), and vastus lateralis muscle oxygenation including
  Δdeoxyhemoglobin (ΔHHb), Δtotal hemoglobin (ΔtHb), and Δtissue saturation index
  (ΔTSI). Results IR5 significantly attenuated the submaximal pressor response, reducing
  SBP by mean difference (MD) = −2.23 mmHg (P textless .001, ηp2 = 0.395) compared
  with both IR2 and IM2. A significant Condition × Group interaction (P = .023) indicated
  that the MAP reduction was confined to prehypertensive participants (MD = −3.14
  mmHg, P = .003). During exercise, IR5 increased ΔtHb by MD = 1.56 μmol/L (ηp2 =
  0.606) and mitigated the decline in ΔTSI by MD = 2.98 % (ηp2 = 0.716) without altering
  ΔHHb. In contrast, IR2 and IM2 elicited similar occlusion-phase deoxygenation but
  did not modify exercise hemodynamics or oxygenation metrics. Conclusion IR5 effectively
  lowers SBP and MAP during submaximal exercise and improves muscle oxygenation. It
  is a safe, non-pharmacological pre-exercise strategy to manage blood pressure and
  potentially reduce cardiovascular risk.
