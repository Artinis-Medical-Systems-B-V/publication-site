abstract: "Objectives: To evaluate whether application of a transducer on the anterior\
  \ fontanelle during cranial ultrasound (US) examination effects cerebral hemodynamics\
  \ and oxygenation in preterm infants. Study design*: During cranial US examination,\
  \ changes in cerebral blood oxygenation (cHbD) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) were\
  \ assessed using near infrared spectrophotometry (NIRS) in 76 infants (GA 30.7 (4.1)\
  \ wk, BW 1423 (717) g) within two days after birth. Ten of these infants (GA 29.1\
  \ (1.6) wk, BW 1092 (455) g) were studied again at a postnatal age of one week.\
  \ Results*: We obtained stable and consistent NIRS registrations in 54 infants within\
  \ the first two days after birth. Twenty-eight of these infants showed a decrease\
  \ in cHbD (0.59 (0.54) $\u03BC$mol/100 g) during the scanning procedure while CBV\
  \ did not change. Twenty-four infants showed no changes in NIRS and 2 infants showed\
  \ an atypical NIRS response during cranial US examination. At the postnatal age\
  \ of one week, stable and consistent NIRS registrations were obtained in 7 infants.\
  \ None of these infants showed changes in NIRS variables during cranial US examination.\
  \ Conclusions: Application of an US transducer on the anterior fontanelle causes\
  \ changes in cerebral oxygenation and hemodynamics in a substantial number of preterm\
  \ infants. (*values are expressed as median (interquartile range)). \xA9 2008 Elsevier\
