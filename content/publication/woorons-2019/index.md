abstract: "Ten highly-trained Jiu-Jitsu fighters performed 2 repeated-sprint sessions,\
  \ each including 2 sets of 8 x $\u223C$6 s back-and-forth running sprints on a tatami.\
  \ One session was carried out with normal breathing (RSN) and the other with voluntary\
  \ hypoventilation at low lung volume (RSH-VHL). Prefrontal and vastus lateralis\
  \ muscle oxyhemoglobin ([O 2 Hb]) and deoxyhemoglobin ([HHb]) were monitored by\
  \ near-infrared spectroscopy. Arterial oxygen saturation (SpO 2), heart rate (HR),\
  \ gas exchange and maximal blood lactate concentration ([La] max) were also assessed.\
  \ SpO 2 was significantly lower in RSH-VHL than in RSN whereas there was no difference\
  \ in HR. Muscle oxygenation was not different between conditions during the entire\
  \ exercise. On the other hand, in RSH-VHL, cerebral oxygenation was significantly\
  \ lower than in RSN (-6.1\xB15.4 vs-1.5\xB16.6 $\u03BC$m). Oxygen uptake was also\
  \ higher during the recovery periods whereas [La] max tended to be lower in RSH-VHL.\
  \ The time of the sprints was not different between conditions. This study shows\
  \ that repeated shuttle-run sprints with VHL has a limited impact on muscle deoxygenation\
  \ but induces a greater fall in cerebral oxygenation compared with normal breathing\
  \ conditions. Despite this phenomenon, performance is not impaired, probably because\
  \ of a higher oxygen uptake during the recovery periods following sprints."
