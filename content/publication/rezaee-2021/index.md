abstract: "Feasibility of portable neuroimaging of cerebellar transcranial direct\
  \ current stimulation (ctDCS) effects on the cerebral cortex has not been investigated\
  \ vis-\xE0-vis cerebellar lobular electric field strength. We studied functional\
  \ near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in conjunction with electroencephalography\
  \ (EEG) to measure changes in the brain activation at the prefrontal cortex (PFC)\
  \ and the sensorimotor cortex (SMC) following ctDCS as well as virtual reality\u2013\
  based balance training (VBaT) before and after ctDCS treatment in 12 hemiparetic\
  \ chronic stroke survivors. We performed general linear modeling (GLM) that putatively\
  \ associated the lobular electric field strength with the changes in the fNIRS-EEG\
  \ measures at the ipsilesional and contra-lesional PFC and SMC. Here, fNIRS-EEG\
  \ measures were found in the latent space from canonical correlation analysis (CCA)\
  \ between the changes in total hemoglobin (tHb) concentrations (0.01\u20130.07Hz\
  \ and 0.07\u20130.13Hz bands) and log10-transformed EEG bandpower within 1\u2013\
  45 Hz where significant (Wilks' lambda>0.95) canonical correlations were found only\
  \ for the 0.07\u20130.13-Hz band. Also, the first principal component (97.5% variance\
  \ accounted for) of the mean lobular electric field strength was a good predictor\
  \ of the latent variables of oxy-hemoglobin (O2Hb) concentrations and log10-transformed\
  \ EEG bandpower. GLM also provided insights into non-responders to ctDCS who also\
  \ performed poorly in the VBaT due to ideomotor apraxia. Future studies should investigate\
  \ fNIRS-EEG joint-imaging in a larger cohort to identify non-responders based on\
  \ GLM fitting to the fNIRS-EEG data."
