abstract: Collaborative robots (cobots) have largely replaced conventional industrial
  robots in today’s workplaces, particularly in manufacturing setups, due to their
  improved performance and intelligent design. In the framework of Industry 5.0, humans
  are working alongside cobots to accomplish the required level of automation. However,
  human–robot interaction has brought up concerns regarding human factors (HF) and
  ergonomics. A human worker may experience cognitive stress as a result of cobots’
  irresponsive nature in unpredictably occurring situations, which adversely affects
  productivity. Therefore, there is a necessity to measure stress to enhance a human
  worker’s performance in a human–robot collaborative environment. In this study,
  factory workers’ mental workload was assessed using physiological, behavioural,
  and subjective measures. Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared
  spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals were collected to acquire brain signals and track hemodynamic
  activity, respectively. The effect of task complexity, cobot movement speed, and
  cobot payload capacity on the mental stress of a human worker were observed for
  a task designed in the context of a smart factory. Task complexity and cobot speed
  proved to be more impactful. As physiological measures are unbiased and more authentic
  means to estimate stress, eventually they may replace the other conventional measures
  if they prove to correlate with the results of traditional ones. Here, regression
  and artificial neural networks (ANN) were utilised to determine the correlation
  between physiological data and subjective and behavioural measures. Regression performed
  better for most of the targets and the best correlation (rsq-adj = 0.654146) was
  achieved for predicting missed beeps, a behavioural measure, using a combination
  of multiple EEG and fNIRS predictors. The k-nearest neighbours (KNN) algorithm was
  used to evaluate the accuracy of correlation between traditional measures and physiological
  variables, with the highest accuracy of 77.8% achieved for missed beeps as the target.
  Results show that physiological measures can be more insightful and have the tendency
  to replace other biased parameters.
