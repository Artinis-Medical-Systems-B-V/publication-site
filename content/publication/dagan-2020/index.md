abstract: "The \u201Clevodopa-overdose hypothesis\u201D posits that dopaminergic replacement\
  \ therapy (1) increases performance on tasks that depend on the nigrostriatal-pathway\
  \ (e.g., motor-control circuits), yet (2) decreases performance on tasks that depend\
  \ upon the mesocorticolimbic-pathway (e.g., prefrontal cortex, PFC). Previous work\
  \ in Parkinson's disease (PD) investigated this model while focusing on cognitive\
  \ function. Here, we evaluated whether this model applies to gait in patients with\
  \ PD and freezing of gait (FOG). Forty participants were examined in both the OFF\
  \ anti-Parkinsonian medication state (hypo-dopaminergic) and ON state (hyper-dopaminergic)\
  \ while walking with and without the concurrent performance of a serial subtraction\
  \ task. Wireless functional near-infrared spectroscopy measured PFC activation during\
  \ walking. Consistent with the \u201Coverdose-hypothesis\u201D, performance on the\
  \ subtraction task decreased (p = 0.027) after dopamine intake. Moreover, the effect\
  \ of walking condition on PFC activation depended on the dopaminergic state (i.e.,\
  \ interaction effect p = 0.001). Gait significantly improved after levodopa administration\
  \ (p < 0.001). Nonetheless, PFC activation was higher (p = 0.013) in this state\
  \ than in the OFF state during usual-walking. This increase in PFC activation in\
  \ the ON state suggests that dopamine treatment interfered with PFC functioning.\
  \ Otherwise, PFC activation, putatively a reflection of cognitive compensation,\
  \ should have decreased. Moreover, in contrast to the OFF state, in the ON state,\
  \ PFC activation failed to increase (p = 0.313) during dual-tasking, perhaps due\
  \ to a \u201Cceiling effect\u201D. These findings extend the \u201Clevodopa-overdose\
  \ hypothesis\u201D and suggest that it also applies to gait in PD patients. While\
  \ dopaminergic therapy improves certain aspects of motor performance, optimal treatment\
  \ should consider the \"double-edged sword\" of levodopa."
