abstract: "Purpose It is still equivocal whether oxygen uptake recovery kinetics are\
  \ limited by oxygen delivery and can be improved by supplementary oxygen. The present\
  \ study aimed to investigate whether measurements of muscle and pulmonary oxygen\
  \ uptake kinetics can be used to assess oxygen delivery limitations in healthy subjects.\
  \ Methods Sixteen healthy young adults performed three sub-maximal exercise tests\
  \ (6 min at 40% Wmax) under hypoxic (14%O2), normoxic (21%O2) and hyperoxic (35%O2)\
  \ conditions on separate days in randomized order. Both Pulmonary VO2 and near infra\
  \ red spectroscopy (NIRS) based Tissue Saturation Index (TSI) offset kinetics were\
  \ calculated using mono-exponential curve fitting models. Results Time constant\
  \ $\u03C4$ of VO2 offset kinetics under hypoxic (44.9 \xB1 7.3s) conditions were\
  \ significantly larger than $\u03C4$ of the offset kinetics under normoxia (37.9\
  \ \xB1 8.2s, p = 0.02) and hyperoxia (37\xB16s, p = 0.04). TSI mean response time\
  \ (MRT) of the offset kinetics under hypoxic conditions (25.5 \xB1 13s) was significantly\
  \ slower than under normoxic (15 \xB1 7.7, p = 0.007) and hyperoxic (13 \xB1 7.3,\
  \ p = 0.008) conditions. Conclusion The present study shows that there was no improvement\
  \ in the oxygen uptake and muscle oxygenation recovery kinetics in healthy subjects\
  \ under hyperoxic conditions. Slower TSI and VO2 recovery kinetics under hypoxic\
  \ conditions indicate that both NIRS and spiro-ergometry are appropriate non-invasive\
  \ measurement tools to assess the physiological response of a healthy individual\
  \ to hypoxic exercise."
