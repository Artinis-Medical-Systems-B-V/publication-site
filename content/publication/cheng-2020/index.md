abstract: "This study examined acute effects of inspiratory resistive loading (IRL)\
  \ during rest intervals on sprint interval exercise (SIE) performance. In a randomized\
  \ crossover design, nine collegiate basketball players performed IRL (15 cmH2O)\
  \ or passive recovery (CON) at 5-min rest intervals during and immediately after\
  \ 6 sets of a 30-s SIE test. Performance, muscular oxygenation of vastus lateralis,\
  \ blood lactate and pH were measured at each condition. Blood lactate at 5-min (\u2212\
  20.5 %) and 20-min (\u221221.3 %) after SIE were significantly lower in IRL than\
  \ in CON. The pH at 5-min after SIE was significantly higher in IRL than in CON\
  \ (+0.8 %, p < 0.05). However, the total work in IRL was significantly lower than\
  \ in CON (\u22122.7 %, p < 0.05). Average changes in total hemoglobin at rest intervals\
  \ in IRL were significantly lower than in CON (\u221234.5 %, p < 0.05). The IRL\
  \ could attenuate exercise-induced metabolic acidosis; however, the decreased blood\
  \ flow at rest intervals might increase the physical challenge in SIE."
