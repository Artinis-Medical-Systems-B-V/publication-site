abstract: 'Abstract  Background Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of mortality
  worldwide. A significant contributing factor to this mortality is the lack of engagement
  in preventive activities. Consequently, strategies for enhancing adherence to and
  duration of physical activity (PA) have become pivotal. This project aims to create
  and validate innovative, disruptive, and secure technologies that ensure appropriate
  exercise intensity, bolster adherence to PA, and monitor health biomarker responses
  pre-, during, and post-physical activity.   Methods This exploratory study, followed
  by a noninferiority, investigator-blinded randomized clinical trial, will be divided
  into three phases: (1) development and validation of a sensor for real-time biofeedback
  during a functional assessment test; (2) integration of biofeedback and gamification
  into an app for the structured prescription of physical training within a controlled
  setting; and (3) implementation of biofeedback and gamification into an app for
  the prescription and monitoring of physical training in an uncontrolled setting.
  Phase 1 entails a validation test of a biosensor—monitoring heart rate (HR) and
  steps—during a modified shuttle walk test. In phase 2, the biosensor interfaces
  with a gamified smartphone application. The training regimen spans 6 weeks, 5 days
  weekly, with each session lasting 60 min: a five-min warm-up involving stationary
  gait, followed by 50 min of training at the target HR on the step and concluding
  with a five-min cool-down at a stationary pace. After 6 weeks of training, a new
  functional capacity test is conducted. Phase 3 involves an investigator-blinded,
  randomized clinical trial to demonstrate noninferiority. Participants are randomly
  assigned to either the intervention group (IG) or the control group (CG). IG participants
  practice exercise using the gamified application in an uncontrolled environment
  according to the prescribed method outlined in phase 2. CG participants receive
  PA practice guidelines exclusively.   Discussion Anticipated outcomes include improved
  exercise adherence through the gamified application, better maintenance of prescribed
  exercise intensity, and enhanced health biomarkers. The results of this study will
  inform health-related decision-making.   Trial registration The study protocol received
  approval from the Ethics Committee of Universidade Federal de Ciências da Saúde
  de Porto Alegre (54,492,221.80000.5345) and has been registered with the Brazilian
  Registry of Clinical Trials (ReBEC, RBR-359p69v).'
