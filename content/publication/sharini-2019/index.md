abstract: 'Background: Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience followed
  by anxiety, depression, and frustration. Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)
  as an optical technique identifies the brain functional networks by investigating
  connectivity between functionally linked of different anatomical regions in response
  to pain stimulation. Methods: In this research, fNIRS was performed in order to
  study the difference in effective functional connectivity of the brain prefrontal
  cortex between the two modes of pain and rest based on the dynamic causal modeling
  (DCM) method. Effective functional connectivity changes in the prefrontal cortex
  between pain and rest states were calculated using DCM approach to investigate (1)
  areas known for pain sensation and (2) to analyze inter-network functional connectivity
  strength (FCS) by selecting several brain functional networks based on the analysis
  findings. All analyses were performed using toolboxes SPM-fNIRS and SPM8, Matlab
  software. Results: Regional hemodynamics changes caused deoxyhemoglobin concentration
  to decrease in the prefrontal cortex of both hemispheres, particularly on the right
  side. We found a simultaneous increase in the concentration of oxyhemoglobin in
  the prefrontal cortex of the left hemisphere in comparison to the right hemisphere,
  that there was a trend toward reduction in oxyhemoglobin concentration. The results
  indicate that during the cold pain stimulation, the connectivities between prefrontal
  cortex regions were significantly changed. Specifically, a significantly consistent
  increase in the RPFC to MPFC connectivity was found while a significant consistent
  decrease was observed in the both MPFC to LPFC and LPFC to MPFC connectivities.
  Conclusion: This study contributes to the pain research field to identify the directionality
  and causality of neuronal connections in the prefrontal cortex by applying DCM to
  fNIRS data. The results suggest that the proposed method infers directional interactions
  between hidden neuronal states in the brain under neuronal dynamic conditions based
  on optical density changes measurement.'
