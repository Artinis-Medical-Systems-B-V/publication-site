abstract: "Introduction: As survival of previously considered as lethal congenital\
  \ heart disease forms is the case in our days, issues regarding quality of life\
  \ including sport and daily activities emerge. In patients with Fontan circulation,\
  \ there is no pump to propel blood into the pulmonary arteries since the systemic\
  \ veins are directly connected to the pulmonary arteries. The complex hemodynamics\
  \ of Fontan circulation include atrial function, peripheral muscle pump, integrity\
  \ of the atrioventricular valve, absence of restrictive, or obstructive pulmonary\
  \ lung function. Therefore, thoracic mechanics are of particular importance within\
  \ the complex hemodynamics of Fontan circulation. Methods: To understand the physiology\
  \ of respiratory muscles, the aim of this study was to examine the matching of auxiliary\
  \ respiratory muscle oxygen delivery and utilization during incremental exercise\
  \ in young male Fontan patients (n = 22, age = 12.04 \xB1 2.51) and healthy Controls\
  \ (n = 10, age = 14.90 \xB1 2.23). All subjects underwent a cardiopulmonary exercise\
  \ test (CPET) to exhaustion whereas respiratory muscle oxygenation was measured\
  \ non-invasively using a near-infrared spectrometer (NIRS). Results: CPET revealed\
  \ significantly lower peak power output, oxygen uptake and breath activity in Fontan\
  \ patients. The onset of respiratory muscle deoxygenation was significantly earlier.\
  \ The matching of local muscle perfusion to oxygen demand was significantly worse\
  \ in Fontans between 50 and 90% V.O2peak. Findings: The results indicate that (a)\
  \ there is high strain on respiratory muscles during incremental cycling exercise\
  \ and (b) auxiliary respiratory muscles are worse perfused in patients who underwent\
  \ a Fontan procedure compared to healthy Controls. This might be indicative of a\
  \ more general skeletal muscle strain and worse perfusion in Fontan patients rather\
  \ than a localized-limited to thoracic muscles phenomenon."
