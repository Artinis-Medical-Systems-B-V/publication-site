abstract: 'Introduction Fatigue is defined as loss of capacity to develop muscle force
  and/or velocity that is reversible at rest. We assessed non-invasively the fatigue
  and recovery of inspiratory rib cage muscles during two respiratory endurance tests
  in healthy individuals.   Methods The sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP) was
  assessed before and after two respiratory endurance tests: normocapnic hyperpnea
  (NH) and inspiratory pressure threshold loading (IPTL). Contractile (maximum rate
  of pressure development and time to peak pressure) and relaxation parameters (maximum
  relaxation rate [MRR], time constant of pressure decay [τ], and half relaxation
  time) obtained from sniff curves and shortening velocity and mechanical power estimated
  using optoelectronic plethysmography were analyzed during SNIP maneuvers. Respiratory
  muscle activity (electromyography) and tissue oxygenation (near-infrared spectroscopy—NIRS)
  were obtained during endurance tests and SNIP maneuvers. Fatigue development of
  inspiratory rib cage muscles was assessed according to the slope of decay of median
  frequency.   Results Peak pressure during SNIP decreased after both protocols (p
  textless0.05). MRR, shortening velocity, and mechanical power decreased (p textless0.05),
  whereas τ increased after IPTL (p textless0.05). The median frequency of inspiratory
  rib cage muscles (i.e., sum of sternocleidomastoid, scalene, and parasternal) decreased
  linearly during IPTL and exponentially during NH, mainly due to the sternocleidomastoid.   Conclusion
  Fatigue development behaved differently between protocols and relaxation properties
  (MRR and τ), shortening velocity, and mechanical power changed only in the IPTL.'
