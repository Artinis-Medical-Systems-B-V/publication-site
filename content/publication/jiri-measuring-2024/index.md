abstract: 'Purpose: The critical force (CF) concept, differentiating steady and non-steady
  state conditions, extends the critical power paradigm for sport climbing. This study
  aimed to validate CF for finger flexors derived from the 4 min all-out test as a
  boundary for the highest sustainable work intensity in sport climbers. Methods:
  Twelve participants underwent multiple laboratory visits. Initially, they performed
  the 4 min intermittent contraction all-out test for CF determination. Subsequent
  verification visits involved finger-flexor contractions at various intensities,
  including CF, CF −2 kg, CF −4 kg, and CF −6 kg, lasting for 720 s or until failure,
  while monitoring muscle-oxygen dynamics of forearm muscles. Results: CF, determined
  from the mean force of last three contractions, was measured at 20.1 ± 5.7 kg, while
  the end-force at 16.8 ± 5.2 kg. In the verification trials, the mean time to failure
  at CF was 440 ± 140 s, with only one participant completing the 720 s task. When
  the load was continuously lowered (−2 kg, −4 kg, and −6 kg), a greater number of
  participants (38%, 69%, and 92%, respectively) successfully completed the 720 s
  task. Changes of muscle-oxygen dynamics showed a high variability and could not
  clearly distinguish between exhaustive and non-exhaustive trials. Conclusions: CF,
  based on the mean force of the last three contractions, failed to reliably predict
  the highest sustainable work rate. In contrast, determining CF as the end-force
  of the last three contractions exhibited a stronger link to sustainable work. Caution
  is advised in interpreting forearm muscle-oxygen dynamics, lacking sensitivity for
  nuanced metabolic responses during climbing-related tasks.'
