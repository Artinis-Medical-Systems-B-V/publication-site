abstract: Abstract Downward gazing is often observed when walking requires guidance.
  This gaze behavior is thought to promote walking stability through anticipatory
  stepping control. This study is part of an ongoing effort to investigate whether
  downward gazing also serves to enhance postural control, which can promote walking
  stability through a feedback/reactive mechanism. Since gaze behavior alone gives
  no indication as to what information is gathered and the functions it serves, we
  aimed to investigate the cognitive demands associated with downward gazing, as they
  are likely to differ between anticipatory and feedback use of visual input. To do
  so, we used a novel methodology to compromise walking stability in a manner that
  could not be resolved through modulation of stepping. Then, using interference methodology
  and neuroimaging, we tested for (1) interference related to dual tasking, and (2)
  changes in prefrontal activity. The novel methodology resulted in an increase in
  the time spent looking at the walking surface. Further, while some dual-task interference
  was observed, indicating that this gaze behavior is cognitively demanding, several
  gaze parameters pertaining to downward gazing and prefrontal activity correlated.
  These correlations revealed that a greater tendency to gaze onto the walking surface
  was associated with lower PFC activity, as is expected when sensory information
  is used through highly automatic, and useful, neural circuitry. These results, while
  not conclusive, do suggest that gazing onto the walking surface can be used for
  purposes other than anticipatory stepping control, bearing important motor-control
  and clinical implications.
