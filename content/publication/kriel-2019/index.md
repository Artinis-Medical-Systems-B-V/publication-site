abstract: "Background: Sprint interval training (SIT) can be as effective, or more\
  \ effective, than continuous moderate intensity exercise (CMIE) for improving a\
  \ primary risk factor for cardiometabolic disease, low cardiorespiratory fitness\
  \ (CRF). However, there has been no direct comparison in inactive individuals, of\
  \ the acute effects of a session of SIT with a work-matched session of CMIE on local\
  \ oxygen utilisation, which is a primary stimulus for increasing CRF. Furthermore,\
  \ post-exercise blood pressure (BP) and enjoyment, if symptomatic and low, respectively,\
  \ have implications for safety and adherence to exercise and have not been compared\
  \ between these specific conditions. It was hypothesised that in young inactive\
  \ men, local oxygen utilisation would be higher, while post-exercise BP and enjoyment\
  \ would be lower for SIT, when compared to CMIE. Methods: A total of 11 inactive\
  \ men (mean \xB1 SD; age 23 \xB1 4 years) completed a maximal ramp-incremental exercise\
  \ test followed by two experiment conditions: (1) SIT and (2) work-matched CMIE\
  \ on a cycle ergometer on separate days. Deoxygenated haemoglobin ($\u0394$HHb)\
  \ in the pre-frontal cortex (FH), gastrocnemius (GN), left vastus lateralis (LVL)\
  \ and the right vastus lateralis (RVL) muscles, systemic oxygen utilisation (VO2),\
  \ systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure and physical activity enjoyment\
  \ scale (PACES) were measured during the experiment conditions. Results: During\
  \ SIT, compared to CMIE, $\u03B4$HHb in FH (p = 0.016) and GN (p = 0.001) was higher,\
  \ while PACES (p = 0.032) and DBP (p = 0.043) were lower. No differences in SBP\
  \ and $\u0394$HHb in LVL and RVL were found between conditions. Conclusions: In\
  \ young inactive men, higher levels of physiological stress occurred during SIT,\
  \ which potentially contributed to lower levels of post-exercise DBP and enjoyment,\
  \ when compared to CMIE."
