abstract: "This study aimed to investigate the involvement of cerebral oxygenation\
  \ in limitation of maximal exercise. We hypothesized that O2 supplementation improves\
  \ physical performance in relation to its effect on cerebral oxygenation during\
  \ exercise. Eight untrained men (age 27 \xB1 6 years; VO2max 45 \xB1 8 ml min-1\
  \ kg-1) performed two randomized exhaustive ramp exercises on a cycle ergometer\
  \ (1 W/3 s) under normoxia and hyperoxia (FIO2 = 0.3). Cerebral ($\u0394$COx) and\
  \ muscular ($\u0394$MOx) oxygenation responses to exercise were monitored using\
  \ near-infrared spectroscopy. Power outputs corresponding to maximal exercise intensity,\
  \ to threshold of $\u0394$COx decline (ThCOx) and to the respiratory compensation\
  \ point (RCP) were determined. Power output W max = 302 \xB1 20 vs. 319 \xB1 28\
  \ W) and arterial O 2 saturation estimated by pulse oximetry (SpO2 = 95.7 \xB1 0.9\
  \ vs. 97.0 \xB1 0.5 %) at maximal exercise were increased by hyperoxia (P < 0.05).\
  \ However, the $\u0394$MOx response during exercise was not significantly modified\
  \ with hyperoxia. RCP (259 \xB1 17 vs. 281 \xB1 25 W) and ThCOx (259 \xB1 23 vs.\
  \ 288 \xB1 30 W) were, however, improved (P < 0.05) with hyperoxia and the ThCOx\
  \ shift was related to the (Wmax improvement with hyperoxia (r = 0.71, P < 0.05).\
  \ The relationship between the change in cerebral oxygenation response to exercise\
  \ and the performance improvement with hyperoxia supports that cerebral oxygenation\
  \ is limiting the exercise performance in healthy young subjects. \xA9 2013 Springer-Verlag\
