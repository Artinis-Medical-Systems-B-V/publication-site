abstract: 'Background/Objectives: Art-based interventions have been shown to enhance
  communication skills in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), yet their
  impact on prefrontal hemodynamics remains unclear. Methods: This study employed
  functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to examine hemoglobin oxygenation
  (HbO) changes in the prefrontal cortex of school-age children with ASD, providing
  empirical support for its therapeutic efficacy. Sixty age-matched children participated
  in a 9-week art therapy program, including twenty ASD children and forty typically
  developing peers. Assessments included self-portrait drawing (SPD), the Diagnostic
  Drawing Series (DDS), and the General Quality of Life Inventory (GQOL-74). In addition,
  we performed fNIRS measurements in the ASD participants and observed changes in
  prefrontal HbO at rest and while drawing. Results: The drawing intervention significantly
  enhanced drawing ability, emotional expression, and cognitive skills, with the intervention
  group outperforming the controls. ASD participants exhibited distinct prefrontal
  connectivity patterns with visual, motor, and language-related regions, including
  the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, frontal eye field, and Broca’s area. Task-based
  painting interventions indirectly influenced the frontal lobe’s hemodynamic characteristics,
  indicating drawing intervention as an effective intervention for ASD.'
