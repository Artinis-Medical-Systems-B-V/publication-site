abstract: "Brain near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is emerging as a potential alternative\
  \ to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). To date, no study has explicitly\
  \ compared the two techniques in terms of measurement variability, a key parameter\
  \ dictating attainable statistical power. Here, NIRS and fMRI were simultaneously\
  \ recorded during event-related visual stimulation. Inter-subject coefficients of\
  \ variation (CVs) for peak response amplitude were considerably larger for NIRS\
  \ than fMRI, but inter-subject CVs for response latency and intra-subject CVs for\
  \ response amplitude were overall comparable. Our results may represent an optimistic\
  \ estimate of the CVs of NIRS measurements, as optode positioning was guided by\
  \ structural MRI, which is normally unavailable. We concluded that fMRI may be preferable\
  \ to NIRS for group comparisons, but NIRS is equally powerful when comparing conditions\
  \ within participants. The discrepancy between inter- and intra-subject CVs is likely\
  \ related to variability in head anatomy and tissue properties, which may be better\
  \ accounted for by emerging NIRS technology. \xA9 2011 Informa UK, Ltd."
