  ,   Postmenopausal women have reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and impairments
  within the microcirculation and lower limb conduit arteries, key factors contributing
  to cardiovascular disease (CVD) development and mortality. Dietary nitrate supplementation
  has shown promise in improving vascular function, yet most studies are limited to
  short-term interventions and upper-limb conduit artery function assessment. We investigated
  whether a 12-wk nitrate-rich beetroot extract supplementation improves lower-limb
  conduit artery and skeletal muscle microvascular function, alongside serum angiogenic
  potential, in postmenopausal women. Postmenopausal women (60–85 yr) were randomized
  to consume nitrate-rich (8.8 mmol nitrate, n = 8) or nitrate-depleted beetroot extract
  (0.7 mmol nitrate, n = 8) daily for 12 wk. Femoral artery endothelial function was
  assessed via flow-mediated dilation (FMD), whereas tibialis anterior muscle microvascular
  reactivity was evaluated by near-infrared spectroscopy-derived reperfusion slope
  (StO 2 slope 2) every 4 wk. Serum angiogenic potential was evaluated through endothelial
  tube formation assays using human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Serum nitrate
  increased significantly at weeks 4, 8, and 12 in the nitrate-rich group ( P textless
  0.05), with no changes in controls. Femoral artery FMD improved significantly after
  12 wk ( P textless 0.05), whereas tibialis anterior microvascular reactivity increased
  after 8 and 12 wk ( P textless 0.05). Serum from nitrate-supplemented participants
  at week 12 induced a 1.8-fold increase in vitro tube formation compared with baseline
  ( P textless 0.05). Collectively, the current findings suggest nitrate-rich beetroot
  extract as a potential dietary strategy to attenuate the vascular detrimental effects
  of menopause and reduce CVD risk in older women.  NEW & NOTEWORTHY Postmenopausal
  women exhibit impaired lower limb vascular function and reduced angiogenic capacity,
  increasing cardiovascular risk. This study demonstrates that 12 wk of nitrate-rich
  beetroot extract supplementation enhances femoral artery endothelial function, skeletal
  muscle microvascular reactivity, and serum angiogenic potential, offering a promising
  dietary strategy to improve vascular health in this population.
