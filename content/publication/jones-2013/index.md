abstract: "Portable near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) devices were originally developed\
  \ for use in exercise and sports science by Britton Chance in the 1990s (the RunMan\
  \ and microRunman series). However, only recently with the development of more robust,\
  \ and wireless systems, has the routine use in elite sport become possible. As with\
  \ the medical use of NIRS, finding applications of the technology that are relevant\
  \ to practitioners is the key issue. One option is to use NIRS to track exercise\
  \ training-induced adaptations in muscle. Portable NIRS devices enable monitoring\
  \ during the normal 'field' routine uses to assess fitness, such as repeat sprint\
  \ shuttle tests. Knowledge about the acute physiological responses to these specific\
  \ tests has practical applications within team sport training prescription, where\
  \ development of both central and peripheral determinants of high-intensity intermittent\
  \ exercise needs to be considered. The purpose of this study was to observe NIRS-detected\
  \ parameters during a repeat sprint test. We used the PortaMon, a two wavelength\
  \ spatially resolved NIR spectrometer manufactured by Artinis Inc., to assess NIR\
  \ changes in the gastrocnemius muscle of both the left and right leg during high-intensity\
  \ running. Six university standard rugby players were assessed (age 20 \xB1 1.5\
  \ years; height 183 \xB1 1.0 cm; weight 89.4 \xB1 5.8 kg; body fat 12.2 \xB1 3.0\
  \ %); the subjects completed nine repeated shuttle runs, which incorporated forward,\
  \ backward and change of direction movements. Individual sprint time, total time\
  \ to complete test, blood lactate response (BL), heart rate values (HR) and haemoglobin\
  \ variables ($\u0394$HHb, $\u0394$tHb, $\u0394$HbO<inf>2</inf> and $\u0394$TSI%)\
  \ were measured. Total time to complete the test was 260 \xB1 20 s, final blood\
  \ lactate was 14.3 \xB1 2.8 mM, and maximal HR 182 \xB1 5 bpm. NIRS variables displayed\
  \ no differences between right and left legs. During the test, the group-averaged\
  \ data showed a clear decrease in HbO<inf>2</inf> (max. decrease 11.41 \xB1 4.95\
  \ $\u03BC$M), increase in HHb (max. increase 17.65 \xB1 4.48 $\u03BC$M) and drop\
  \ in %TSI (max. drop-24.44 \xB1 4.63 %). tHb was largely unchanged. However, large\
  \ interindividual differences were seen for all the NIRS parameters. In conclusion,\
  \ this observational study suggests that a portable NIRS device is both robust and\
  \ sensitive enough to detect haemoglobin changes during a high-intensity repeated\
  \ shuttle run test. It therefore has the possibility to be used to assess exercise\
  \ training-induced adaptations following a specific training protocol. However,\
  \ it is at present unclear, given the individual variability, whether NIRS can be\
  \ used to assess individual performance. We recommend that future studies report\
  \ individual as well as group data. \xA9 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New\
