abstract: Endurance cyclists have a substantial risk to develop flow limitations in
  the iliac arteries during their career. These flow limitations are due to extreme
  hemodynamic stress which may result in functional arterial kinking and/or intravascular
  lesions. Early diagnosis may improve outcome and could prevent the necessity for
  surgical vascular repair. However, current diagnostic techniques have unsatisfactory
  sensitivity and cannot be applied during exercise. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)
  has shown great diagnostic potential in peripheral vascular disease and might bring
  a solution since it measures tissue oxygenation in real time during and after exercise.
  This report describes the first experiences of the application of NIRS in the vastus
  lateralis muscle during and after maximal graded cycling exercise in ten healthy
  participants and in three patients with flow limitations due to (1) subtle functional
  kinking, (2) an intravascular lesion, and (3) severe functional kinking. The results
  are put into perspective based on an empirically fitted model. Delayed recovery,
  showing clearly different types of patterns of tissue reoxygenation after exercise,
  was found in the affected athletes compared with the healthy participants. In the
  patients that had kinking of the arteries, tissue reoxygenation was clearly more
  delayed if NIRS was measured in provocative position with flexed hip. In this pilot
  experiment, clearly distinctive reoxygenation patterns are observed during recovery
  consistent with severity of flow limitation, indicating that NIRS is a promising
  diagnostic tool to detect and grade arterial flow limitations in athletes. Our findings
  may guide research and optimization of NIRS for future clinical application.
