abstract: Sitting‐induced impairments in postprandial blood flow are an important
  link between sedentary behaviour and cardiometabolic disease risk. The objective
  of this work was to examine the effects of resistance exercise breaks (REB) performed
  every 30 min during an otherwise sedentary 3‐h period on the vasodilatory response
  to a subsequent oral glucose load in sedentary adults. Twenty‐four sedentary adults
  (27 ± 7 years, 16 females) completed two conditions. Fasting blood glucose, insulin,
  popliteal artery blood flow (PABF) and gastrocnemius perfusion were measured immediately
  before standardized breakfast consumption. After breakfast, the 3‐h REB or uninterrupted
  (SIT) intervention period commenced. Participants sat at a workstation, and popliteal
  artery shear rate (PASR) was measured 60 and 120 min into this period. In the REB
  condition, participants performed a 3‐min REB (3 × [20 s squats, 20 s high knees,
  20 s calf raises]) every 30 min. Following the intervention period, baseline measurements
  were repeated. Participants then consumed a 75 g glucose beverage, and PABF and
  perfusion were measured every 30–60 min for the following 120 min. Relative to SIT,
  REB increased PASR at 60 min (+31.4 ± 9.2/s, P = 0.037) and 120 min (+37.4 ± 10.2/s,
  P = 0.019) into the intervention period. Insulin and glucose increased (P textless 0.001)
  in response to glucose consumption, with no differences between conditions (P ≥ 0.299).
  In response to the glucose load, perfusion (1.57 vs. 1.11 mL/100 mL/min, P = 0.023)
  and PABF (+45.3 ± 11.8 mL/min, P = 0.001) were greater after REB versus SIT. Performing
  3‐min REB every 30 min during an otherwise sedentary 3‐h period augmented leg blood
  flow responses to an oral glucose load.
