abstract: "Optimizing traditional training methods to elicit greater adaptations is\
  \ paramount for athletes. Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) can improve maximal exercise\
  \ capacity and up-regulate signaling pathways involved in physiological training\
  \ adaptations. However, data on the chronic use of IPC are scarce and its impact\
  \ on high-intensity training is still unknown. We investigated the benefits of adding\
  \ IPC to sprint-interval training (SIT) on performance and physiological adaptations\
  \ of endurance athletes. In a randomized controlled trial, athletes included eight\
  \ SIT sessions in their training routine for 4 weeks, preceded by IPC (3 \xD7 5min\
  \ ischemia/5min reperfusion cycles at 220 mmHg, n = 11) or a placebo (20 mmHg, n\
  \ = 9). Athletes were tested pre-, mid-, and post-training on a 30 s Wingate test,\
  \ 5-km time trial (TT), and maximal incremental step test. Arterial O2 saturation,\
  \ heart rate, rate of perceived exertion, and quadriceps muscle oxygenation changes\
  \ in total hemoglobin (1[THb]), deoxyhemoglobin (1[HHb]), and tissue saturation\
  \ index (1TSI) were measured during exercise. Blood samples were taken pre- and\
  \ post-training to determine blood markers of hypoxic response, lipid-lipoprotein\
  \ profile, and immune function. Differences within and between groups were analyzed\
  \ using Cohen's effect size (ES). Compared to PLA, IPC improved time to complete\
  \ the TT (Mid vs. Post: \u22121.6%, Cohen's ES \xB1 90% confidence limits \u2212\
  0.24, \u22120.40;\u22120.07) and increased power output (Mid vs. Post: 4.0%, ES\
  \ 0.20, 0.06;0.35), 1[THb] (Mid vs. Post: 73.6%, ES 0.70, \u22120.15;1.54, Pre vs.\
  \ Post: 68.5%, ES 0.69, \u22120.05;1.43), 1[HHb] (Pre vs. Post: 12.7%, ES 0.24,\
  \ \u22120.11;0.59) and heart rate (Pre vs. Post: 1.4%, ES 0.21, \u22120.13;0.55,\
  \ Mid vs. Post: 1.6%, ES 0.25, \u22120.09;0.60). IPC also attenuated the fatigue\
  \ index in the Wingate test (Mid vs. Post: \u22128.4%, ES \u22120.37, \u22120.79;0.05).\
  \ VO2peak and maximal aerobic power remained unchanged in both groups. Changes in\
  \ blood markers of the hypoxic response, vasodilation, and angiogenesis remained\
  \ within the normal clinical range in both groups. We concluded that IPC combined\
  \ with SIT induces greater adaptations in cycling endurance performance that may\
  \ be related to muscle perfusion and metabolic changes. The absence of elevated\
  \ markers of immune function suggests that chronic IPC is devoid of deleterious\
  \ effects in athletes, and is thus a safe and potent ergogenic tool."
