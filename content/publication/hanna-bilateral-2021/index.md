abstract: Background Non-invasive determination of mitochondrial capacity via near
  infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) typically involves voluntary exercise of a single muscle
  group followed by as many as 26 brief ischemic cuff occlusions to determine a single
  recovery rate constant (k).  Purpose To determine the within- and between-visit
  repeatability of a shortened bilateral NIRS protocol, and to establish the feasibility
  of hamstring k measurements.  Methods Sixteen young (eight women, eight men; 22
  ± 3 years) active adults underwent a bilateral electrical stimulation protocol in
  which multiple (n = 4) measurements of k for the vastus lateralis (VL) and medial
  hamstring (MH) muscles were determined on two visits. Repeatability (CV% and intraclass
  correlations, ICC) and equivalency across visits were assessed for both muscles.  Results
  Mean k values in the VL were consistent with published values and within-visit ICCs
  were moderately high for both muscles in both sexes. In men, average k values on
  visit 2 were within 1% (VL muscle) and 5% (MH muscle) of the values on visit 1 (all
  p textgreater 0.78). In women, average k values were 10%–15% lower on visit 2 (p
  = 0.01 and p = 0.15 for MH and VL) with the largest between-visit differences in
  a subset of participants with the most days between visits.  Conclusions This bilateral
  NIRS protocol is time efficient and provides valid estimates of k in both sexes
  and muscle groups with acceptable within-visit repeatability. Lower than expected
  between-visit repeatability in some participants reinforces the need for further
  investigation of this newly developed protocol to identify and control for experimental
  and behavioral sources of variation.
