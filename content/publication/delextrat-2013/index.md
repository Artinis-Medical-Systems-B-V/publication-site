abstract: "The aim of the current study was to compare the effects of 6 weeks of small-sided\
  \ game (SSG) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on aerobic fitness and\
  \ muscle oxygenation during a repeated sprint (RS) sequence in elite male junior\
  \ basketball players. Twenty participants (14.3 \xB1 0.5 years; 176.8 \xB1 12.5\
  \ cm; 74.5 \xB1 9.8 kg) performed pre- and post-tests interspersed by 6 weeks of\
  \ SSG or HIIT training. Testing sessions consisted of the 30-15 intermittent fitness\
  \ test and an RS sequence (2 bouts of 15 seconds). During RS, muscle oxygenation\
  \ parameters (tissue saturation index [TSI, %], postsprint muscle reoxygenation\
  \ rate) were measured using near-infrared spectroscopy. The results showed that\
  \ both training interventions similarly improved maximal aerobic speed (V IFT ,\
  \ 3.4 and 4.1%, respectively, for HIIT and SSG, P < 0.05) as well as RS ability\
  \ (smaller percentage decrement by 62.5 and 21.6%, respectively, for HIIT and SSG,\
  \ P < 0.05). Both training interventions also resulted in a greater $\u0394$TSI\
  \ during the second sprint (47.8-114%, P < 0.05) and significant improvements in\
  \ postsprint reoxygenation after both sprints (+23.0 to +107.7%). Finally, the variation\
  \ in muscle reoxygenation after sprint 1 was significantly associated with improvements\
  \ in aerobic ($\u0394$V IFT , r = 0.61, P = 0.008) and anaerobic ($\u0394$% Dec\
  \ during RS, r = 20.487, P = 0.028) performances. The current study has observed\
  \ that SSG and HIIT resulted in similar improvements in aerobic and anaerobic variables\
  \ and a better muscle oxygenation capacity during RS. Coaches should be aware that\
  \ both trainings are applicable methodologies to improve in-season aerobic and anaerobic\
  \ fitness capacities in junior basketball players."
