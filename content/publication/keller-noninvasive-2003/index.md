abstract: "To find a suitable method for measuring regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF)\
  \ rapidly at the bedside is still a matter of investigation. The purpose here was\
  \ to develop a noninvasive method for bedside rCBF measurement and to validate it\
  \ with a standard method such as perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\
  \ In 11 healthy volunteers 44 measurements with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)\
  \ and perfusion-weighted MRI without and with a mean continuous positive airway\
  \ pressure (CPAP) of 10 mbar were carried out. Four (NIRS) optodes were placed bilaterally\
  \ on the forehead and 25 mg indocyanine green (ICG) was injected. New algorithms\
  \ were developed to calculate rCBFNIRS and rCBVNIRS. In 6 volunteers data analysis\
  \ was successful. No complications associated with the method were observed. During\
  \ CPAP breathing rCBFNIRS decreased from 18.5 + 6.9 16.1 + 6.2 ml/100 g/min (P =\
  \ 0.034). Mean values for rCBFMRI decreased from 256 \xB1 90 to 216 \xB1 62 ml/100\
  \ g/min (P = 0.012). Bland and Altman plots showed that the differences did not\
  \ vary in any systematic way over the range of rCBF or rCBV values assessed and\
  \ 100% of differences were within the interval mean \xB1 2 SD of differences. Limits\
  \ of agreement (mean \xB1 2 SD) were \xB1 76.4 ml/100 g/min for rCBF and \xB1 15.6\
  \ ml/100 g for rCBV. The NIRS ICG dye dilution technique is a promising method for\
  \ serial noninvasive bedside CBF measurements. The preliminary data indicate that\
  \ measurements are in agreement with values obtained by perfusion-weighted MRI.\
