abstract: "Central motor drive to active muscles is believed to be reduced during\
  \ numerous exercise tasks to prevent excessive peripheral fatigue development. The\
  \ purpose of the present study was to use hypoxia to exacerbate physiological perturbations\
  \ during a novel, intermittent exercise task and to explore the time-course and\
  \ interplay between central and peripheral neuromuscular adjustments. On separate\
  \ days, 14 healthy men performed four sets of 6 \xD7 5 maximal-intensity, isokinetic\
  \ leg extensions (1 repetition lasting \u223C7 s) at 300\xB0/s (15 and 100 s of\
  \ passive rest between repetitions and sets, respectively) under normoxia (NM, fraction\
  \ of inspired O2 0.21), moderate (MH, 0.14), and severe normobaric hypoxia (SH,\
  \ 0.10). Neuromuscular assessments of the knee extensors were conducted before and\
  \ immediately after each set. There was an interaction between time and condition\
  \ on the mean peak torque produced during each set (P < 0.05). RMS/M-wave activity\
  \ of the rectus femoris decreased across the four sets of exercise, but there was\
  \ no difference between conditions (8.3 \xB1 5.1% all conditions compounded, P >\
  \ 0.05). Potentiated twitch torque decreased post set 1 in all conditions (all P\
  \ < 0.05) with greater reductions following each set in SH compared with NM but\
  \ not MH (end-exercise reductions 41.3 \xB1 3.0% vs. 28.0 \xB1 3.2%, P < 0.05 and\
  \ 32.1 \xB1 3.3%, P > 0.05). In conclusion, severe hypoxia exacerbates both peripheral\
  \ fatigue development and performance decrements during maximal, intermittent, dynamic\
  \ leg extensions. In contrast to observations with other exercise modes, during\
  \ exercise involving a single muscle group the attenuation of central motor drive\
  \ does not appear to independently regulate the development of peripheral muscle\
  \ fatigue."
