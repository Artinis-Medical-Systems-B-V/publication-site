abstract: "The purpose of this study was to assess if chronic low back pain patients\
  \ have impaired paraspinal muscle O2 turnover and endurance capacity as compared\
  \ to healthy control subjects during dynamic exercise. Middle-aged healthy male\
  \ subjects (n = 12, control) and male patients with chronic low back pain (n = 17,\
  \ CLBP) participated in the study. L4-L5 level paraspinal muscle fatigue was objectively\
  \ assessed during earlier validated 90 s dynamic back endurance test (spectral EMG,\
  \ MPFslope). Also EMG amplitude (EMG amplitude) and initial MPF (MPFinitial) were\
  \ assessed from the initial 5 s of the endurance contraction. Simultaneously near\
  \ infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used for quantitative measurement of local L4-L5\
  \ paraspinal muscle O2 consumption. Subcutaneous tissue thickness (ATT) was measured\
  \ from the EMG and NIRS recording sites. The results indicated that control and\
  \ CLBP groups were compatible as regarding anthropometric variables, paraspinal\
  \ muscle activation levels (EMGamplitude), initial MPF (MPFinitial) and ATT. When\
  \ the ATT was used as a covariate in the ANOVA analysis, CLBP group did not show\
  \ significantly greater paraspinal muscle fatigability (right MPFslope - 12.2 \xB1\
  \ 10.7%/min, left right MPFslope - 12.6 \xB1 13.3%/min) or O2 consumption (right\
  \ NIRSslope - 52.8 \xB1 79.6 $\u03BC$M/l/s) as compared to healthy controls (right\
  \ MPFslope - 11.9 \xB1 7.6%/min, left MPFslope - 12.7 \xB1 8.6%/min, right NIRSslope\
  \ - 53.7 \xB1 95.2 $\u03BC$M/l/s). As a conclusion, these CLBP male patients did\
  \ not show any impaired rate of paraspinal muscle oxygen consumption or excessive\
  \ paraspinal muscle fatigability during dynamic exercise as compared with healthy\
  \ controls. Subcutaneous tissue thickness has a strong influence on the NIRS and\
  \ EMG amplitude measurements and, if unchecked, it could result in the false interpretation\
  \ of the results. \xA9 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
