abstract: "Single location muscle monitoring does not reflect the heterogeneous activation\
  \ of the muscle group(s) during a given exercise. Vastus lateralis and rectus femoris\
  \ O2 consumption (VO2) was investigated, non-invasively, at rest and during maximal\
  \ voluntary contractions (MVC) using a 12-channel near-infrared continuous wave\
  \ spectroscopy (NIRcws) system (0.1 s acquisition time). VO2 either at rest or during\
  \ MVC was found to be nonuniform in the 11 out of 12 measurement sites over a surface\
  \ of 8 \xD7 8 cm2. As expected, VO2 during exercise was significantly higher than\
  \ VO2 at rest (P < 0.01). However, at each muscle measurement site no difference\
  \ was found between the mean values (n = 12) of VO2 measured during a 5-s intermittent\
  \ MVC and the VO2 values measured during 30-s continuous MVC (P = 0.25). These results\
  \ strengthen the role of NIRcws as a powerful tool for investigating the spatial\
  \ and temporal features of muscle oxygenation changes as well as muscle VO2. \xA9\
