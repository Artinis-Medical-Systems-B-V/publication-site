abstract: "Understanding the effects of acute exercise on executive function in prepubescent\
  \ children may be important for the enhancement of school performance. This study\
  \ assessed the effect of an acute bout of continuous (CONT) or intermittent (INT),\
  \ moderate-intensity treadmill exercise on executive function in young children.\
  \ Twenty healthy children, mean (SD); age: 8.8 (0.8) years; height: 140 (9) cm;\
  \ weight: 36 (11) kg; boys: n\u2009=\u20099, performed a graded-exercise test to\
  \ determine maximal oxygen uptake, and two 15-min submaximal bouts of treadmill\
  \ exercise; protocols were either CONT or INT. During CONT, participants ran at\
  \ 90% of gas exchange threshold. During INT, participants performed six consecutive\
  \ 2.5 min blocks of exercise, which were designed to reflect children's typical\
  \ activity patterns, comprising 45 s at a heavy intensity, 33 s at a moderate intensity,\
  \ 10 s at a severe intensity, and 62 s at a low intensity. Participants performed\
  \ the Stroop task before the submaximal exercise bouts and after, at 1-, 15-, and\
  \ 30-min intervals. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measured cerebral perfusion\
  \ and oxygenation. Regardless of condition, Stroop performance was improved at 1\
  \ min after compared to before, 54.9 (9.8) s versus 57.9 (11) s, respectively, p\u2009\
  <\u2009.01, and improvements were maintained until 30 min after. NIRS (oxyhemoglobin,\
  \ total hemoglobin) explained a significant amount of variance in the change in\
  \ Stroop performance for INT only (49%, p\u2009<\u2009.05). An acute bout of exercise,\
  \ of either an intermittent or continuous nature, improves executive function in\
  \ children, and effects are maintained for\u2009\u2264\u200930 min following exercise\
  \ cessation. Accordingly, it is recommended that children should engage in physical\
  \ activity during periods of school recess."
