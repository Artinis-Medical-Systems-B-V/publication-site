abstract: "Dr. Background-Inorganic nitrate (NO3-), abundant in certain vegetables,\
  \ is converted to nitrite by bacteria in the oral cavity. Nitrite can be converted\
  \ to nitric oxide in the setting of hypoxia. We tested the hypothesis that NO3-\
  \ supplementation improves exercise capacity in heart failure with preserved ejection\
  \ fraction via specific adaptations to exercise. Methods and Results-Seventeen subjects\
  \ participated in this randomized, double-blind, crossover study comparing a single\
  \ dose of NO3-rich beetroot juice (NO3-, 12.9 mmol) with an identical nitrate-depleted\
  \ placebo. Subjects performed supine-cycle maximal-effort cardiopulmonary exercise\
  \ tests, with measurements of cardiac output and skeletal muscle oxygenation. We\
  \ also assessed skeletal muscle oxidative function. Study end points included exercise\
  \ efficiency (total work/ total oxygen consumed), peak Vo2, total work performed,\
  \ vasodilatory reserve, forearm mitochondrial oxidative function, and augmentation\
  \ index (a marker of arterial wave reflections, measured via radial arterial tonometry).\
  \ Supplementation increased plasma nitric oxide metabolites (median, 326 versus\
  \ 10 $\u03BC$mol/L; P=0.0003), peak Vo2 (12.6\xB13.7 versus 11.6\xB13.1 mL O2min-1kg-1;\
  \ P=0.005), and total work performed (55.6\xB135.3 versus 49.2\xB128.9 kJ; P=0.04).\
  \ However, efficiency was unchanged. NO3- led to greater reductions in systemic\
  \ vascular resistance (-42.4\xB116.6% versus-31.8\xB120.3%; P=0.03) and increases\
  \ in cardiac output (121.2\xB159.9% versus 88.7\xB153.3%; P=0.006) with exercise.\
  \ NO3- reduced aortic augmentation index (132.2\xB116.7% versus 141.4\xB121.9%;\
  \ P=0.03) and tended to improve mitochondrial oxidative function. Conclusions-NO3-\
  \ increased exercise capacity in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction\
  \ by targeting peripheral abnormalities. Efficiency did not change as a result of\
  \ parallel increases in total work and Vo2. NO3- increased exercise vasodilatory\
  \ and cardiac output reserves. NO3- also reduced arterial wave reflections, which\
  \ are linked to left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and remodeling."
