abstract: Immersive virtual reality (iVR) employs head-mounted displays or cave-like
  environments to create a sensory-rich virtual experience that simulates the physical
  presence of a user in a digital space. The technology holds immense promise in neuroscience
  research and therapy. In particular, virtual reality (VR) technologies facilitate
  the development of diverse tasks and scenarios closely mirroring real-life situations
  to stimulate the brain within a controlled and secure setting. It also offers a
  cost-effective solution in providing a similar sense of interaction to users when
  conventional stimulation methods are limited or unfeasible. Although combining iVR
  with traditional brain imaging techniques may be difficult due to signal interference
  or instrumental issues, recent work has proposed the use of functional near infrared
  spectroscopy (fNIRS) in conjunction with iVR for versatile brain stimulation paradigms
  and flexible examination of brain responses. We present a comprehensive review of
  current research studies employing an iVR-fNIRS setup, covering device types, stimulation
  approaches, data analysis methods, and major scientific findings. The literature
  demonstrates a high potential for iVR-fNIRS to explore various types of cognitive,
  behavioral, and motor functions in a fully immersive VR (iVR) environment. Such
  studies should set a foundation for adaptive iVR programs for both training (e.g.,
  in novel environments) and clinical therapeutics (e.g., pain, motor and sensory
  disorders and other psychiatric conditions).
