abstract: "Aerobic exercise enhances the ability to sustain attention (peaking at\
  \ moderate intensities) by stimulating noradrenergic activity, which affects the\
  \ fronto-parietal attention network. Prior exercise studies examining attention\
  \ have focused on the influence of exercise intensity, yet few studies have examined\
  \ the influence of the type of exercise protocol administered. Here, we propose\
  \ that sustained attention is greater during (a) moderate compared to low intensity\
  \ exercise, and (b) moderate intensity exercise administered at a varied-load compared\
  \ to a constant-load but the same overall intensity. To test this hypothesis, we\
  \ recorded attentional focus in twelve male cyclists during a sustained attention\
  \ to response task (SART) in four conditions; at rest, and during exercise at a\
  \ low constant-, moderate constant- and moderate varied-load intensity. The change\
  \ in $\u03B1$-amylase (indicative of the noradrenergic response) from saliva samples\
  \ and activation of the right prefrontal and parietal cortices using near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy were recorded. The findings revealed that moderate intensity exercise\
  \ at a constant-load leads to faster responses and less accuracy in the SART than\
  \ rest and low intensity exercise. Moderate intensity exercise at a variable-load\
  \ leads to even faster responses but with no loss of accuracy in the SART. This\
  \ pattern of results is explained by a larger increase in salivary $\u03B1$-amylase\
  \ during moderate (constant and varied) intensity cycling and higher activation\
  \ in the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex during the varied, but not the constant-load\
  \ condition. In conclusion, we show that, in addition to exercise intensity, the\
  \ type of exercise also has important implications upon attentional focus. While\
  \ moderate intensity exercise generally enhances attentional focus, monotonous exercise\
  \ at a constant-load may mask such benefits."
