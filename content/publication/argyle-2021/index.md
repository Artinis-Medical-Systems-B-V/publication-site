abstract: As Digital Manufacturing transforms traditionally physical work into more
  system-monitoring tasks, new methods are required for understanding people's mental
  workload and prolonged capacity for focused attention. Many physiological measures
  have shown promise for detecting changes in cognitive state, and recent advances
  in sensor technology offer minimally-invasive ways to monitor our cognitive activity.
  Previous research in functional near-infrared spectroscopy, for example, has observed
  changes in cerebral hemodynamic response during periods of high demand within tasks.
  This work investigated the relationships among task demand, fatigue, and attention
  degradation in a sustained attention task, and their effect on heart rate, breathing
  rate, nose temperature and hemodynamic response in the prefrontal cortex and middle
  temporal gyrus. Analysis revealed a small but significant effect of fatigue on heart
  rate relative to baseline, breathing rate and hemodynamic response. Task demand
  had a small but significant effect on breathing rate and nose temperature, both
  relative to baseline, but no difference between levels of demand was observed in
  heart rate or hemodynamic response. Our results provide insight into what physiological
  data can tell us about cognitive state, ability to focus, and the impact of fatigue
  over time.
