abstract: 'Aims and objectives/purpose/research questions: The bilingual advantage
  in executive function (EF) has recently been explored with functional near-infrared
  spectroscopy (fNIRS) technology, but the results are still controversial because
  of the limited statistical analysis. This study aims to fill the gap by replicating
  the existing studies and advancing the statistical analysis.   Design/methodology/approach:  Altogether,
  35 preschoolers (aged between 4.1 and 6.3 years, M age = 5.0 years, SD = 0.59) completed
  the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test—Fourth Edition (PPVT-4) and the Dimensional
  Change Card Sort (DCCS) task. Their behavioral performance and the associated brain
  activities during the three sessions of the DCCS task were measured using fNIRS.
  In addition, they were classified into either Bilingual or Monolingual groups based
  on the PPVT scores.    Data and analysis: t-tests and quadratic regression analyses
  were conducted to examine whether children’s performance in the DCCS was related
  to their bilingualism and whether the changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) in
  the prefrontal regions were related to their bilingualism and performance in the
  DCCS.   Findings/conclusions: The behavioral data analysis indicated no significant
  differences between the monolinguals and bilinguals. However, the fNIRS evidence
  indicated that (1) the monolinguals had to recruit 15 channels to complete the cognitive
  shifting of DCCS tasks, whereas the bilinguals only employed 11; (2) the bilinguals
  had significantly more brain activation with fewer channels in BA 44 than the monolinguals,
  demonstrating more effective executive function.   Originality: This study has advanced
  the statistical analysis of the HbO changes for the cognitive shifting in the DCCS
  by confirming the nonlinear U-shape by quadratic regression a better fit than the
  linear V-shape by GLM.   Significance/implications: This finding implies that early
  bilingual experience has equipped young children with more effective executive function.'
