abstract: "We report a case of testicular torsion in a 14-month old boy. Testicular\
  \ ischemia was suspected based on history and clinical presentations. The patient\
  \ was referred following 24 hours of left acute scrotum. Erythema, swelling and\
  \ tenderness associated with nausea and emesis were present, but the patient was\
  \ not febrile. We used a spatially resolved near-infrared spectroscopy (SR-NIRS)\
  \ device to study and compare the tissue saturation index (TSI) on both right and\
  \ left spermatic cords. The TSI was significantly reduced in the left side. Both\
  \ testicles were surgically explored and the left testis was found non-viable with\
  \ a 1080-degree intravaginal torsion. NIRS monitoring of spermatic cord oxygen saturation\
  \ appears feasible as a non-invasive bedside optical method to identify testicular\
  \ torsion. \xA9 2014 Canadian Urological Association."
