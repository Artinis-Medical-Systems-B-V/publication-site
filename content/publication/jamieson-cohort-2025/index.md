abstract: 'Purpose The pathogenesis of the long-lasting symptoms which can follow
  an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus (‘long covid’) is not fully understood. The
  ‘COroNaVirus post-Acute Long-term EffectS: Constructing an evidENCE base’ (CONVALESCENCE)
  study was established as part of the Longitudinal Health and Wellbeing COVID-19
  UK National Core Study. We performed a deep phenotyping case-control study nested
  within two cohorts (the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children and TwinsUK)
  as part of CONVALESCENCE.  Participants From September 2021 to May 2023, 349 participants
  attended the CONVALESCENCE deep phenotyping clinic at University College London.
  Four categories of participants were recruited: cases of long covid (long covid(+)/SARS-CoV-2(+)),
  alongside three control groups: those with neither long covid symptoms nor evidence
  of prior COVID-19 (long covid(-)/SARS-CoV-2(-); control group 1), those who self-reported
  COVID-19 and had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but did not report long covid
  (long covid(-)/SARS-CoV-2(+); control group 2) and those who self-reported persistent
  symptoms attributable to COVID-19 but no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (long
  covid(+)/SARS-CoV-2(-); control group 3). Remote wearable measurements were performed
  up until February 2024.  Findings to date This cohort profile describes the baseline
  characteristics of the CONVALESCENCE cohort. Of the 349 participants, 141 (53±15
  years old; 21 (15%) men) were cases, 89 (55±16 years old; 11 (12%) men) were in
  control group 1, 75 (49±15 years old; 25 (33%) men) were in control group 2 and
  44 (55±16 years old; 9 (21%) men) were in control group 3.  Future plans The study
  aims to use a multiorgan score calculated as the cumulative total for each of nine
  domains (ie, lung, vascular, heart, kidney, brain, autonomic function, muscle strength,
  exercise capacity and physical performance). The availability of data preceding
  acute COVID-19 infection in cohorts may help identify the consequences of infection
  independent of pre-existing subclinical disease and also provide evidence of determinants
  that influence the development of long covid.'
