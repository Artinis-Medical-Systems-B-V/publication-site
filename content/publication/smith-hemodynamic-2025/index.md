abstract: Purpose This study aimed to examine the impact of cold water immersion (CWI)
  on balance and the corresponding hemodynamic responses that occur within the prefrontal
  cortex (PFC). Measuring PFC activation during balance will identify cognitive mechanisms
  underlying postural control, which can be used to identify balance impairments or
  fall risk. Methods Twenty-three participants completed two separate testing visits
  consisting of a 10-min CWI at 15 °C and thermoneutral water immersion (TWI) at 35
  °C. A 30-s eyes-closed balance assessment was performed pre- and post-exposure to
  identify changes in Path Length, Sway Range, and Sway Velocity. Oxygenated (O2Hb)
  and deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb) were measured over the PFC using functional near-infrared
  spectroscopy during all balance assessments. Results There were no detectable differences
  for Sex in any variable, nor significant differences in Path Length (p = 0.94),
  Sway Range (p = 0.92), and Sway Velocity (p = 0.81) between the CWI and TWI exposures.
  For the TWI, there were no differences in O2Hb (p = 0.15) or HHb (p = 0.28) between
  the pre- and post-exposure balance assessments. The CWI exposure resulted in a significant
  decrease in O2Hb (p ≤ 0.01) and an increase in HHb (p ≤ 0.01). Conclusion The demands
  of thermoregulation and balance maintenance following CWI resulted in distinct cerebral
  hemodynamic patterns which potentially reflected increased neural demand during
  the tasks. Increase in HHb and decrease in O2Hb suggest a unique response during
  the refractory period between the CWI and balance assessment that may reflect competing
  thermoregulatory processes associated with rewarming.
