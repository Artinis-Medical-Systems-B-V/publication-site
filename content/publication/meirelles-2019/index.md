abstract: L-arginine is used as a nitric oxide related supplement intended to improve
  sports performance, and to enhance muscular recovery during exercise. However, the
  literature is inconclusive. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of
  acute oral L-arginine supplementation on O2 consumption kinetics and local muscle
  blood volume and oxygenation during treadmill running at two different intensities.
  Using a double-blind, crossover and placebo-controlled design, 11 young healthy
  male adults were randomly assigned to 6 g of L-arginine (ARG) or placebo (PLA) supplementation
  that was ingested 60 min before the exercise test. Tests consisted of treadmill
  run at two different intensities (5 min each; moderate, 90% of ventilatory threshold,
  VT; and heavy, 50% of the difference between VT and VO2peak) interspersed by 1-min
  walking. Respiratory gas exchange variables were measured continuously with an automated
  metabolic cart. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to continuously monitor
  muscle oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin and total hemoglobin. Blood samples were
  collected before supplementation and 6 min after exercise. Two-way repeated measures
  ANOVA did not show differences in plasma nitrite concentrations between ARG or PLA
  conditions during the running tests. No significant differences were observed between
  ARG and PLA conditions for O2 kinetics as well as for NIRS variables. ARG supplementation
  does not improve physiological responses associated with oxygen cost and NIRS variables
  during running treadmill tests. Hence, our results do not support the use of L-arginine
  as an ergogenic aid for running performance in young healthy males.
