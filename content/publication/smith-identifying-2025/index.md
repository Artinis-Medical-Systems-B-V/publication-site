abstract: 'Introduction Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant health concern,
  particularly in military and sports settings. This study investigated the use of
  functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to identify TBI in Role of Care (ROC)
  1 and 2 environments. This initial study aimed to begin the development of a rapid,
  noninvasive neuroimaging technique for assessing brain injuries in field settings.
  Material and Methods Twelve participants, who were all Division 1 athletes, volunteered
  for this study (age: 21.1 ± 2.7 years). A 4 × 1 optode to receiver fNIRS grid was
  placed over the injured and un-injured region of the brain (control) while performing
  a 60-second simple reaction time test. These assessments were collected within the
  first 24  hours of injury, when the team’s physician cleared the participant for
  return to activity (RTA) and return to play (RTP). All testing were performed in
  ROC 1 or 2 environments. A Morlet wavelet fNIRS analysis approach was then used
  to rapidly interpret data in field-based environments. Results The Morlet wavelet
  fNIRS analysis identified the injured brain region. The injured region exhibited
  72% greater tHb (P = .013), 2.6-fold increase in O2Hb (P = .018), and 1.3-fold increase
  in hHb compared to the control region (P = .006). The average time from the initial
  point of injury to being cleared for RTP was 4.3 ± 2.7 weeks. The average of the
  simple reaction time test exhibited a decrease in reaction time from initial and
  RTA at the RTP timepoint (P = .016). Conclusion The Morlet wavelet fNIRS analysis
  identified the injured region of the brain at initial, RTA, and RTP timepoints in
  ROC 1 and 2 environments. It did not detect differences in recovery, but there was
  an improvement in simple reaction time. Thus, the fNIRS analysis detected TBI’s
  in ROC 1 and 2, but further development is needed to increase its sensitivity to
  tracking TBI’s over time.'
