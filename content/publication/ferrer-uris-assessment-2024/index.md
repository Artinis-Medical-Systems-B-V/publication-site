abstract: Climbing performance is greatly dependent on the endurance of the finger
  flexors which, in turn, depends on the ability to deliver and use oxygen within
  the muscle. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and diffuse correlation spectroscopy
  (DCS) have provided new possibilities to explore these phenomena in the microvascular
  environment. The aim of the present study was to explore climbing-related microvascular
  adaptations through the comparison of the oxygen concentration and hemodynamics
  of the forearm between climbers and non-climber active individuals during a vascular
  occlusion test (VOT). Seventeen climbers and fifteen non-climbers joined the study.
  Through NIRS and DCS, the oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb) and deoxyhemoglobin (HHb) concentrations,
  tissue saturation index (TSI), and blood flow index (BFI) were obtained from the
  flexor digitorum profundus during the VOT. During the reactive hyperemia, climbers
  presented greater blood flow slopes (p = 0.043, d = 0.573), as well as greater O2Hb
  maximum values (p = 0.001, d = 1.263) and HHb minimum values (p = 0.009, d = 0.998),
  than non-climbers. The superior hemodynamics presented by climbers could indicate
  potential training-induced structural and functional adaptations that could enhance
  oxygen transportation to the muscle, and thus enhance muscle endurance and climbing
  performance.
