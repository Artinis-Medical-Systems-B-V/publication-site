abstract: "Study Objectives Sleep is altered at high altitude leading many mountaineers\
  \ to use hypnotics in order to improve sleep efficiency. While after a full night\
  \ at altitude the short-acting hypnotic zolpidem does not appear to alter cognitive\
  \ function, residual adverse effects should be considered following early waking-up\
  \ as performed by mountaineers. We hypothesized that zolpidem intake at high altitude\
  \ would alter cognitive function 4 hours after drug intake. Methods In a randomized\
  \ double-blind controlled cross-over study, 22 participants were evaluated during\
  \ two nights at sea level and two nights at 3800 m, 4 hours after zolpidem (10 mg)\
  \ or placebo intake at 10:00 pm. Polygraphic recording was performed until waking-up\
  \ at 01:30 am. Sleep quality, sleepiness and symptoms of acute mountain sickness\
  \ were assessed by questionnaires. Two cognitive tasks (Simon task and duration-production\
  \ task) were performed at rest and during exercise and postural control was evaluated.\
  \ Results Zolpidem increased reaction time in all conditions (zolpidem 407 \xB1\
  \ 9 ms vs. placebo 380 \xB1 11 ms; p < 0.001) and error rate in incongruent trials\
  \ only (10.2 \xB1 1.1% vs. 7.8 \xB1 0.8%; p < 0.01) in the Simon task and increased\
  \ time perception variability (p < 0.001). Zolpidem also altered postural parameters\
  \ (e.g. center of pressure area, zolpidem 236 \xB1 171.5 mm 2 vs. placebo 119.6\
  \ \xB1 59 mm 2; p < 0.001). Zolpidem did not affect apnea-hypopnea index and mean\
  \ arterial oxygen saturation (p > 0.05) but increased sleep quality (p < 0.001).\
  \ Zolpidem increased symptoms of acute mountain sickness and sleepiness (p < 0.05).\
  \ Conclusions Acute zolpidem intake at high altitude alters cognitive functions\
  \ and postural control during early wakening which may be deleterious for safety\
  \ and performances of climbers."
