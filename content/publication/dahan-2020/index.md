abstract: "Individuals with ASD have been shown to have different pattern of functional\
  \ connectivity. In this study, brain activity of participants with many and few\
  \ autistic traits, was recorded using an fNIRS device, as participants preformed\
  \ an interpersonal synchronization task. This type of task involves synchronization\
  \ and functional connectivity of different brain regions. A novel method for assessing\
  \ signal complexity, using $\u03B5$-complexity coefficients, applied for the first\
  \ i.e. on fNIRS recording, was used to classify brain recording of participants\
  \ with many/few autistic traits. Successful classification was achieved implying\
  \ that this method may be useful for classification of fNIRS recordings and that\
  \ there is a difference in brain activity between participants with low and high\
  \ autistic traits as they perform an interpersonal synchronization task."
