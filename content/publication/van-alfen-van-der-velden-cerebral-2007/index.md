abstract: "The aim of our study was to assess consecutive changes in cerebral oxygenation\
  \ and hemodynamics after serial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage from a subcutaneous\
  \ ventricular catheter reservoir (SVCR) in infants with PHVD. Infants with PHVD\
  \ were studied during CSF drainage from a SVCR on the day of SVCR placement, half\
  \ a week and one week after SVCR placement. Changes in cHbD and CBV were assessed\
  \ using near infrared spectrophotometry. Time averaged peak flow velocity (TAPFV),\
  \ end diastolic flow velocity (EDFV), peak systolic flow velocity (PSFV) and pulsatility\
  \ index (PI) were measured before (baseline) and after CSF drainage using Doppler\
  \ ultrasound. Longitudinal data analysis was performed using linear mixed models.\
  \ Seven patients (GA 26.7-40.4 weeks, BW 800-4575 g) were studied. CSF drainage\
  \ resulted in a statistically significant increase in CBV during each measurement.\
  \ The change in CBV was maximal on the day of SVCR placement. A significant increase\
  \ in cHbD and EDFV, and decrease in PI was observed after CSF drainage only on the\
  \ day of SVCR placement. Baseline values of all Doppler variables improved consecutively\
  \ after serial CSF removal in the first week after SVCR placement. Frequent CSF\
  \ drainage results in consecutive improvement of cerebral perfusion and oxygenation\
  \ in infants with PHVD. \xA9 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
