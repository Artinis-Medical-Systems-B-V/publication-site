abstract: Background Behavioral and cognitive control are vital for healthy eating
  behavior. Patients with binge eating disorder (BED) suffer under recurrent binge
  eating episodes accompanied by subjective loss of control that results, among other
  factors, from increased impulsivity. Methods In the current study, we investigated
  the frontal network using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during a
  food specific go/nogo task to assess response inhibition in 24 patients with BED
  (BMI range 22.6-59.7 kg/m2) compared to 12 healthy controls (HC) (BMI range 20.9-27
  kg/m2). Patients with BED were invited to undergo fNIRS measurements before an impulsivity-focused
  cognitive behavioral group treatment, directly after this treatment and 3 months
  afterwards. As this was a planned subgroup analysis of the randomized controlled
  IMPULS trial, patients with BED were randomized either to the treatment group (n=14)
  or to a control group (n=10). The treatment group received 8 weekly sessions of
  the IMPULS treatment. Results We found a significant response inhibition effect
  (nogo minus go), in terms of an increased oxygenated hemoglobin response in the
  bilateral prefrontal cortex in both groups. The greatest response was observed when
  participants were instructed to go for healthy and withhold their response to unhealthy
  high caloric food cues. The healthy nogo condition failed to show a significant
  prefrontal inhibitory response, which was probably related to the task design, as
  the condition was considered more demanding. BED patients, especially those with
  higher trait impulsivity, showed a weaker activation of the prefrontal cortex during
  response inhibition, predominantly in the right hemisphere. Interestingly, three
  months after the treatment, patients of the treatment group increased their right
  prefrontal cortex activity during response inhibition. Likewise, increased prefrontal
  cortex activation correlated with decreased trait impulsivity after treatment. Conclusions
  Our results suggest that patients with BED have limited resources to activate the
  prefrontal cortex when asked to inhibit a reaction onto food-specific stimuli. However,
  this effect could be partly driven by differences in BMI between the HC and BED
  group. Cognitive-behavioral therapy targeting impulsive eating behavior may improve
  prefrontal cortex recruitment during response inhibition.
