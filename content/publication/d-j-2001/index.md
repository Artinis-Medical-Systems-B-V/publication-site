abstract: "In the elderly, standing can frequently be accompanied by blood pressure\
  \ (BP) changes and cerebral symptoms such as dizziness, fall, or even syncope, but\
  \ this may vary from day-to-day. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the reproducibility\
  \ of orthostatic responses of cerebral cortical oxygenation and systemic haemodynamics\
  \ in elderly subjects. In 27 healthy elderly subjects (age 70-84 years), changes\
  \ in systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), heart rate (HR) and stroke volume (SV)\
  \ were continuously monitored by Finapres (Finger Arterial Pressure), and changes\
  \ in oxyhaemoglobin ([O2Hb]) and deoxyhaemoglobin ([HHb]) concentrations were continuously\
  \ measured over the right frontal cortex by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during\
  \ supine rest and 10 min of active standing on two separate occasions. SBP and DBP\
  \ increased by 6.7 \xB1 15.4 mmHg (P<0.05, mean \xB1 SD) and 8.2 \xB1 6.4 mmHg (P<0.01),\
  \ respectively, whereas HR increased by 9.5 \xB1 5.0 bpm (P<0.01) and SV decreased\
  \ by -8.3 \xB1 7.4 ml (P<0.01) during standing on the first occasion. [O2Hb] decreased\
  \ by -3.9 \xB1 2.9 $\u03BC$mol 1-1 (P<0.01), while [HHb] increased by 1.8 \xB1 2.2\
  \ $\u03BC$mol 1-1 (P<0.01). Group-averaged orthostatic changes in cortical oxygenation\
  \ and systemic haemodynamics were very similar on the two occasions, although an\
  \ intraindividual variation was found. Cortical oxygenation changes were not accompanied\
  \ by severe cerebral symptoms. Active standing induced reproducible group-averaged\
  \ frontal cortical oxygenation declines in healthy elderly subjects, although an\
  \ intraindividual day-to-day variability was present, possibly related to the variability\
  \ of orthostatic BP responses. These findings indicate that cerebral autoregulation\
  \ fails to compensate completely for postural changes in elderly subjects, which\
  \ might predispose elderly subjects to ischaemic cerebral symptoms."
