abstract: "Purpose: The current study sought to investigate the role of recovery intensity\
  \ on the physiological and perceptual responses during cycling-based aerobic high-intensity\
  \ interval training. Methods: Fourteen well-trained cyclists (V\u02D9 O 2peak: 62\
  \ \xB1 9\_mL\_kg\u22121\_min\u22121) completed seven laboratory visits. At visit\
  \ 1, the participants' peak oxygen consumption (V\u02D9 O 2peak) and lactate thresholds\
  \ were determined. At visits 2\u20137, participants completed either a 6 \xD7 4\_\
  min or 3 \xD7 8\_min high-intensity interval training (HIIT) protocol with one of\
  \ three recovery intensity prescriptions: passive (PA) recovery, active recovery\
  \ at 80% of lactate threshold (80A) or active recovery at 110% of lactate threshold\
  \ (110A). Results: The time spent at > 80%, > 90% and > 95% of maximal minute power\
  \ during the work intervals was significantly increased with PA recovery, when compared\
  \ to both 80A and 110A, during both HIIT protocols (all P \u2264 0.001). However,\
  \ recovery intensity had no effect on the time spent at > 90% V\u02D9 O 2peak (P\
  \ = 0.11) or > 95% V\u02D9 O 2peak (P = 0.50) during the work intervals of both\
  \ HIIT protocols. Session RPE was significantly higher following the 110A recovery,\
  \ when compared to the PA and 80A recovery during both HIIT protocols (P < 0.001).\
  \ Conclusion: Passive recovery facilitates a higher work interval PO and similar\
  \ internal stress for a lower sRPE when compared to active recovery and therefore\
  \ may be the efficacious recovery intensity prescription."
