abstract: Understanding the depth of penetration of near-infrared (NIR) light in biological
  tissue is critical for enhancing clinical applications of near-infrared spectroscopy
  (NIRS). The current knowledge of NIRS penetration depth primarily stems from mathematical
  models, numerical simulations, and phantom studies, with a notable knowledge gap
  derived from real animal models. By sequentially obstructing light from traversing
  in a porcine kidney tissue model, we derived the depth distribution of NIR light
  experimentally and better characterized its dependence on the distance between the
  light source and photodetector. We collected four replicates of data from six different
  source-detector distances (SDSs) and found that both the maximum and mean depths
  of penetration of NIRS increase with the SDS. Linear relationships can be derived
  between the SDS and the maximum depth, and the square root of the SDS and the mean
  depth.
