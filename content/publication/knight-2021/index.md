abstract: "In this cross-sectional study, the relationship between noninvasively measured\
  \ neurocardiovascular signal entropy and physical frailty was explored in a sample\
  \ of community-dwelling older adults from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing\
  \ (TILDA). The hypothesis under investigation was that dysfunction in the neurovascular\
  \ and cardiovascular systems, as quantified by short-length signal complexity during\
  \ a lying-to-stand test (active stand), could provide a marker for frailty. Frailty\
  \ status (i.e., \u201Cnon-frail\u201D, \u201Cpre-frail\u201D, and \u201Cfrail\u201D\
  ) was based on Fried's criteria (i.e., exhaustion, unexplained weight loss, weakness,\
  \ slowness, and low physical activity). Approximate entropy (ApEn) and sample entropy\
  \ (SampEn) were calculated during resting (lying down), active standing, and recovery\
  \ phases. There was continuously measured blood pressure/heart rate data from 2645\
  \ individuals (53.0% female) and frontal lobe tissue oxygenation data from 2225\
  \ participants (52.3% female); both samples had a mean (SD) age of 64.3 (7.7) years.\
  \ Results revealed statistically significant associations between neurocardiovascular\
  \ signal entropy and frailty status. Entropy differences between non-frail and pre-frail/frail\
  \ were greater during resting state compared with standing and recovery phases.\
  \ Compared with ApEn, SampEn seemed to have better discriminating power between\
  \ non-frail and pre-frail/frail individuals. The quantification of entropy in short\
  \ length neurocardiovascular signals could provide a clinically useful marker of\
  \ the multiple physiological dysregulations that underlie physical frailty."
