 abstract = {Background
The aim of this study was to explore the effects of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) associated with high-intensity exercise on heart rate (HR) and oxygen uptake (V̇O2) recovery kinetics in in patients with coexistence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart failure (HF).

Methods
This is a randomized, double blinded, sham-controlled study involving 14 HF-COPD patients, who underwent a lung function test and Doppler echocardiography. On two different days, patients performed incremental cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and two constant-work rate tests (80% of CPET peak) receiving Sham or NIPPV (bilevel mode - Astral 150) in a random order until the limit of tolerance (Tlim). During exercise, oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin were assessed using near-infrared spectroscopy (Oxymon, Artinis Medical Systems, Einsteinweg, Netherland).

Results
The kinetic variables of both V̇O2 and HR during the high-intensity constant workload protocol were significantly faster in the NIPPV protocol compared to Sham ventilation (P \textless 0.05). Also, there was a marked improvement in oxygenation and lower deoxygenation of both peripheral and respiratory musculature in TLim during NIPPV when contrasted with Sham ventilation.

Conclusions
NIPPV applied during high-intensity dynamic exercise can effectively improve exercise tolerance, accelerate HR and V̇O2 kinetics, improve respiratory and peripheral muscle oxygenation in COPD-HF patients. These beneficial results from the effects of NIPPV may provide evidence and a basis for high-intensity physical training for these patients in cardiopulmonary rehabilitation programs.},
