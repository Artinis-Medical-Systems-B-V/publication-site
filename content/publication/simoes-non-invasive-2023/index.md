abstract: Background The aim of this study was to explore the effects of non-invasive
  positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) associated with high-intensity exercise on
  heart rate (HR) and oxygen uptake (V̇O2) recovery kinetics in in patients with coexistence
  of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart failure (HF).  Methods
  This is a randomized, double blinded, sham-controlled study involving 14 HF-COPD
  patients, who underwent a lung function test and Doppler echocardiography. On two
  different days, patients performed incremental cardiopulmonary exercise testing
  (CPET) and two constant-work rate tests (80% of CPET peak) receiving Sham or NIPPV
  (bilevel mode - Astral 150) in a random order until the limit of tolerance (Tlim).
  During exercise, oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin were assessed using near-infrared
  spectroscopy (Oxymon, Artinis Medical Systems, Einsteinweg, Netherland).  Results
  The kinetic variables of both V̇O2 and HR during the high-intensity constant workload
  protocol were significantly faster in the NIPPV protocol compared to Sham ventilation
  (P textless 0.05). Also, there was a marked improvement in oxygenation and lower
  deoxygenation of both peripheral and respiratory musculature in TLim during NIPPV
  when contrasted with Sham ventilation.  Conclusions NIPPV applied during high-intensity
  dynamic exercise can effectively improve exercise tolerance, accelerate HR and V̇O2
  kinetics, improve respiratory and peripheral muscle oxygenation in COPD-HF patients.
  These beneficial results from the effects of NIPPV may provide evidence and a basis
  for high-intensity physical training for these patients in cardiopulmonary rehabilitation
  programs.
