abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Aerobatic pilots must withstand high and sudden acceleration
  forces (G z ) up to 10 G z . The physiological consequences of such a succession
  of high and abrupt positive and negative G z on the human body over time remain
  mostly unknown. This case report emphasizes changes in physiological factors such
  as cerebral oxygenation and heart rate dynamics collected in real aerobatic flights.
  CASE REPORT: A 37-yr-old man, experienced in aerobatic flying, voluntarily took
  part in this study. During two flight runs (1520 min), the pilot performed aerobatic
  maneuvers with multiple high (10 G z ) positive and negative accelerations. During
  the flights he wore a Polar heart rate sensor while cerebral oxygenation was measured
  continuously over his prefrontal cortex via near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). NIRS
  allows for measurement of the relative concentration changes of oxygenated hemoglobin
  (O 2 Hb) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb), making it possible to determine cerebral
  oxygenation and hemodynamic status. DISCUSSION: The continuous in-flight monitoring
  of O 2 Hb and HHb revealed the large effects of successive positive and negative
  G z exposures on cerebral hemodynamics alterations. The results showed a significant
  and positive correlation between changes in G z exposures and O 2 Hb concentration.
  This case report highlights that NIRS provides some valuable and sensitive indicators
  for the monitoring of cerebral hemodynamics during aerobatic flights exposed to
  multiple and high acceleration forces. To our knowledge, this first study quantifying
  cerebral oxygenation changes in aerobatics opens the way for the assessment of individual
  physiological responses and tolerance in pilots to repeated high G z during real
  flights.  Fresnel E, Dray G, Pla S, Jean P, Belda G, Perrey S. Cerebral oxygenation
