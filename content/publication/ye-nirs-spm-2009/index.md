abstract: "Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive method to measure brain\
  \ activity via changes in the degree of hemoglobin oxygenation through the intact\
  \ skull. As optically measured hemoglobin signals strongly correlate with BOLD signals,\
  \ simultaneous measurement using NIRS and fMRI promises a significant mutual enhancement\
  \ of temporal and spatial resolutions. Although there exists a powerful statistical\
  \ parametric mapping tool in fMRI, current public domain statistical tools for NIRS\
  \ have several limitations related to the quantitative analysis of simultaneous\
  \ recording studies with fMRI. In this paper, a new public domain statistical toolbox\
  \ known as NIRS-SPM is described. It enables the quantitative analysis of NIRS signal.\
  \ More specifically, NIRS data are statistically analyzed based on the general linear\
  \ model (GLM) and Sun's tube formula. The p-values are calculated as the excursion\
  \ probability of an inhomogeneous random field on a representation manifold that\
  \ is dependent on the structure of the error covariance matrix and the interpolating\
  \ kernels. NIRS-SPM not only enables the calculation of activation maps of oxy-,\
  \ deoxy-hemoglobin and total hemoglobin, but also allows for the super-resolution\
  \ localization, which is not possible using conventional analysis tools. Extensive\
  \ experimental results using finger tapping and memory tasks confirm the viability\
  \ of the proposed method. \xA9 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
