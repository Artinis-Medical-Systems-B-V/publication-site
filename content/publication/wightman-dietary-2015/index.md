abstract: "Nitrate derived from vegetables is consumed as part of a normal diet and\
  \ is reduced endogenously via nitrite to nitric oxide. It has been shown to improve\
  \ endothelial function, reduce blood pressure and the oxygen cost of sub-maximal\
  \ exercise, and increase regional perfusion in the brain. The current study assessed\
  \ the effects of dietary nitrate on cognitive performance and prefrontal cortex\
  \ cerebral blood-flow (CBF) parameters in healthy adults. In this randomised, double-blind,\
  \ placebo-controlled, parallel-groups study, 40 healthy adults received either placebo\
  \ or 450. ml beetroot juice ($\u223C$. 5.5. mmol nitrate). Following a 90. minute\
  \ drink/absorption period, participants performed a selection of cognitive tasks\
  \ that activate the frontal cortex for 54. min. Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS)\
  \ was used to monitor CBF and hemodynamics, as indexed by concentration changes\
  \ in oxygenated and deoxygenated-haemoglobin, in the frontal cortex throughout.\
  \ The bioconversion of nitrate to nitrite was confirmed in plasma by ozone-based\
  \ chemi-luminescence. Dietary nitrate modulated the hemodynamic response to task\
  \ performance, with an initial increase in CBF at the start of the task period,\
  \ followed by consistent reductions during the least demanding of the three tasks\
  \ utilised. Cognitive performance was improved on the serial 3s subtraction task.\
  \ These results show that single doses of dietary nitrate can modulate the CBF response\
  \ to task performance and potentially improve cognitive performance, and suggest\
  \ one possible mechanism by which vegetable consumption may have beneficial effects\
  \ on brain function."
