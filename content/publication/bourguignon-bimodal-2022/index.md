abstract: Neuroergonomics focuses on the brain signatures and associated mental states
  underlying behavior to design human-machine interfaces enhancing performance in
  the cognitive and physical domains. Brain imaging techniques such as functional
  near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) have been considered
  key methods for achieving this goal. Recent research stresses the value of combining
  EEG and fNIRS in improving these interface systems' mental state decoding abilities,
  but little is known about whether these improvements generalize over different paradigms
  and methodologies, nor about the potentialities for using these systems in the real
  world. We review 33 studies comparing mental state decoding accuracy between bimodal
  EEG-fNIRS and unimodal EEG and fNIRS in several subdomains of neuroergonomics. In
  light of these studies, we also consider the challenges of exploiting wearable versions
  of these systems in real-world contexts. Overall the studies reviewed suggest that
  bimodal EEG-fNIRS outperforms unimodal EEG or fNIRS despite major differences in
  their conceptual and methodological aspects. Much work however remains to be done
  to reach practical applications of bimodal EEG-fNIRS in naturalistic conditions.
  We consider these points to identify aspects of bimodal EEG-fNIRS research in which
  progress is expected or desired.
