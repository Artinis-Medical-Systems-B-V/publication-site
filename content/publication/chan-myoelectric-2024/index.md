abstract: 'Robot-assisted bilateral arm training has demonstrated its effectiveness
  in improving motor function in individuals post-stroke, showing significant enhancements
  with increased repetitions. However, prolonged training sessions may lead to both
  mental and muscle fatigue. We conducted two types of robot-assisted bimanual wrist
  exercises on 16 healthy adults, separated by one week: long-duration, low-resistance
  workouts and short-duration, high-resistance exercises. Various measures, including
  surface electromyograms, near-infrared spectroscopy, heart rate, and the Borg Rating
  of Perceived Exertion scale, were employed to assess fatigue levels and the impacts
  of exercise intensity. High-resistance exercise resulted in a more pronounced decline
  in electromyogram median frequency and recruited a greater amount of hemoglobin,
  indicating increased muscle fatigue and a higher metabolic demand to cope with the
  intensified workload. Additionally, high-resistance exercise led to increased sympathetic
  activation and a greater sense of exertion. Conversely, engaging in low-resistance
  exercises proved beneficial for reducing post-exercise muscle stiffness and enhancing
  muscle elasticity. Choosing a low-resistance setting for robot-assisted wrist movements
  offers advantages by alleviating mental and physiological loads. The reduced training
  intensity can be further optimized by enabling extended exercise periods while maintaining
  an approximate dosage compared to high-resistance exercises.'
