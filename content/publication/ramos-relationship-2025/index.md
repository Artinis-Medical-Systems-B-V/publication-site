abstract: 'Learning a visuomotor adaptation task (VMA) is typically assessed by describing
  the behavioral changes during adaption (early-fast and late-slow phases) and retention
  (consolidation) tests. Few studies have concurrently examined behavioral and brain
  activity during this type of learning and therefore their time-dependent dynamics
  is unknown. It has been proposed that two distinct strategies can be used during
  such learning: a model-free and a model-based, which distinctively involved explicit
  and implicit learning strategies. It has also been proposed that prefrontal cortex
  (PFC) is more implicated when explicit processes are more relevant as it was observed
  in the early adaptation (Taylor & Ivry, 2014; Wolpe et al., 2020). Additionally,
  an explicit model-based strategy has been inferred when prefrontal (PFC) activity
  increases. Therefore, the study´s aims were: (1) to examine the continuous temporal
  dynamics of behavior and right PFC activity during adaptation and retention of a
  VMA, and (2) to infer the implication of explicit processes during the learning
  of a VMA derived from right PFC activity. Eighteen young adults (24.22 ± 3.12 years)
  took part in this study. Continuous measures of the performance (the initial directional
  error, IDE, and the root mean square error, RMSE) of a rotational visuomotor adaptation
  task during an adaptation (AD) and two retention sets at 1 h (RT1) and 24 h (RT24)
  were collected. Concurrently, measures of the right PFC activity (relative changes
  of the oxyhemoglobin concentration, [ΔO2Hb]) were registered via a three-channel
  functional near-infrared spectroscopy device. General linear mixed models were run
  to explore differences across adaptation and retentions. Also, cross-correlations
  between performance (IDE and RMSE) and PFC activity were conducted to observe their
  relation during sets. The main results indicated that (1) initial fast behavioral
  improvement (decrease of IDE and RMSE) did not occur simultaneously with the largest
  increase of the [ΔO2Hb] in the PFC during the AD, and (2) there was similar performance
  in the RT1 and RT24 but possibly involving the PFC differently. While in both retentions
  the errors improved after the first trials, in RT1, the [ΔO2Hb] decreased from the
  very beginning, whereas the PFC activity initially increased in RT24. Our observations
  would suggest that various cooperating learning strategies, including model-free
  (i.e., exploratory) and model-based explicit (i.e., strategy) and implicit (i.e.,
  sensory prediction errors), are coordinated in different timings to cooperate during
  the sensorimotor adaptation and consolidation processes. Furthermore, the involvement
  of these strategies during the retention may depend on the time elapsed from the
  end of the adaptation to the re-introduction of the task.'
