abstract: "To establish the test\u2013retest reliability of pulmonary oxygen uptake\
  \ (V\u0307O2), muscle deoxygenation (deoxy[haem]) and\_tissue oxygen saturation\
  \ (StO2) kinetics in youth elite-cyclists. From baseline pedalling, 15 youth cyclists\
  \ completed 6-min step transitions to a moderate- and heavy-intensity work rate\
  \ separated by 8\_min of baseline cycling. The protocol was repeated after 1\_h\
  \ of passive rest. V\u0307O2 was measured breath-by-breath alongside deoxy[haem]\
  \ and StO2 of the vastus lateralis by near-infrared spectroscopy. Reliability was\
  \ assessed using 95% limits of agreement (LoA), the typical error (TE) and the intraclass\
  \ correlation coefficient (ICC). During moderate- and heavy-intensity step cycling,\
  \ TEs for the amplitude, time delay and time constant ranged between 3.5\u201321.9%\
  \ and 3.9\u201312.1% for V\u0307O2 and between 6.6\u201313.7% and 3.5\u201310.4%\
  \ for deoxy[haem], respectively. The 95% confidence interval for estimating the\
  \ kinetic parameters significantly improved for ensemble-averaged transitions of\
  \ V\u0307O2 (p\_<\_0.01) but not for deoxy[haem]. For StO2, the TEs for the baseline,\
  \ end-exercise and the rate of deoxygenation were 1.0\u201342.5% and 1.1\u20135.5%\
  \ during moderate- and heavy-intensity exercise, respectively. The ICC ranged from\
  \ 0.81 to 0.99 for all measures. Test\u2013retest reliability data provide limits\
  \ within which changes in V\u0307O2, deoxy[haem] and StO2 kinetics may be interpreted\
  \ with confidence in youth athletes."
