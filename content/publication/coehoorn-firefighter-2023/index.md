abstract: This study evaluated the impact of rapid heat stress on prefrontal cortex
  (PFC) oxygenation and hemodynamics. Previous work has demonstrated that heat stress
  affects cerebral oxygenation and hemodynamics. Fourteen male subjects performed
  a graded exercise test to a termination criterion (volitional maximum, core temperature
  = 39.5 °C, or a 2-hour time cap) with (GEAR) and without (NOGEAR) firefighting gear
  in a laboratory with an ambient temperature of 25–26 °C. Changes in oxyhemoglobin
  (O2Hb), total hemoglobin (tHb), and tissue oxygen saturation index (TSI %) were
  monitored in the left and right PFC using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Significant
  NIRS results were a plateau in the left-side O2Hb and tHb at 80 % of the time to
  termination (TTT) in NOGEAR, and 60 % of TTT in GEAR. These TTT points were when
  the subject's core temperature (Tc) was equal to 38 °C. Additionally, there was
  higher left-side PFC activation during GEAR, as indicated by a significant decrease
  in TSI % from start to end of exercise and double the reduction in TSI % per minute
  in PPE compared to NOGEAR. There were no significant differences during the NOGEAR
  session. These data suggest that a rapid heat stress scenario (GEAR) causes altered
  cerebral oxygenation and hemodynamic response in the left-side PFC. The left PFC
  could be working harder to prevent fatigue in GEAR. This could affect cognitive
  processes during or following exercise in the heat while wearing personal protective
  equipment. Our results also support previous research demonstrating that NIRS is
  a sensitive metric of fatigue.
