abstract: "Background Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown\
  \ to perturb both cortical neural activity and hemodynamics during (online) and\
  \ after the stimulation, however mechanisms of these tDCS-induced online and after-effects\
  \ are not known. Here, online resting-state spontaneous brain activation may be\
  \ relevant to monitor tDCS neuromodulatory effects that can be measured using electroencephalography\
  \ (EEG) in conjunction with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Method We present\
  \ a Kalman Filter based online parameter estimation of an autoregressive (ARX) model\
  \ to track the transient coupling relation between the changes in EEG power spectrum\
  \ and NIRS signals during anodal tDCS (2\_mA, 10\_min) using a 4\_\xD7\_1 ring high-definition\
  \ montage. Results Our online ARX parameter estimation technique using the cross-correlation\
  \ between log (base-10) transformed EEG band-power (0.5\u201311.25\_Hz) and NIRS\
  \ oxy-hemoglobin signal in the low frequency (\u22640.1\_Hz) range was shown in\
  \ 5 healthy subjects to be sensitive to detect transient EEG-NIRS coupling changes\
  \ in resting-state spontaneous brain activation during anodal tDCS. Conventional\
  \ sliding window cross-correlation calculations suffer a fundamental problem in\
  \ computing the phase relationship as the signal in the window is considered time-invariant\
  \ and the choice of the window length and step size are subjective. Here, Kalman\
  \ Filter based method allowed online ARX parameter estimation using time-varying\
  \ signals that could capture transients in the coupling relationship between EEG\
  \ and NIRS signals. Conclusion Our new online ARX model based tracking method allows\
  \ continuous assessment of the transient coupling between the electrophysiological\
  \ (EEG) and the hemodynamic (NIRS) signals representing resting-state spontaneous\
  \ brain activation during anodal tDCS."
