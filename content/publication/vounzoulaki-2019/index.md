abstract: 'Objective: This pilot, prospective, observational, cohort study aimed to
  examine, for the first time, the in vivo alterations in the oxygenation of the forearm
  skeletal muscles and the prefrontal lobes during intermittent exercise in women
  diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), during and after pregnancy.
  Study Design: Nine pregnant women, diagnosed with GDM, performed a 3-min intermittent
  handgrip exercise protocol (at 35% of Maximal Voluntary Contraction) during pregnancy
  (mean 27th gestational week) and following labor (mean 71 weeks). During the protocol,
  muscle and cerebral oxygenation were assessed with near-infrared spectroscopy. Resting
  vascular parameters [carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and hemodynamic parameters
  (using rheocardiography)], and hematological/biochemical parameters during pregnancy
  and after delivery have been compared. Results: Although changes were observed in
  certain hematological parameters (p< 0.05), cIMT and hemodynamic parameters were
  not altered post-partum. In addition, both muscle and cerebral oxygenation parameters
  during handgrip were not significantly altered post-partum. Conclusions: Despite
  significant changes in specific hematological parameters in women with GDM, impairments
  in muscle and cerebral oxygenation during exercise remained at one year after labor.
  These results indicate that alterations in vascular parameters and muscle/cerebral
  oxygenation associated with GDM do not entirely reverse post-partum. Future studies
  are needed to examine which interventions will lead to improvements in microvascular
  parameters and prevent type 2 diabetes.'
