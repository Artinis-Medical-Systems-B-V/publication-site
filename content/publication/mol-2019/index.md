abstract: "Purpose: Cerebral oxygenation as measured by near-infrared spectroscopy\
  \ (NIRS) might be useful to discriminate between physiological and pathological\
  \ responses after standing up in individuals with orthostatic hypotension. This\
  \ study addressed the physiological sensitivity of the cerebral oxygenation responses\
  \ as measured by NIRS to different types and speeds of postural changes in healthy\
  \ adults and assessed the reliability of these responses. Methods: Cerebral oxygenated\
  \ hemoglobin (O 2 Hb), deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb) and tissue saturation index\
  \ (TSI) were measured bilaterally on the forehead of 15 healthy individuals (12\
  \ male, age range 18\u201327) using NIRS. Participants performed three repeats of\
  \ sit to stand, and slow and rapid supine to stand movements. Responses were defined\
  \ as the difference between mean, minimum and maximum O 2 Hb, HHb and TSI values\
  \ after standing up and baseline. Test\u2013retest, interobserver and intersensor\
  \ reliabilities were addressed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs).\
  \ Results: The minimum O 2 Hb response was most sensitive to postural changes and\
  \ showed significant differences (\u2212 4.09\_\xB5mol/L, p < 0.001) between standing\
  \ up from sitting and supine position, but not between standing up at different\
  \ speeds (\u2212 0.31\_\xB5mol/L, p = 0.70). The minimum O 2 Hb response was the\
  \ most reliable parameter (ICC > 0.6). Conclusions: In healthy individuals, NIRS-based\
  \ cerebral oxygenation parameters are sensitive to postural change and discriminate\
  \ between standing up from supine and sitting position with minimum O 2 Hb response\
  \ as the most sensitive and reliable parameter. The results underpin the potential\
  \ value for future clinical use of NIRS in individuals with orthostatic hypotension."
