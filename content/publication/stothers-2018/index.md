abstract: 'INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Control of micturition is dependent upon an
  extensive brain neural network. Cortical activity related to pelvic floor muscle
  (PFM) contractions has been demonstrated using fMRI but is not in routine clinical
  care due to expense, limited access and restriction to the supine position. Functional
  near infra-red spectroscopy (fNIRS) which detects changes in oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb)
  and deoxyhemoglobin (hHb) concentrations is non invasive, maps cortical activity
  in real time and allows upright posture. Objective: examine patterns of frontal
  cortical brain O2Hb using fNIRS during PFM contraction and relaxation at capacity
  and related to voluntary uroflow in natural voiding posture. METHODS: N=12 studies;
  subjects, healthy volunteers, men (age 24-55 yrs), women (age 24-78 yrs). A protocol
  proving PFM control by fMRI was replicated then extended to include spontaneous
  voiding, uroflow and post void residual urine. fNIRS was performed using a 4x4 optode
  grid (Artinis Medical Systems) over the frontal cortex, at 10 Hz. At bladder capacity,
  following natural filling subjects imitated voiding by releasing or imitated interruption
  of voiding by contracting PFMs for 10 sec over 10 repetitions followed by voluntary
  voiding (seated or standing for males). O2Hb and hHb patterns were captured, then
  linked to uroflow in video format. RESULTS: In men and women PFM contraction and
  relaxation induced a repetitive activation pattern in the frontal cortex with increases
  in DO2Hb evident. There was an increase in DO2Hb detectable in the lateral prefrontal
  area (Brodmann''s areas) following permission to void at capacity with urge. Fig
  1: demonstration of cerebral O2Hb static images from fNIRS video before permission
  to void (A), following permission to void (B), at Q max (C) and following voiding
  (D). CONCLUSIONS: A clinical protocol for fNIRS mapping to detect activation of
  the frontal cortical micturition region during voluntary uroflow and during PFM
  is presented for future clinical studies. To our knowledge, this is the first study
  confirming fNIRS activation patterns detected during micturition-related activity
  in cortical structures during natural voiding posture corresponding to those previously
  demonstrated in fMRI.'
