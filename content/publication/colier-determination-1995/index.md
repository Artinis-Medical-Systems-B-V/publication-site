abstract: "The aim of this study was to determine oxygen consumption (VO2) during\
  \ isometric exercise in human muscles using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The\
  \ technique was used to study the relationship between VO2 in the soleus muscle\
  \ and the level of isometric exercise expressed as percentages of the maximum voluntary\
  \ contraction (MVC). For the study 11 healthy male volunteers were recruited. Reproducibility\
  \ was studied in 6 subjects. The subjects were seated in a chair with the knee joint\
  \ at an angle of 90\xB0. The optodes of the NIRS instrument were attached to the\
  \ lateral aspect of the soleus muscle. A horizontal bar above the knee was connected\
  \ to a dynamometer. Subjects applied isometric force to the bar by producing a torque\
  \ at the ankle joint. Firstly the MVC was determined. Secondly the VO2 at rest and\
  \ at 5 levels of isometric exercise, ranging from 5% to 25% of MVC and increasing\
  \ by 5% each stage, was measured. In all cases the VO2 at rest or during isometric\
  \ contraction was determined from the decrease of the oxyhaemoglobin (O2Hb) signal\
  \ immediately after arterial occlusion of the thigh. Repeated measurements showed\
  \ no significant difference between trials, indicating that the measurements were\
  \ reproducible. At rest a VO2 of 6.7 \xB1 1.1 $\u03BC$MO2Hb min\u20101 (mean \xB1\
  \ S.E.M.) was found, a result comparable with other studies. In all subjects a linear\
  \ relationship was found between the VO2 and the level of exercise. The average\
  \ slope of the regression lines of all individuals was 0.85 \xB1 0.22 $\u03BC$uMO,\
  \ Hb min\u20101 MVC\u20101 (mean \xB1 S.E.M.). Inter\u2010individual variation of\
  \ the slopes was high and ranged from 0.28 to 2.29 $\u03BC$uMO2 Hb\u2010 min\u2010\
  1 %MVC\u20101, which can be explained by differences in fat percentage and in the\
  \ measuring volume of the NIRS instrument. NIRS appeared to be a reproducible and\
  \ reliable method for the non\u2010invasive measurement of VO2 in human muscles.\
  \ The method could be used to investigate regional differences as well as changes\
  \ in time between muscle groups as a function of training. Copyright \xA9 1995 Acta\
