 abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine oxygen consumption (VO2) during isometric exercise in human muscles using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The technique was used to study the relationship between VO2 in the soleus muscle and the level of isometric exercise expressed as percentages of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). For the study 11 healthy male volunteers were recruited. Reproducibility was studied in 6 subjects. The subjects were seated in a chair with the knee joint at an angle of 90°. The optodes of the NIRS instrument were attached to the lateral aspect of the soleus muscle. A horizontal bar above the knee was connected to a dynamometer. Subjects applied isometric force to the bar by producing a torque at the ankle joint. Firstly the MVC was determined. Secondly the VO2 at rest and at 5 levels of isometric exercise, ranging from 5% to 25% of MVC and increasing by 5% each stage, was measured. In all cases the VO2 at rest or during isometric contraction was determined from the decrease of the oxyhaemoglobin (O2Hb) signal immediately after arterial occlusion of the thigh. Repeated measurements showed no significant difference between trials, indicating that the measurements were reproducible. At rest a VO2 of 6.7 ± 1.1 $μ$MO2Hb min‐1 (mean ± S.E.M.) was found, a result comparable with other studies. In all subjects a linear relationship was found between the VO2 and the level of exercise. The average slope of the regression lines of all individuals was 0.85 ± 0.22 $μ$uMO, Hb min‐1 MVC‐1 (mean ± S.E.M.). Inter‐individual variation of the slopes was high and ranged from 0.28 to 2.29 $μ$uMO2 Hb‐ min‐1 %MVC‐1, which can be explained by differences in fat percentage and in the measuring volume of the NIRS instrument. NIRS appeared to be a reproducible and reliable method for the non‐invasive measurement of VO2 in human muscles. The method could be used to investigate regional differences as well as changes in time between muscle groups as a function of training. Copyright © 1995 Acta Anaesthesiol Scand},
