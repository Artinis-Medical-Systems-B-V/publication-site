abstract: Purpose The use of blood flow restricted (BFR) running may provide an alternative
  to lower the running speed without compromising physiological responses that often
  occur during high intensity running. The purpose of this investigation was to compare
  the acute effects of various submaximal treadmill running speeds with BFR relative
  to maximal treadmill running speed without BFR on surface electromyographic amplitude
  (sEMGAMP), surface electromyographic mean power frequency (sEMGMPF), and muscle
  tissue oxygenation (StO2) responses.  Methods Thirteen college-aged females randomly
  completed four, three-minute treadmill running bouts at 70%, 80%, and 90% of their
  top speed (achieved during a graded exercise test) with BFR (70%BFR, 80%BFR, and
  90%BFR) and 100% of their top speed without BFR (100%NOBFR). The sEMGAMP, sEMGMPF,
  and StO2 responses were analyzed from the final minute of the treadmill running
  bouts.  Results Each treadmill running bout led to similar (zero present in each
  Bayesian 95% high-density interval) sEMGAMP, sEMGMPF, and StO2 responses (70%BFR = 80%BFR = 90%BFR = 100%NOBFR).
  The mean difference (Meandiff) between speeds ranged from 2.73% to 11.20% for sEMGAMP,
  0.04% to 7.08% for sEMGMPF, and 0.02% to 1.03% for StO2.  Conclusion Despite reductions
  in treadmill running speed, sEMGAMP, sEMGMPF, and StO2 responses were similar among
  non-BFR maximal treadmill running and submaximal treadmill running with BFR. Thus,
  submaximal treadmill running with BFR may serve as a potential alternative when
  maximal intensity aerobic exercise is contraindicated.
