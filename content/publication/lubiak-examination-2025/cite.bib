 abstract = {Purpose
The use of blood flow restricted (BFR) running may provide an alternative to lower the running speed without compromising physiological responses that often occur during high intensity running. The purpose of this investigation was to compare the acute effects of various submaximal treadmill running speeds with BFR relative to maximal treadmill running speed without BFR on surface electromyographic amplitude (sEMGAMP), surface electromyographic mean power frequency (sEMGMPF), and muscle tissue oxygenation (StO2) responses.

Methods
Thirteen college-aged females randomly completed four, three-minute treadmill running bouts at 70%, 80%, and 90% of their top speed (achieved during a graded exercise test) with BFR (70%BFR, 80%BFR, and 90%BFR) and 100% of their top speed without BFR (100%NOBFR). The sEMGAMP, sEMGMPF, and StO2 responses were analyzed from the final minute of the treadmill running bouts.

Results
Each treadmill running bout led to similar (zero present in each Bayesian 95% high-density interval) sEMGAMP, sEMGMPF, and StO2 responses (70%BFR = 80%BFR = 90%BFR = 100%NOBFR). The mean difference (Meandiff) between speeds ranged from 2.73% to 11.20% for sEMGAMP, 0.04% to 7.08% for sEMGMPF, and 0.02% to 1.03% for StO2.

Conclusion
Despite reductions in treadmill running speed, sEMGAMP, sEMGMPF, and StO2 responses were similar among non-BFR maximal treadmill running and submaximal treadmill running with BFR. Thus, submaximal treadmill running with BFR may serve as a potential alternative when maximal intensity aerobic exercise is contraindicated.},
