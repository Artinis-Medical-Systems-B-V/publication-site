abstract: "Frontal lobe activation caused by tasks such as videogames can be investigated\
  \ using multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), sometimes called optical\
  \ topography. The aims of this study are to investigate the effects of video gaming\
  \ (fighting and puzzle games) in the brain and the systemic physiology and to determine\
  \ whether systemic responses during the gaming task are associated with the measurement\
  \ of localised cerebral haemodynamic changes as measured by fNIRS. We used a continuous-wave\
  \ 8-channel fNIRS system to measure the changes in concentration of oxy-haemoglobin\
  \ (HbO<inf>2</inf>) and deoxy-haemoglobin (HHb) and changes in total haemoglobin\
  \ ($\u0394$tHb = $\u0394$HbO<inf>2</inf> + $\u0394$HHb) over the frontal lobe in\
  \ 30 healthy volunteers. The Portapres system was used to measure mean blood pressure\
  \ (MBP) and heart rate (HR), and a laser Doppler was employed to measure the changes\
  \ in scalp blood flow (or flux). Even though we observed significant changes in\
  \ systemic variables during gaming, in particular in scalp flow, we also managed\
  \ to see localised activation patterns over the frontal polar (FP1) region. However,\
  \ in some channels over the frontal lobe, we also observed significant correlations\
  \ between the HbO<inf>2</inf> and systemic variables. \xA9 2013 Springer Science+Business\
