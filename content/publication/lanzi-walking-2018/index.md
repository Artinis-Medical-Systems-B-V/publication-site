abstract: "Background Takayasu arteritis (TAK) is a rare chronic inflammatory vasculitis\
  \ predominantly affecting the aorta and its main branches. Takayasu arteritis has\
  \ been shown to increase cardiovascular risk. Supervised exercise training (SET)\
  \ is a well-recognized and effective therapeutic tool improving walking performances\
  \ in patients with chronic atherosclerotic disease; however, the effects of SET,\
  \ and the underlying mechanisms, remain poorly documented in TAK patients. Case\
  \ summary We reviewed the literature and investigated the effects of a 12-week SET\
  \ programme on walking performances, physical function, and calf muscle oxygen saturation\
  \ (StO2; assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy) during exercise in a 28-year-old\
  \ man with TAK and symptoms of arterial lower limb claudication. The literature\
  \ review evidences only two recent publications suggesting that exercise training\
  \ is effective and well-tolerated in patients with arteritis. The treadmill pain-free\
  \ (\xFE22%) and maximal (\xFE273%) walking distance, 6-min walking distance (\xFE\
  66%), and physical function of lower extremities (\xFE20%) following SET were significantly\
  \ improved in our patient. Moreover, we observed a greater muscle oxygen desaturation\
  \ (increased oxygen extraction) during exercise. Discussion Following SET, the increased\
  \ oxygen extraction may be related to improved microvascular milieu leading to a\
  \ better match between muscle oxygen supply and demand during exercise. These new\
  \ results may contribute to mechanistic insights in peripheral adaptations following\
  \ exercise training in TAK patients and may help to explain, at least partly, the\
  \ increased walking performances. Although more studies are needed to better explore\
  \ the impact of exercise training, these results suggest that exercise should be\
  \ recommended in TAK patients."
