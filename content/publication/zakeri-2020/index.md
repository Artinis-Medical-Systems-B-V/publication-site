abstract: Laparoscopic surgery can be exhausting and frustrating, and the cognitive
  load experienced by surgeons may have a major impact on patient safety as well as
  healthcare economics. As cognitive load decreases with increasing proficiency, its
  robust assessment through physiological data can help to develop more effective
  training and certification procedures in this area. We measured data from 31 novices
  during laparoscopic exercises to extract features based on cardiac and ocular variables.
  These were compared with traditional behavioural and subjective measures in a dual-task
  setting. We found significant correlations between the features and the traditional
  measures. The subjective task difficulty, reaction time, and completion time were
  well predicted by the physiology features. Reaction times to randomly timed auditory
  stimuli were correlated with the mean of the heart rate (r= - 0.29) and heart rate
  variability (r= 0.4). Completion times were correlated with the physiologically
  predicted values with a correlation coefficient of 0.84. We found that the multi-modal
  set of physiology features was a better predictor than any individual feature and
  artificial neural networks performed better than linear regression. The physiological
  correlates studied in this paper, translated into technological products, could
  help develop standardised and more easily regulated frameworks for training and
  certification.
