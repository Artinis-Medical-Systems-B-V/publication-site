abstract: Monitoring the affective states of a person can be highly relevant for numerous
  disciplines, including adaptive user interfaces, entertainment, ergonomics, medicine
  and therapy. In many situations, the affective state of a user is not easily observable
  from outside by audio or video, but may be identified by a brain-computer interface
  (BCI). Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a brain imaging modality
  gaining rising attention in the BCI community. However, fNIRS emotion recognition
  studies have only analyzed stimulus-locked effects. For realistic human-machine
  interaction scenarios, the point of time of an emotion-triggering event and the
  time span of an affective state are unknown. In this paper, we investigate a BCI
  that monitors the affective states of the user continuously over time (i.e. asynchronous
  BCI). In our study, fNRIS signals from eight subjects have been recorded at eight
  prefrontal locations in response to three different classes of affect induction
  by emotional audio-visual stimuli plus a neutral class. Our system evaluates short
  windows of 5 s length to continuously recognize affective states. We analyze hemodynamic
  responses, present a careful evaluation of binary classification tasks, compare
  time-domain and wavelet-based signal features, and investigate classification accuracies
  over time.
