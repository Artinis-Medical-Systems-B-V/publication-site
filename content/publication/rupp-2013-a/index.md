abstract: "This study aimed to investigate the effects of sustained hypoxic exposure\
  \ on cerebral and muscle oxygenation and cardiorespiratory function at rest. Eleven\
  \ healthy subjects inhaled a normobaric hypoxic (FiO2=0.12) or normoxic (FiO2=0.21)\
  \ gas mixture for 4 h at rest, on two separated blinded sessions. Arterial oxygen\
  \ saturation (SpO2), heart rate variability (HRV), end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2), and oxygenation\
  \ of quadriceps muscle, prefrontal and motor cortices assessed by near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy (NIRS) were measured continuously during each session. Acute mountain\
  \ sickness symptoms were evaluated at the end of each session. During a hypoxic\
  \ session, SpO2 reduction (\u223C13%) plateaued after 20 min, while deoxygenation\
  \ pattern took 30 to 40 min at the cerebral sites to plateau (+5.3\xB11.6\u2009\u2009\
  $\u03BC$Mol of deoxygenated-hemoglobin). Deoxygenation was more pronounced in the\
  \ cerebral cortex compared to the muscle (+2.1\xB12.3\u2009\u2009$\u03BC$Mol of\
  \ deoxygenated-hemoglobin), and NIRS-derived tissue perfusion index showed distinct\
  \ profiles between the muscle (hypoperfusion) and the brain (hyperperfusion) with\
  \ prolonged hypoxia. Changes in tissue oxygenation were not associated with cardiorespiratory\
  \ responses (e.g., HRV, EtCO2) and altitude sickness symptom appearance during hypoxic\
  \ sessions. These data demonstrate that sustained hypoxia elicits time delay in\
  \ changes between arterial and tissue (especially cerebral) oxygenation, as well\
  \ as a tissue-specific sensitivity."
