abstract: This work reports on preliminary results about on hand movement recognition
  with Near InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS) and surface ElectroMyoGraphy (sEMG). Either
  basing on physical contact (touchscreens, data-gloves, etc.), vision techniques
  (Microsoft Kinect, Sony PlayStation Move, etc.), or other modalities, hand movement
  recognition is a pervasive function in today environment and it is at the base of
  many gaming, social, and medical applications. Albeit, in recent years, the use
  of muscle information extracted by sEMG has spread out from the medical applications
  to contaminate the consumer world, this technique still falls short when dealing
  with movements of the hand. We tested NIRS as a technique to get another point of
  view on the muscle phenomena and proved that, within a specific movements selection,
  NIRS can be used to recognize movements and return information regarding muscles
  at different depths. Furthermore, we propose here three different multimodal movement
  recognition approaches and compare their performances.
