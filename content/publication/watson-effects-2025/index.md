abstract: Background Evidence from randomised controlled trials demonstrates the modulatory
  effects of polyphenol consumption on the vascular system including improvements
  to cortical blood flow (CBF), microvascular blood flow, and large artery plasticity.
  Polyphenol-rich blackcurrants have been shown to inhibit monoamine oxidase, modulate
  brainwave spectral activity and modulate peripheral blood flow. This study assessed
  whether blackcurrant consumption can modulate blood flow in the shallow pre-frontal
  cortex, as measured using near infrared spectroscopy, during rest and under cognitive
  demand.  Methods A randomised double blind, placebo-controlled balanced cross over
  design was used to assess the efficacy of a cold pressed blackcurrant juice drink
  (Blackadder cultivar, Neuroberry, Plant and Food Research Ltd.) standardised at
  500 mg of total polyphenols upon attention and working memory and prefrontal cortical
  haemodynamics at rest and during cognitive load in 20 healthy young adults aged
  18–35 years, following a 60-minute absorption period.  Results Consumption of the
  Blackadder juice extract resulted in significant acute modulations of pre-frontal
  cortex haemodynamics during resting absorption and cognitive task performance as
  indicated by a decrease in deoxygenated haemoglobin [F(1,19) = 5.70, p = 0.027]
  and an increase in left hemisphere oxygenated haemoglobin during task performance
  [F(1.88,33.83) = 7.70, p = 0.002]. No effects on cognition were observed in this
  sample of healthy young adults.  Conclusion Results from this trial outline the
  ability of a blackcurrant juice extract to increase cerebral blood flow during cognitive
  demand in healthy young adults. The effects of the juice extract in addition to
  other types of blackcurrant extracts upon acute and chronic brain function and blood
  flow deserve further investigation.
