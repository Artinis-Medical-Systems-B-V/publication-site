abstract: Personnel selection and agent readiness are critical priorities for defense
  organizations, particularly in ensuring staff are adequately prepared for high-stakes
  environments such as public safety and military operations. Readiness assessments
  evaluate cognitive abilities, mental resilience, physical fitness, decision-making
  skills, and the ability to manage stress and workload. Traditional methods rely
  on performance indices from psychometric tests and physical evaluations. However,
  research suggests that incorporating behavioral and neurophysiological data, like
  cerebral blood flow oxygenation, enhances predictive capabilities for agent readiness.
  Methods such as the Revised Multi-Attribute Task Battery (MATB-II) have been developed
  to assess human decision-making and complex problem-solving capabilities, which
  are skills often considered when assessing readiness. The SHAD (Sensing Humans for
  Augmented Debrief) system is a training-support interface developed for such a multimodal
  approach that integrates wearable technology with psychometric profiling. SHAD captures
  neurophysiological signals—such as heart rate variability, brain oxygenation, and
  respiratory data—alongside psychometric assessments to predict and evaluate agents’
  mental and physical states in real time. The experimental design used MATB-II as
  a task to induce stress and workload in 41 participants from two public safety organizations.
  A machine learning model enabled readiness predictions, offering insights for personnel
  selection, mission preparation, and adaptive training. The model was trained on
  both psychometric data and neurophysiological data collected during the MATB-II
  task. This solution could significantly enhance public safety and defense missions
  by optimizing agent performance.
