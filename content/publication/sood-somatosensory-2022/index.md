abstract: Background Over-activation of prefrontal cortex during walking has been
  reported in older adults versus young adults. Heighted activity in prefrontal cortex
  suggests a shift toward an executive control strategy to control walking. A potential
  contributing factor is degraded functioning of pattern-generating locomotor circuits
  in the central nervous system that are important to walking coordination. Somatosensory
  information is a crucial input to these circuits, so age-related impairment of somatosensation
  would be expected to compromise the neural control of walking. The present study
  tested the hypothesis that poorer somatosensation in the feet of older adults will
  be associated with greater recruitment of the prefrontal cortex during walking.
  This study also examines the extent to which somatosensory function and prefrontal
  activity are associated with performance on walking and balance assessments.  Methods
  Forty seven older adults (age 74.6 Â± 6.8 years; 32 female) participated in walking
  assessments (typical walking and obstacle negotiation) and Berg Balance Test. During
  walking, prefrontal activity was measured with functional near infrared spectroscopy
  (fNIRS). Participants also underwent somatosensory testing with Semmes-Weinstein
  monofilaments.  Results The primary findings is that worse somatosensory monofilament
  level was associated with greater prefrontal cortical activity during typical walking
  (r = 0.38, p = 0.008) and obstacle negotiation (r = 0.40, p = 0.006). For the obstacle
  negotiation task, greater prefrontal activity was associated with faster walking
  speed (p = 0.004). Poorer somatosensation was associated with slower typical walking
  speed (p = 0.07) and obstacles walking speed (p textless 0.001), as well as poorer
  balance scores (p = 0.03).
