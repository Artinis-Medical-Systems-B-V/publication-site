abstract: The purpose of this research is to introduce an approach to assist the diagnosis
  of Parkinson’s disease (PD) by classifying functional near-infrared spectroscopy
  (fNIRS) studies as PD positive or negative. fNIRS is a non-invasive optical signal
  modality that conveys the brain’s hemodynamic response, specifically changes in
  blood oxygenation in the cerebral cortex; and its potential as a tool to assist
  PD detection deserves to be explored since it is non-invasive and cost-effective
  as opposed to other neuroimaging modalities. Besides the integration of fNIRS and
  machine learning, a contribution of this work is that various approaches were implemented
  and tested to find the implementation that achieves the highest performance. All
  the implementations used a logistic regression model for classification. A set of
  792 temporal and spectral features were extracted from each participant’s fNIRS
  study. In the two best performing implementations, an ensemble of feature-ranking
  techniques was used to select a reduced feature subset, which was subsequently reduced
  with a genetic algorithm. Achieving optimal detection performance, our approach
  reached 100 % accuracy, precision, and recall, with an F1 score and area under the
  curve (AUC) of 1, using 14 features. This significantly advances PD diagnosis, highlighting
  the potential of integrating fNIRS and machine learning for non-invasive PD detection.
