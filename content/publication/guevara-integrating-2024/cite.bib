 abstract = {The purpose of this research is to introduce an approach to assist the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) by classifying functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) studies as PD positive or negative. fNIRS is a non-invasive optical signal modality that conveys the brain’s hemodynamic response, specifically changes in blood oxygenation in the cerebral cortex; and its potential as a tool to assist PD detection deserves to be explored since it is non-invasive and cost-effective as opposed to other neuroimaging modalities. Besides the integration of fNIRS and machine learning, a contribution of this work is that various approaches were implemented and tested to find the implementation that achieves the highest performance. All the implementations used a logistic regression model for classification. A set of 792 temporal and spectral features were extracted from each participant’s fNIRS study. In the two best performing implementations, an ensemble of feature-ranking techniques was used to select a reduced feature subset, which was subsequently reduced with a genetic algorithm. Achieving optimal detection performance, our approach reached 100 % accuracy, precision, and recall, with an F1 score and area under the curve (AUC) of 1, using 14 features. This significantly advances PD diagnosis, highlighting the potential of integrating fNIRS and machine learning for non-invasive PD detection.},
