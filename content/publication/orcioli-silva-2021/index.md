abstract: "Background Dopaminergic medication improves gait in people with Parkinson\
  \ disease (PD). However, it remains unclear if dopaminergic medication modulates\
  \ cortical activity while walking.ObjectiveWe investigated the effects of dopaminergic\
  \ medication on cortical activity during unobstructed walking and obstacle avoidance\
  \ in people with PD.MethodsA total of 23 individuals with PD, in both off (PDOFF)\
  \ and on (PDON) medication states, and 30 healthy older adults (control group [CG])\
  \ performed unobstructed walking and obstacle avoidance conditions. Cortical activity\
  \ was acquired through a combined functional near-infrared spectroscopy electroencephalography\
  \ (EEG) system, along with gait parameters, through an electronic carpet. Prefrontal\
  \ cortex (PFC) oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) and EEG absolute power from FCz, Cz,\
  \ and CPz channels were calculated.ResultsHbO2 concentration reduced for people\
  \ with PDOFF during obstacle avoidance compared with unobstructed walking. In contrast,\
  \ both people with PDON and the CG had increased HbO2 concentration when avoiding\
  \ obstacles compared with unobstructed walking. Dopaminergic medication increased\
  \ step length, step velocity, and $\u03B2$ and $\u03B3$ power in the CPz channel,\
  \ regardless of walking condition. Moreover, dopaminergic-related changes (ie, on-off)\
  \ in FCz/CPz $\u03B3$ power were associated with dopaminergic-related changes in\
  \ step length for both walking conditions.ConclusionsPD compromises the activation\
  \ of the PFC during obstacle avoidance, and dopaminergic medication facilitates\
  \ its recruitment. In addition, PD medication increases sensorimotor integration\
  \ during walking by increasing posterior parietal cortex (CPz) activity. Increased\
  \ $\u03B3$ power in the CPz and FCz channels is correlated with step length improvements\
  \ achieved with dopaminergic medication during unobstructed walking and obstacle\
  \ avoidance in PD."
