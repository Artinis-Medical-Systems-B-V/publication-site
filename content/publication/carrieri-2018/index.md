abstract: 'The Key Search Task (KST) is a neuropsychological test that requires strategies
  for searching a lost key in an imaginary field. This request may involve different
  cognitive processes as mental imagery and navigation planning. This study was aimed
  at investigating, by a twenty-channel functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
  system, the hemodynamic response (i.e., oxygenated-hemoglobin (O 2 Hb) and deoxygenated-hemoglobin
  (HHb) changes) of the prefrontal cortex in navigation planning. A right ventrolateral
  prefrontal cortex (rVLPFC) activation during the KST was hypothesized. Thirty-eight
  volunteers performed the KST and a Control Task (CT), the latter requiring the volunteers
  to mark the X letter. An activation (i.e., increase/decrease in O 2 Hb/HHb) of:
  1) rVLPFC during the KST execution, and 2) bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
  (DLPFC) during the CT execution was found. The present study provides a contribution
  in localizing the rVLPFC as the critically active region, within the frontal lobes,
  that was found maximally activated during mental navigation in the mind''s eye of
  healthy participants while performing the KST. Considering the contribution of rVLPFC
  in spatial navigation, its activation suggests that the KST could be adopted in
  the clinical routine for investigating navigation planning. Compared to other neuroimaging
  techniques, fNIRS (with its relatively low physical constraints) contributes to
  better clarifying the role of rVLPFC in some aspects of human navigation. Therefore,
  the combined use of the fNIRS and the KST could be considered as an innovative and
  valid tool to evaluate fundamental functions for everyday life, such as spatial
  navigation planning.'
