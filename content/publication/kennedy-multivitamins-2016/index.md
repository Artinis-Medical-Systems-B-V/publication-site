abstract: 'Background: The brain is by far the most metabolically active organ in
  the body, with overall energy expenditure and local blood-supply closely related
  to neural activity. Both energy metabolism and cerebral vaso-dilation are dependent
  on adequate micronutrient status. This study investigated whether supplementation
  with ascending doses of multi-vitamin/minerals could modulate the metabolic and
  cerebral blood-flow consequences of performing cognitive tasks that varied in difficulty.
  Methods: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-groups study
  97 healthy females (25-49 y), who were not selected on the basis of any nutritional
  parameters, received either placebo or one of two doses of multivitamins/minerals.
  Cerebral blood-flow (CBF) parameters in the frontal cortex, and total energy expenditure
  (TotalEnergy), carbohydrate and fat oxidation (CarbOxi/FatOxi), were measured during
  5 tasks of graded cognitive difficulty and a control task (5 min per task) using
  Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and Indirect calorimetry of exhaled pulmonary
  gas (ICa) respectively. Assessments took place 60 min after the first dose and following
  eight weeks supplementation. Results: During task performance supplementation with
  the first dose of micronutrients led to a dose-dependent increase in TotalEnergy
  and FatOxi throughout the post-dose assessment period following the higher dose,
  and increases in the total concentration of haemoglobin, a proxy measure for CBF,
  during task performance following the lower dose of vitamins/minerals (also containing
  coenzyme-Q10). Chronic supplementation over 8 weeks led to a dose-dependent increase
  in TotalEnergy during the task period. There were no interpretable effects on mood
  or cognitive performance. Conclusions: These results show that acute supplementation
  with micronutrients in healthy adults can modulate metabolic parameters and cerebral
  blood flow during cognitive task performance, and that the metabolic consequences
  are sustained during chronic supplementation. These findings suggest that both brain
  function and metabolism are amenable to micronutrient supplementation, even in adults
  who are assumed to have nutritional status typical of the population. Trial registration:
