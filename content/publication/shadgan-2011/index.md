abstract: "This study investigated the pattern of changes in muscle oxygenation, deoxygenation\
  \ and blood volume in the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) in comparison with the parasternal\
  \ (PS) and intercostal (IC) muscles during a bout of incremental inspiratory threshold\
  \ loading (ITL) in healthy subjects using near-infrared spectroscopy. During progressive\
  \ loading, the PS and IC showed a significant increase in oxygenated hemoglobin\
  \ (5.9\xB12.3 and 6.8\xB12.4$\u03BC$M, P<0.05) and the SCM showed an increase in\
  \ deoxygenated hemoglobin (17.3\xB13.8$\u03BC$M, P<0.05). Total hemoglobin also\
  \ steadily increased in the SCM whereas it decreased in the quiescent vastus lateralis\
  \ muscle (20.7\xB16.1$\u03BC$M vs. -6.6\xB12.4$\u03BC$M, P<0.05), which was used\
  \ as the control muscle during the ITL. Our data suggests that the SCM is recruited\
  \ progressively during progressive ITL and is accompanied by an increased blood\
  \ volume and maintenance of O 2Hb. Blood redistribution away from the nonactive\
  \ limb muscles during the ITL may provide one source of maintaining inspiratory\
  \ muscle blood volume and oxygenation during high respiratory motor output. \xA9\
