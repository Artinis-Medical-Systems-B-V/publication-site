abstract: Prolonged uninterrupted sitting of textgreater3-hours has been shown to
  acutely cause central and peripheral cardiovascular dysfunction. However, individuals
  rarely sit uninterrupted for textgreater2-hours, and the cardiovascular response
  to this time is currently unknown. In addition, whilst increased cardiorespiratory
  fitness (CRF) and habitual physical activity (HPA) are independently associated
  with improvements in central and peripheral cardiovascular function, it remains
  unclear whether they influence the response to uninterrupted sitting. This study
  sought to 1) determine whether 2-hours of uninterrupted sitting acutely impairs
  carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV), femoral ankle PWV (faPWV), and central
  and peripheral blood pressure, and (2) to investigate the associations between CRF
  and HPA versus PWV changes during uninterrupted sitting. Following 2-hours of uninterrupted
  sitting, faPWV significantly increased (mean difference [MD] = 0.26 mÂ·s-1, standard
  error [SE] = 0.10, p = 0.013) as did diastolic blood pressure (MD = 2.83 mmHg, SE
  = 1.08, p = 0.014), however cfPWV did not significantly change. Whilst our study
  shows 2-hours uninterrupted sitting significantly impairs faPWV, neither CRF ( r
  = 0.105, p = 0.595) nor HPA ( r = -0.228, p = 0.253) were associated with the increases.
