abstract: "Purpose: We investigated the cardiovascular individual response to 6 weeks\
  \ (3\xD7/week) of work-matched within the severe-intensity domain (high-intensity\
  \ interval training, HIIT) or moderate-intensity domain (moderate-intensity continuous\
  \ training, MICT). In addition, we analyzed the cardiovascular factors at baseline\
  \ underlying the response variability. Methods: 42 healthy sedentary participants\
  \ were randomly assigned to HIIT or MICT. We applied the region of practical equivalence-method\
  \ for identifying the levels of responders to the maximal oxygen uptake (V\u0307\
  O2max) response. For investigating the influence of cardiovascular markers, we trained\
  \ a Bayesian machine learning model on cardiovascular markers. Results: Despite\
  \ that HIIT and MICT induced significant increases in V\u0307O2max, HIIT had greater\
  \ improvements than MICT (p < 0.001). Greater variability was observed in MICT,\
  \ with approximately 50% classified as \u201Cnon-responder\u201D and \u201Cundecided\u201D\
  . 20 \u201Cresponders\u201D, one \u201Cundecided\u201D and no \u201Cnon-responders\u201D\
  \ were observed in HIIT. The variability in the \u2206V\u0307O2max was associated\
  \ with initial cardiorespiratory fitness, arterial stiffness, and left-ventricular\
  \ (LV) mass and LV end-diastolic diameter in HIIT; whereas, microvascular responsiveness\
  \ and right-ventricular (RV) excursion velocity showed a significant association\
  \ in MICT. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the critical influence of exercise-intensity\
  \ domains and biological variability on the individual V\u0307O2max response. The\
  \ incidence of \u201Cnon-responders\u201D in MICT was one third of the group; whereas,\
  \ no \u201Cnon-responders\u201D were observed in HIIT. The incidence of \u201Cresponders\u201D\
  \ was 11 out of 21 participants in MICT, and 20 out of 21 participants in HIIT.\
  \ The response in HIIT showed associations with baseline fitness, arterial stiffness,\
  \ and LV-morphology; whereas, it was associated with RV systolic function in MICT."
