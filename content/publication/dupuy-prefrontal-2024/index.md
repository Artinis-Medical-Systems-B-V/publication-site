abstract: 'Recent research suggests that museum visits can benefit psychological well-being
  by reducing symptoms of stress and anxiety. However, these reported relaxing effects
  remain inconsistent between studies. Shedding light on the underlying cerebral mechanisms
  of museum visits might support a better understanding of how it affects psychological
  well-being. This study aimed to investigate the prefrontal engagement evoked by
  artwork analysis during a museum visit and to determine if these prefrontal substrates
  are associated with the museum’s effect on psychological well-being in older adults.
  Nineteen adults aged between 65 and 79, toured a Baroque-style exhibit at the Montreal
  Museum of Fine Arts for approximately 20 minutes while equipped with a near-infrared
  spectroscopy system measuring the prefrontal cortex’s hemodynamic activity. For
  each painting, participants received the instruction to either (1): analyze the
  painting and produce a personal interpretation of its signification (analytic condition)
  or (2) visualize the painting without any specific thoughts (visualization condition).
  Questionnaires measuring stress, anxiety, and well-being were administered before
  and after the visit. Sixteen older women (71.5 ± 4 years) were included in the analyses.
  Results showed that, at the group level, the analytic condition was associated with
  an increased activation pattern in the left ventrolateral prefrontal region, typically
  related to attentional processes (not observed in the visualization condition).
  The activation associated with the analytic condition predicted pre-/post-visit
  reductions in self-reported anxiety and stress in the sample of older women. These
  observations suggest that the level of engagement of attentional processes during
  artwork analysis may play a major role in the effect of a museum’s visit on self-reported
  symptoms of anxiety.'
