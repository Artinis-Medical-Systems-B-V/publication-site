abstract: 'Introduction: Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) is one of the most
  prevalent pediatric chronic conditions. Without proper intervention, significant
  delays in motor skill performance and learning may persist until adulthood. Moderate-to-vigorous
  physical exercise has been proven to improve motor learning (adaptation and consolidation)
  in children with or without disorders. However, the effect of a short bout of physical
  exercise on motor adaptation and consolidation in children with DCD has not been
  examined. Furthermore, the role of perceptual-motor integration and attention as
  mediators of learning has not been examined via neuroimaging in this population.
  Objectives: Therefore, the primary aims of this project will be to compare children
  with and without DCD to (a) examine the effect of acute exercise on motor learning
  (adaptation and consolidation) while performing a rotational visuo-motor adaptation
  task (rVMA), and (b) explore cortical activation in the dorsolateral- and ventrolateral-prefrontal
  cortex areas while learning the rVMA task under rest or post-exercise conditions.
  Methods: One hundred twenty children will be recruited (60 DCD, 60 controls) and
  within-cohort randomly assigned to either exercise (13-minute shuttle run task)
  or rest prior to performing the rVMA task. Adaptation and consolidation will be
  evaluated via two error variables and three retention tests (1h, 24h and 7 days
  post adaptation). Cortical activation will be registered via functional near-infrared
  spectroscopy (fNIRS) during the baseline, adaptation, and consolidation. Discussion:
  We expect to find exercise benefits on motor learning and attention so that children
  with DCD profiles will be closer to those of children with typical development.
  The results of this project will provide further evidence to: (a) better characterize
  children with DCD for the design of educational materials, and (b) establish acute
  exercise as a potential intervention to improve motor learning and attention.'
