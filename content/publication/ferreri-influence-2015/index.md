abstract: Music can be thought of as a complex stimulus able to enrich the encoding
  of an event thus boosting its subsequent retrieval. However, several findings suggest
  that music can also interfere with memory performance. A better understanding of
  the behavioral and neural processes involved can substantially improve knowledge
  and shed new light on the most efficient music-based interventions. Based on fNIRS
  studies on music, episodic encoding, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC),
  this work aims to extend previous findings by monitoring the entire lateral PFC
  during both encoding and retrieval of verbal material. Nineteen participants were
  asked to encode lists of words presented with either background music or silence
  and subsequently tested during a free recall task. Meanwhile, their PFC was monitored
  using a 48-channel fNIRS system. Behavioral results showed greater chunking of words
  under the music condition, suggesting the employment of associative strategies for
  items encoded with music. fNIRS results showed that music provided a less demanding
  way of modulating both episodic encoding and retrieval, with a general prefrontal
  decreased activity under the music versus silence condition. This suggests that
  music-related memory processes rely on specific neural mechanisms and that music
  can positively influence both episodic encoding and retrieval of verbal information.
