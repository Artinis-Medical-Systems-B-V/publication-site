abstract: "It is uncommon for cardio-respiratory fitness and skeletal muscle metabolic\
  \ function to be assessed independently within an exercise test. Exercise capacity\
  \ may require adaptation of one or other of these systems to a greater or lesser\
  \ extent and the presence of disease may affect them to different extents. The physiological\
  \ mechanisms underpinning the decline in exercise tolerance with age/disease and\
  \ the benefits of exercise-training as a preventative therapy for some diseases\
  \ are not fully understood.In this thesis functional capacity was assessed in terms\
  \ of oxidative capacity. Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) measures microvascular\
  \ changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin and can be used to estimate\
  \ oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle when combined with arterial occlusions.\
  \ Oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle was determined as part of 3 studies; (1)\
  \ in a group of older adults (>65 years old) with or without type 2 diabetes (T2D),\
  \ (2) in a tri-ethnic group of older adults from the same cohort with the objective\
  \ of determining ethnic difference in oxidative capacity independently of T2D and\
  \ (3) in a group of young adults before and after a period of endurance training\
  \ in preparation for their first marathon.NIRS measurements of muscle oxidative\
  \ capacity revealed poorer function in older adults with diabetes (57.5\xB16.8 versus\
  \ 38.7\xB12.6 s, p=0.02) and poorer oxidative capacity in South Asian older adults\
  \ independently of T2D (difference (95%CI): 10.1 (2.3, 17.9) s, p=0.011). In young\
  \ healthy men and women, skeletal muscle oxygen consumption post-exercise increased\
  \ with endurance training (p < 0.01) despite no improvement in cardio-pulmonary\
  \ peakV\u0307O2 (p=0.81). Faster marathon completion time correlated with cardio-pulmonary\
  \ peakV\u0307O2 (rpartial=-0.55, p < 0.01) but not oxidative capacity.Skeletal muscle\
  \ oxidative capacity can be measured in old and young adults using NIRS combined\
  \ with arterial occlusion performed immediately following exercise testing. People\
  \ with T2D have poorer oxidative capacity compared to people without and South Asians\
  \ have poorer oxidative capacity compared to Europeans which African Caribbean's\
  \ and Europeans had similar skeletal muscle oxidative capacity. Skeletal muscle\
  \ metabolic adaptions occur following 6 months of endurance training. Although the\
  \ cardio-pulmonary system is limiting for running performance, skeletal muscle changes\
  \ can be detected despite no significant improvement in cardio-pulmonary function."
