abstract: "\xA9 2019 SPIE Background: Overactivity of the bladder (OAB) affects 20%\
  \ of people globally, causing urgency to void and incontinence of urine (UI)). OAB\
  \ has a multi-factorial causation. Problematically current tests are invasive and\
  \ provide limited information. Recent advances in NIRS technology now offer non-invasive\
  \ evaluation of brain neuroexcitation and bladder hemodynamics/oxygenation related\
  \ to micturition. We tested the hypothesis that brain and bladder parameters can\
  \ be monitored simultaneously with patient-controlled quantification of bladder\
  \ sensation, and that brain-mediated control impacts UI in OAB. Methods: A symptomatic\
  \ patient (OAB) and asymptomatic control were monitored during spontaneous bladder\
  \ filling to capacity with fNIRS of the anterior cortex and continuous wave NIRS\
  \ of the bladder while using a validated patient-controlled sensory meter. Changes\
  \ in oxygenated, de-oxygenated and total hemoglobin in brain and bladder were recorded,\
  \ and sensory events (bladder fullness/urgency to void) documented. Results: In\
  \ the asymptomatic control fNIRS-derived neuroexcitation was evident when the bladder\
  \ filled to capacity, increased at decision to void, was most intense during voiding,\
  \ and waned thereafter. The OAB subject showed progressive increase in neuroexcitation\
  \ from documenting a desire to void, to recording sensing urgency (imminent UI).\
  \ At this point a distractor stimulus occurred (unexpected phone call), the sensation\
  \ of urgency waned and an abrupt decrease in cortical oxyhemoglobin concentration\
  \ was evident. Conclusion: Simultaneous brain fNIRS, bladder NIRS and sensation\
  \ quantification is feasible and adds to OAB evaluation. fNIRS-derived neuroexcitation\
  \ occurs in association with sensed voiding events. The attenuation of urgency/UI\
  \ by a distractor stimulus implies brain-mediated mechanisms are integral to OAB."
