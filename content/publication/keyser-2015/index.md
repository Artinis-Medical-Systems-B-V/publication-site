abstract: "PURPOSE:: To characterize the cardiorespiratory response to exercise before\
  \ and after aerobic exercise training in patients with interstitial lung disease.\
  \ METHODS:: We performed a clinical study, examining 13 patients (New York Heart\
  \ Association/World Health Organization Functional class II or III) before and after\
  \ 10 weeks of supervised treadmill exercise walking, at 70% to 80% of heart rate\
  \ reserve, 30 to 45 minutes per session, 3 times a week. Outcome variables included\
  \ measures of cardiorespiratory function during a treadmill cardiopulmonary exercise\
  \ test, with additional near infrared spectroscopy measurements of peripheral oxygen\
  \ extraction and bioimpedance cardiography measurements of cardiac output. Six-minute\
  \ walk test distance was also measured. RESULTS:: All subjects participated in at\
  \ least 24 of their 30 scheduled exercise sessions with no significant adverse events.\
  \ After training, the mean 6-minute walk test distance increased by 52 \xB1 48 m\
  \ (P = .001), peak treadmill cardiopulmonary exercise test time increased by 163\
  \ \xB1 130 s (P = .001), and time to achieve gas exchange threshold increased by\
  \ 145 \xB1 37 s (P < .001). Despite a negligible increase in peak (Equation is included\
  \ in full-text article.)o2 with no changes to cardiac output, the overall work rate/(Equation\
  \ is included in full-text article.)o2 relationship was enhanced after training.\
  \ Muscle O2 extraction increased by 16% (P = .049) after training. CONCLUSIONS::\
  \ Clinically significant improvements in cardiorespiratory function were observed\
  \ after aerobic exercise training in this group of subjects with interstitial lung\
  \ disease. These improvements appear to have been mediated by increases in the peripheral\
  \ extraction of O2 rather than changes in O2 delivery."
