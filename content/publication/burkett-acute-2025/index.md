abstract: Introduction  Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a noninvasive
  technique for measuring cortical brain neuroexcitation.  Objective  The objective
  of this study was to determine if fNIRS could detect differences in prefrontal cortex
  (PFC) neuroexcitation due to acute ON/OFF changes in sacral neuromodulation (SNM)
  during natural bladder filling.  Study Design  Female participants who had an SNM
  device implanted for ≥6 months underwent a 2-fill natural hydration protocol in
  this cross-sectional study. Continuous oxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb) concentration
  was recorded using an fNIRS headcap as a measure of neuroexcitation. Sacral neuromodulation
  devices were acutely changed from ON to OFF and OFF to ON in 3-minute cycles. One-minute
  segments of fNIRS signals before and after acute modulation were selected and linear
  fitting was used to output slope. Two-minute control periods at a similar level
  of bladder sensation were used for comparison.  Results  Twelve women completed
  the study and median time from SNM implant was 13 (6, 42) months. In the left and
  middle PFC regions, there was a significant alteration of fNIRS slope (∆O2Hb/time)
  from baseline to postactivation (OFF to ON) compared to control periods. The first
  deactivation (ON to OFF) showed continuation of the prior fNIRS slope. The control
  segments showed stability of averaged O2Hb signals regardless of sensation in all
  brain regions.  Conclusions  This study indicates that fNIRS may be a useful tool
  to assess acute changes in neuroexcitation of the PFC in response to SNM device
  activation in female patients with overactive bladder. The results suggest that
  SNM may acutely affect the PFC during bladder filling.
