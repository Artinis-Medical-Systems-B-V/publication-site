abstract: 'Background: Occupational workload can contribute to significant health
  problems such as chronic stress, fatigue and burnout. To investigate the underlying
  mechanisms, it is necessary to monitor brain activity in real work environments.
  Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a portable, non-invasive neuroimaging
  method that captures neural correlates of occupational workload under natural conditions.
  However, despite its increasing application, a comprehensive overview of fNIRS-based
  research in this field is lacking. Therefore, this systematic review examines how
  fNIRS can be utilized to investigate occupational workload.  Methods: Following
  PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we conducted our systematic review by searching Web of Science,
  PubMed, and Scopus between November 15, 2023 and March 20, 2025. We included all
  studies published in English or German at any date, as long as they examined healthy
  adult professionals performing occupational tasks with functional near-infrared
  spectroscopy (fNIRS). Extracted data included study characteristics, workload details,
  signal processing methods, main fNIRS findings, and study quality, assessed using
  the JBI Critical Appraisal Tool.  Results: We included 41 studies. Of these, 23
  reported a significant increase in oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) concentration and
  functional connectivity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) under higher occupational
  workload conditions. Only five studies examined typical office tasks. Nine studies
  analyzed differences in cortical activation between experts and novices, with experts
  showing increased HbO concentration in the PFC than novices. Regarding methodology,
  26 studies used standardized optode placements, while only 17 applied systemic and
  extracerebral artifact correction. Small sample sizes and the absence of randomized
  controlled trials limited the reliability and reproducibility of the findings.  Conclusion:
  Functional near-infrared spectroscopy effectively detects neural correlates of occupational
  workload and provides objective insights into cognitive demands in real-world work
  settings. Standardizing optode placement, harmonizing signal-processing methods,
  and increasing sample sizes would enhance the validity and comparability of future
  research. Expanding investigations to typical office environments is also crucial
  for understanding daily workload and for developing interventions that promote employee
  well-being and productivity. Overall, fNIRS represents a promising tool for establishing
  evidence-based workplace health promotion strategies across diverse occupational
  settings.'
