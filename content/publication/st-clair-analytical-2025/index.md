abstract: Abstract Much of a child’s early learning takes place during social interactions
  with others. Neural synchrony, the temporal alignment of individuals’ functional
  brain activity, is a neural mechanism that may support successful interaction, but
  its biological origins and sensitivity to environmental factors remain unknown.
  This study measures neural coherence between 4- to 6-year-old children and their
  mothers using wearable functional near-infrared spectroscopy (“fNIRS”) in a collaborative
  problem-solving hyperscanning paradigm. Best practices in fNIRS data processing
  are incorporated to optimise coherence quantification and extricate environmental-
  and task-related effects. Results suggest physiological noise in the extracerebral
  layer artificially inflated coherence strength in both oxygenated (“HbO2”) and deoxygenated
  (“HbR”) haemoglobin. Coherence remained stronger during collaborative than during
  individual problem solving in both chromophores after physiological noise reduction.
  Phase-scrambled pseudodyad analyses supported the interpretation that coherence
  during collaboration relates to temporal dynamics of interaction rather than to
  task- or environmental-related components. Strength of HbO2 coherence was positively
  related to collaborative task performance and negatively related to background maternal
  stress. HbR coherence was also related to task performance and maternal stress but
  the direction of results were mixed. Overall, this study provides new insight into
  the nature of neural coherence between 4- to 6-year-old children and their mothers
  during collaborative play.
