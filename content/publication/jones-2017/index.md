abstract: "Background: Hypertension has adverse effects on microvascular function\
  \ but there are limited methods that permit non-invasive assessment of the microcirculation\
  \ in man in vivo. We used Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) to assess microvascular\
  \ reactive hyperaemia in skeletal muscle following a short period of ischemia. We\
  \ tested if differences between normotensive and hypertensive individuals could\
  \ be detected. Methods: Older adults enrolled in a population-based cohort study\
  \ underwent measurements of oxy-Hb changes during a 30-second arterial occlusion\
  \ and hyperaemic response using NIRS (Portamon, Artinis). Time-to-peak hyperaemic\
  \ response was calculated. Hypertension diagnosis was determined by questionnaire\
  \ and clinic blood pressure (BP) (diastolic BP > 90 mmHg or systolic BP > 140 mmHg).\
  \ Diabetes diagnosis and information about medication were determined by questionnaire.\
  \ Data are mean (SD) or adjusted mean\xB1SEM. Multivariable linear regression was\
  \ used. Associations with hypertension were adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity\
  \ and presence of diabetes. Results: 129 participants (99 = male, 72(6) years old,\
  \ 74(57%) hypertensive participated). Time-to-peak hyperaemic response was significantly\
  \ longer in hypertensive than normotensive participants after adjustment for age\
  \ and gender (12.5\xB10.49 versus 10.5\xB10.57seconds, p = 0.06). This association\
  \ persisted after adjustment for ethnicity and the presence of diabetes (12.6\xB1\
  0.50 versus 10.5\xB10.57, p = 0.03). Conclusion: Hypertension is associated with\
  \ impairment of post-ischemic reactive hyperaemia in skeletal muscle microvasculature.\
  \ Differences between hypertensive and normotensive older adults can be detected\
  \ non-invasively using NIRS."
