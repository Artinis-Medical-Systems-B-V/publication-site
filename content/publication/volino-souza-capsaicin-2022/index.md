abstract: Purpose Capsaicin (CAP) has been demonstrated to activate the transient
  receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1), which can regulate
  nitric oxide production and, consequently, affect oxygen delivery to the muscles.
  In addition, TRPV1 activation can lead to calcium release from the sarcoplasmic
  reticulum, which is crucial for optimal force development. Therefore, this study
  aimed to evaluate the effect of a single dose of capsaicin on leg extension exercise
  performance and skeletal muscle oxygenation (SmO2) during exercise and exercise
  recovery in physically active individuals.  Methods In a randomized, double-blind,
  crossover study, eight males ingested 12 mg of CAP or maltodextrin as a placebo
  (PLA). Forty-five minutes after supplementation, the participants performed three
  sets of leg extension exercises at 70% of 1 repetition maximum, and the number of
  repetitions was evaluated. During exercise and exercise recovery, SmO2 parameters
  were recorded. Plasma lactate was analyzed before supplementation, immediately,
  and 10 min after exercise.  Results There were no changes in SmO2 parameters (p textgreater 0.05)
  and the number of repetitions (p textgreater 0.05) throughout the three sets of
  leg extensions. Additionally, a medium (d = 0.67), large (d = 0.83) and small (d = 0.31)
  effect size was observed in resaturation rate during set 1, set 2, and set 3 recovery.
  Plasma lactate increased significantly (p textless 0.05) immediately after exercise
  in both CAP and PLA groups without significant changes between the groups (p textgreater 0.05).  Conclusion
  A single dose of capsaicin did not change SmO2 parameters and muscular performance
  during resistance exercise in physically active individuals.
