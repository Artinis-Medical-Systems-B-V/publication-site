 abstract = {To determine muscle oxygenation with continuous blood flow restriction (BFR) training in high load (HL), 80% one-repetition maximum (1RM) and low load (LL), 30% 1RM squat exercises. In week-2 of a 4-week resistance training programme as part of their 3-set training routine, two groups of athletes (n = 4 each), one performing HL training with low cuff pressure (20% arterial occlusion pressure (AOP)), the other LL training with high cuff pressure (60% AOP) had muscle oxygenation assessed with near-infrared spectrophotometry (NIRS), arterial oxygen saturation (SPO2), heart rate (HR), barbell velocity and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) during barbell back squats (BBS). Changes in the vastus lateralis oximetry were compared to pre- and post-training squat (1RM). Across athletes, there were significant associations between two pre-set-3 exercise variables and post-training 1RM, Tissue Saturation Index (TSI) (R2 = 0.92, p \textless 0.0002) and HHb concentration (R2 = 0.79, p \textless 0.003). Generalised regression models indicated that TSI % and HHb concentrations before and after set 3 timepoints were significant predictors of post-training 1RM in the LL group (R2 = 0.99, BIC = −24.9). Well-tolerated continuous LL-BFR training provided greater increases in strength than HL-BFR in athletes.},
