abstract: To determine muscle oxygenation with continuous blood flow restriction (BFR)
  training in high load (HL), 80% one-repetition maximum (1RM) and low load (LL),
  30% 1RM squat exercises. In week-2 of a 4-week resistance training programme as
  part of their 3-set training routine, two groups of athletes (n = 4 each), one performing
  HL training with low cuff pressure (20% arterial occlusion pressure (AOP)), the
  other LL training with high cuff pressure (60% AOP) had muscle oxygenation assessed
  with near-infrared spectrophotometry (NIRS), arterial oxygen saturation (SPO2),
  heart rate (HR), barbell velocity and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) during
  barbell back squats (BBS). Changes in the vastus lateralis oximetry were compared
  to pre- and post-training squat (1RM). Across athletes, there were significant associations
  between two pre-set-3 exercise variables and post-training 1RM, Tissue Saturation
  Index (TSI) (R2 = 0.92, p textless 0.0002) and HHb concentration (R2 = 0.79, p textless 0.003).
  Generalised regression models indicated that TSI % and HHb concentrations before
  and after set 3 timepoints were significant predictors of post-training 1RM in the
  LL group (R2 = 0.99, BIC = −24.9). Well-tolerated continuous LL-BFR training provided
  greater increases in strength than HL-BFR in athletes.
