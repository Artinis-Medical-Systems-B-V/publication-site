abstract: "Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the acute vascular\
  \ and oxygenation responses to repeated sprint exercise during arm cycling with\
  \ either blood flow restriction (BFR) or systemic hypoxia alone or in combination.\
  \ Design: The study design was a single-blinded repeated-measures assessment of\
  \ four conditions with two levels of normobaric hypoxia (400 m and 3800 m) and two\
  \ levels of BFR (0% and 45% of total occlusion). Methods: Sixteen active participants\
  \ (eleven men and five women; mean \xB1 SD; 26.4 \xB1 4.0 years old; 73.8 \xB1 9.8\
  \ kg; 1.79 \xB1 0.07 m) completed 5 sessions (1 familiarization, 4 conditions).\
  \ During each test visit, participants performed a repeated sprint arm cycling test\
  \ to exhaustion (10 s maximal sprints with 20 s recovery until exhaustion) to measure\
  \ power output, metabolic equivalents, blood flow, as well as oxygenation (near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy) of the biceps brachii muscle tissue. Results: Repeated sprint performance\
  \ was decreased with both BFR and systemic hypoxia conditions. Greater changes between\
  \ minimum-maximum of sprints in total hemoglobin concentration ($\u0394$[tHb]) were\
  \ demonstrated with BFR (400 m, 45% and 3800 m, 45%) than without (400 m, 0% and\
  \ 3800 m, 0%) (p < 0.001 for both). Additionally, delta tissue saturation index\
  \ ($\u0394$TSI) decreased more with both BFR conditions than without (p < 0.001\
  \ for both). The absolute maximum TSI was progressively reduced with both BFR and\
  \ systemic hypoxia (p < 0.001). Conclusions: By combining high-intensity, repeated\
  \ sprint exercise with BFR and/or systemic hypoxia, there is a robust stimulus detected\
  \ by increased changes in blood perfusion placed on specific vascular mechanisms,\
  \ which were more prominent in BFR conditions."
