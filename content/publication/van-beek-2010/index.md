abstract: "Cerebrovascular function and structure of the cortical cerebral microvessels\
  \ are profoundly altered in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The functional\
  \ hemodynamic consequences of such changes, however, remain essentially unknown.\
  \ Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) potentially affect brain perfusion through either\
  \ augmentation or inhibiti n of cerebral vasodilatation. This study investigated\
  \ the cerebrovascular regulation during postural changes in AD before and after\
  \ treatment with the ChEI galantamine. In 21 AD patients and 20 controls, blood\
  \ pressure (BP - Finapres), frontal cortical oxygenation (near-infrared-spectroscopy),\
  \ and cerebral blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (transcranial Doppler\
  \ ultrasonography) were measured following a hypotensive challenge induced by postural\
  \ change. In AD, measurements were repeated after 10 (SD 4) weeks of galantamine.\
  \ Baseline cerebrovascular resistance was higher in AD (AD 2.83 (0.87) mmHg/cm/s,\
  \ control 2.24 (1.3) mmHg/cm/s, p=0.010). 13 AD patients and 17 controls had a sufficiently\
  \ large postural drop in BP (> 10 mmHg). AD patients had a larger postural decline\
  \ in the frontal cortical concentration of total hemoglobin ($\u0394$ [tHb] AD=1.03\
  \ (0.70) $\u03BC$mol/l, control =0.30 (0.90) $\u03BC$mol/l, p=0.015). Moreover,\
  \ the reduction in oxygenated hemoglobin was 57% larger in AD (p=0.085). Unexpectedly,\
  \ the postural changes in BP were smaller in AD. Galantamine treatment affected\
  \ neither orthostatic BP nor the decrease in [tHb]. In conclusion, even for moderate\
  \ orthostatic hypotension during commonly occurring postural changes, cerebral cortical\
  \ tissue perfusion declined more in AD, suggesting increased ischemic vulnerability\
  \ of the brain. Galantamine neither improved nor impaired cerebrovascular regulation.\
