 abstract = {Background
Methods for modulating the cerebellum with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are well established, and preliminary data from our group and others has shown evidence of transient improvements in balance after cerebellar repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in progressive suprancuclear palsy (PSP). This study examines extensive posturography measures before and after 10 sessions of cerebellar rTMS and sham TMS in PSP.

Methods
Thirty subjects with PSP and postural instability will undergo cerebellar active and sham rTMS in a single-blind, crossover design with a randomized order of a 10-day intervention. Primary outcomes will be changes in sway area and medio-lateral range of sway with eyes open while standing on a stationary force-plate, and safety, tolerability, and blindedness. Secondary outcomes will include posturography and gait analysis with body-worn, triaxial inertial sensors, clinical balance scales and questionnaires, and a bedside test of vestibular function. Exploratory outcomes are changes in functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signal over the prefrontal, supplementary motor, and primary motor cortices while standing and walking, and speech samples for future analysis.

Discussion
The C-STIM crossover intervention study adds a longer duration of stimulation and extensive posturography measures to more finely measure the improvements in balance and exploratory functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) over the prefronal, supplementary motor, and primary motor cortices during balance assessments before and after 10 sessions of cerebellar rTMS and 10 sessions of sham cerebellar TMS. This project will improve our understanding of the importance of the cerebellum for control of postural stability in PSP.},
