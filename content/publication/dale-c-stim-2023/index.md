abstract: Background Methods for modulating the cerebellum with transcranial magnetic
  stimulation (TMS) are well established, and preliminary data from our group and
  others has shown evidence of transient improvements in balance after cerebellar
  repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in progressive suprancuclear
  palsy (PSP). This study examines extensive posturography measures before and after
  10 sessions of cerebellar rTMS and sham TMS in PSP.  Methods Thirty subjects with
  PSP and postural instability will undergo cerebellar active and sham rTMS in a single-blind,
  crossover design with a randomized order of a 10-day intervention. Primary outcomes
  will be changes in sway area and medio-lateral range of sway with eyes open while
  standing on a stationary force-plate, and safety, tolerability, and blindedness.
  Secondary outcomes will include posturography and gait analysis with body-worn,
  triaxial inertial sensors, clinical balance scales and questionnaires, and a bedside
  test of vestibular function. Exploratory outcomes are changes in functional near
  infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signal over the prefrontal, supplementary motor, and
  primary motor cortices while standing and walking, and speech samples for future
  analysis.  Discussion The C-STIM crossover intervention study adds a longer duration
  of stimulation and extensive posturography measures to more finely measure the improvements
  in balance and exploratory functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) over the
  prefronal, supplementary motor, and primary motor cortices during balance assessments
  before and after 10 sessions of cerebellar rTMS and 10 sessions of sham cerebellar
  TMS. This project will improve our understanding of the importance of the cerebellum
  for control of postural stability in PSP.
