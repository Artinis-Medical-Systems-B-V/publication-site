abstract: "Recently, real time imaging of the cortical control of gait became possible\
  \ with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). So far, little is known about\
  \ the activations of various cortical areas in more complex forms of gait, such\
  \ as precision stepping. From previous work on animals and humans one would expect\
  \ precision stepping to elicit extra activity in the sensorimotor cortices (S1/M1),\
  \ supplementary motor area (SMA), as well as in prefrontal cortices (PFC). In the\
  \ current study, hemodynamic changes in the PFC, SMA, M1, and S1 were measured with\
  \ fNIRS. In contrast to previous fNIRS gait studies, the technique was optimized\
  \ by the use of reference channels (to correct for superficial hemodynamic interference).\
  \ Eleven subjects randomly performed ten trials of treadmill walking at 3. km/h\
  \ (normal walking) and ten trials of 3. km/h treadmill walking on predefined spots\
  \ for the left and right foot presented on the treadmill (precision stepping). The\
  \ walking trials of approximately 35. seconds were alternated with rest periods\
  \ of 25-35. seconds consisting of quiet standing. The PFC revealed profound activation\
  \ just prior to the onset of both walking tasks. There was also extra activation\
  \ of the PFC during the first half of the task period for precision stepping. The\
  \ SMA showed mainly increased activation prior to the start of both tasks. In contrast,\
  \ the sensorimotor cortex did not show a change in activation during either task\
  \ as compared to a condition of standing. The SMA, M1, and S1 revealed no significant\
  \ differences between normal walking and precision stepping. It was concluded that\
  \ fNIRS is suited to record the planning and initiation of gait. The lack of M1/S1\
  \ activation during gait suggests that even in the current precision stepping task\
  \ the control of ongoing gait depended mostly on subcortical automatisms, while\
  \ motor cortex contributions did not differ between standing and walking. \xA9 2013\
