abstract: "Background: Obstacle negotiation is a daily activity that requires the\
  \ integration of sensorimotor and cognitive information. Recent studies provide\
  \ evidence for the important role of prefrontal cortex during obstacle negotiation.\
  \ We aimed to explore the effects of obstacle height and available response time\
  \ on prefrontal activation. Methods: Twenty healthy young adults (age: 30.1 \xB1\
  \ 1.0 years; 50% women) walked in an obstacle course while negotiating anticipated\
  \ and unanticipated obstacles at heights of 50 mm and 100 mm. Prefrontal activation\
  \ was measured using a functional near-infrared spectroscopy system. Kinect cameras\
  \ measured the obstacle negotiation strategy. Prefrontal activation was defined\
  \ based on mean level of HbO2 before, during and after obstacle negotiation and\
  \ the HbO2 slope from gait initiation and throughout the task. Changes between types\
  \ of obstacles were assessed using linear-mix models and partial correlation analyses\
  \ evaluated the relationship between prefrontal activation and the distance between\
  \ the feet as the subjects traversed the obstacles. Results: Different obstacle\
  \ heights showed similar changes in prefrontal activation measures (p > 0.210).\
  \ However, during unanticipated obstacles, the slope of the HbO2 response was steeper\
  \ (p = 0.048), as compared to anticipated obstacles. These changes in prefrontal\
  \ activation during negotiation of unanticipated obstacles were correlated with\
  \ greater distance of the leading foot after the obstacles (r = 0.831, p = 0.041).\
  \ Conclusions: These findings are the first to show that the pattern of prefrontal\
  \ activation depends on the nature of the obstacle. More specifically, during unanticipated\
  \ obstacles the recruitment of the prefrontal cortex is faster and greater than\
  \ during negotiating anticipated obstacles. These results provide evidence of the\
  \ important role of the prefrontal cortex and the ability of healthy young adults\
  \ to tailor the activation pattern to different types of obstacles."
