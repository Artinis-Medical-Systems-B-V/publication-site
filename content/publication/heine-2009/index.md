abstract: "We tested hypothesis that cerebral deoxygenation near maximal exercise\
  \ intensity is mediated by hyperventilation, via hypocapnia-induced reductions in\
  \ cerebral blood flow, by utilizing canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to determine\
  \ the relative influence of cardiopulmonary changes on cerebral oxygenation, as\
  \ assessed by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Twenty-three subjects performed\
  \ incremental exercise tests under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Changes in ventilation\
  \ (over(V, \u0307)E) were strongly correlated with end-tidal CO2 (PE TC O2) and\
  \ NIRS after the respiratory compensation point (RCP) (r2 > 0.97). However, in contrast\
  \ to our expectations, CBF velocity (CBFv) shared the least amount of variance with\
  \ NIRS measurements (r2 < 0.56) and the reduction in CBFv was not accompanied by\
  \ a reduction in cerebral blood volume. These results demonstrate that while cerebral\
  \ deoxygenation was associated with hyperventilation, it was not solely explained\
  \ by hypocapnia-induced reductions in CBFv. CCA revealed that a relative increase\
  \ in the venous contribution to NIRS explained a larger amount of variation in cerebral\
  \ oxygenation than reductions CBFv. \xA9 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
