abstract: "Background: Many patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have difficulties\
  \ in performing a second task during walking (i.e., dual task walking). Functional\
  \ near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a promising approach to study the presumed\
  \ contribution of dysfunction within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to such difficulties.\
  \ In this pilot study, we examined the feasibility of using a new portable and wireless\
  \ fNIRS device to measure PFC activity during different dual task walking protocols\
  \ in PD. Specifically, we tested whether PD patients were able to perform the protocol\
  \ and whether we were able to measure the typical fNIRS signal of neuronal activity.\
  \ Methods: We included 14 PD patients (age 71.2 \xB1 5.4 years, Hoehn and Yahr stage\
  \ II/III). The protocol consisted of five repetitions of three conditions: walking\
  \ while (i) counting forwards, (ii) serially subtracting, and (iii) reciting digit\
  \ spans. Ability to complete this protocol, perceived exertion, burden of the fNIRS\
  \ devices, and concentrations of oxygenated (O2Hb) and deoxygenated (HHb) hemoglobin\
  \ from the left and right PFC were measured. Results: Two participants were unable\
  \ to complete the protocol due to fatigue and mobility safety concerns. The remaining\
  \ 12 participants experienced no burden from the two fNIRS devices and completed\
  \ the protocol with ease. Bilateral PFC O2Hb concentrations increased during walking\
  \ while serially subtracting (left PFC 0.46 $\u03BC$mol/L, 95 % confidence interval\
  \ (CI) 0.12-0.81, right PFC 0.49 $\u03BC$mol/L, 95 % CI 0.14-0.84) and reciting\
  \ digit spans (left PFC 0.36 $\u03BC$mol/L, 95 % CI 0.03-0.70, right PFC 0.44 $\u03BC\
  $mol/L, 95 % CI 0.09-0.78) when compared to rest. HHb concentrations did not differ\
  \ between the walking tasks and rest. Conclusions: These findings suggest that a\
  \ new wireless fNIRS device is a feasible measure of PFC activity in PD during dual\
  \ task walking. Future studies should reduce the level of noise and inter-individual\
  \ variability to enable measuring differences in PFC activity between different\
  \ dual walking conditions and across health states."
