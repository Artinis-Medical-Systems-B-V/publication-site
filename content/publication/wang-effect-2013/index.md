abstract: "Background: Anemia disturbs hemorheological/hemodynamic properties, whereas\
  \ aerobic interval training (AIT) achieves a superior aerobic fitness in patients\
  \ with heart failure (HF). This study investigated whether AIT influences functional\
  \ capacity by modulating hemorheological/hemodynamic functions in HF patients with/without\
  \ anemia. Methods: Sixty HF patients were divided into non-anemic (HF-NA, hemoglobin\u2267\
  12 g/dL in women/\u226713 g/dL in men; n=30) and anemic (HF-A, hemoglobinb11 g/dL\
  \ in women/b12 g/dL in men; n=30) groups, and 30 normal counterparts were enrolled\
  \ as a control group. These HF patients performed AIT (3-minute intervals at 40%\
  \ and 80%VO2peak) on a bicycle ergometer for 30 min/day, 3 days/week for 12 weeks.\
  \ Erythrocyte rheological and central/peripheral hemodynamic characteristics were\
  \ determined by slit-flow ektacytometer and bioreactance-based device/near infrared\
  \ spectrometer, respectively. Results: In both HF-NA and HF-A groups, the AIT regimen\
  \ 1) reduced blood senescent/spherical erythrocyte counts, 2) diminished the values\
  \ of critical shear stresses for disaggregation and half-maximal deformation of\
  \ erythrocytes, 3) enhanced cardiac output during exercise, 4) heightened VO2peak\
  \ and O2 uptake efficiency slope (OUES), and 5) decreased plasma myeloperoxidase\
  \ and interleukin-6 levels. However, AIT increased the amounts of blood distributed\
  \ to the frontal cerebral lobe and vastus lateralis muscle during exercise in HF-NA\
  \ group but not in HF-A group. Additionally, HF-A group exhibited fewer the enhancements\
  \ of VO2peak and OUES caused by AIT than HF-NA group did. Conclusion: AIT improves\
  \ aerobic capacity and efficiency by depressing aggregability and enhancing deformability\
  \ of erythrocytes in patients with HF.However, anemic comorbidity attenuates the\
  \ adaptations of cerebral/muscular hemodynamic responses to exercise following this\
  \ regimen. \xA9 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
