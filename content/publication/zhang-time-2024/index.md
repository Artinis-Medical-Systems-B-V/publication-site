abstract: Thermal discomfort has a great dynamic impact on cognitive performance and
  occupants’ well-being during prolonged working. However, few studies have focused
  on the dynamic changes in cognitive functions and physiological responses under
  extreme heat stress. This study investigated the cognitive impairment over exposure
  time at various ambient temperatures, ranging from 21.15℃ WBGT to 38.93℃ WBGT, and
  its underlying physiological mechanism. 30 well-trained volunteers and 8 occupational
  operators participated in the experiments, with typical cognitive tests, ECG, and
  fNIRS measurements. Negative correlations were mainly observed between cognitive
  test accuracy, ECG RRI, ECG RMSSD, ECG HF/LF, fNIRS ALFF, fNIRS functional connectivity
  (CORRz, COH, PLV), and exposure time. This indicated that increased physical load,
  stress, and decreased regulation ability to sudden changes, cognitive resource input,
  and inter-regional brain cooperation were key factors contributing to cognitive
  impairments over time. A comprehensive performance index (CPI) was established by
  the weighted sum of accuracy in cognitive tests and physiological features of ECG
  and fNIRS. The weights suggested fNIRS ALFF, ECG RRI, and fNIRS functional connectivity
  could be potential biomarkers for cognitive assessment. A set of linear quantitative
  CPI curves over exposure time was supplied to calculate the thermal tolerance exposure
  time at various risk tolerances and ambient temperatures. A power-law relationship
  ( ) was observed between the thermal tolerance exposure time and the standardized
  temperature. This study provides a physiological insight into cognitive impairment
  under prolonged heat exposure, and quantitative thermal tolerance exposure curves
  to evaluate safe thermal working duration for both low-risk groups (officers and
  drivers) and high-risk groups (operators in industry)
