abstract: "Background: In patients with migraine, an abnormally large haemodynamic\
  \ response to epileptogenic visual stimulation has previously been observed, consistent\
  \ with the hypothesis of a cortical hyperexcitability. Ophthalmic filters have been\
  \ used in the treatment of migraine, and they reduce the haemodynamic response.Methods:\
  \ The present study used near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to characterise the haemodynamic\
  \ response to a range of visual stimuli in 20 patients with migraine (15 with aura\
  \ and 5 without) and paired controls in order to assess the effect of ophthalmic\
  \ treatment. In an initial study, the response to three stimuli (chequerboard, and\
  \ two gratings of different spatial frequency) was measured. In a second study,\
  \ using the mid-spatial frequency grating as stimulus, the response was compared\
  \ when precision spectral filters (PSF), grey filters or filters of control colour\
  \ were worn as ophthalmic lenses.Results: In the first study the time course of\
  \ the response differed between the groups. The difference was most distinct for\
  \ the grating with mid-spatial frequency. In the second study the PSF broadened\
  \ (normalised) the haemodynamic response in migraineurs relative to controls, consistent\
  \ with fMRI BOLD findings and suggesting a physiological mechanism for their reported\
  \ efficacy. In neither study were there differences in the amplitude of the response\
  \ between migraine and control groups or indeed between filters.Conclusion: The\
  \ time course of the functional response as measured by NIRS may be an effective\
  \ tool to track therapy with PSF and explore the mechanisms of visual stress in\
  \ migraine. \xA9 International Headache Society 2012."
