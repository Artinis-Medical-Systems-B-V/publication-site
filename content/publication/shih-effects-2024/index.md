abstract: 'Due to the widespread involvement of distributed collaboration triggered
  by COVID-19, it has become a new trend that has continued into the post-pandemic
  era. This study investigated collective performance within two collaborative environments
  (co-located and distancing settings) by assessing inter-brain synchrony patterns
  (IBS) among design collaborators using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. The
  preliminary study was conducted with three dyads who possessed 2â€“3 years of professional
  product design experience. Each dyad completed two designated design tasks in distinct
  settings. In the distributed condition, participants interacted through video conferencing
  in which they were allowed to communicate by verbalization and sketching using a
  shared digital whiteboard. To prevent the influences of different sketching tools
  on design outputs, we employed digital sketching for both environments. The interactions
  between collaborators were identified in three behaviors: verbal only, sketch only,
  and mixed communication (verbal and sketch). The consequences revealed a higher
  level of IBS when mixed communication took place in distributed conditions than
  in co-located conditions. Comparably, the occurrence of IBS increased when participants
  solely utilized sketching as the interaction approach within the co-located setting.
  A mixed communication method combining verbalization and sketching might lead to
  more coordinated cognitive processes when in physical isolation. Design collaborators
  are inclined to adjust their interaction behaviors in order to adapt to different
  design environments, strengthen the exchange of ideas, and construct design consensus.
  Overall, the present paper discussed the performance of virtual collaborative design
  based on a neurocognitive perspective, contributing valuable insights for the future
  intervention design that promotes effective virtual teamwork.'
