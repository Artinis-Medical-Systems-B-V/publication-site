abstract: 'Background The intricate role of pain in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI)
  makes the investigation of alterations in brain function during pain processing
  a critical yet underexplored topic. The aim of this study was to investigate fNIRS
  correlates of experimental pain and how these differed between adolescent patients
  engaging in NSSI and healthy controls. Methods 154 adolescent patients with NSSI
  and 48 healthy controls underwent a heat pain stimulation with linearly increasing
  temperature from 32 °C to max. 50 °C, during which fNIRS activity was recorded.
  Associations between fNIRS activity and pain perception (i.e. pain threshold, pain
  tolerance and pain intensity) were examined using linear mixed models and linear
  regression analyses. Results Across groups, we found a decrease in prefrontal oxygenation
  during increasing pain stimulation: Oxygenated hemoglobin was higher during baseline
  than during pain threshold (b = −0.36, p textless .001) and higher during pain threshold
  than during pain tolerance (b = −0.10, p textless .001). We did not find differential
  patterns of prefrontal oxygenation across the pain assessment between patients and
  healthy controls. Also, no association between pain intensity and fNIRS activity
  was found. Limitations fNIRS was only recorded in prefrontal regions and our design
  did not include a non-painful stimulation as a control condition. Conclusion While
  our study adds to the understanding of prefrontal hemodynamic changes associated
  with pain processing, it did not contribute further evidence to the few existing
  findings regarding altered neural processing of pain in adolescents engaging in
  NSSI.'
