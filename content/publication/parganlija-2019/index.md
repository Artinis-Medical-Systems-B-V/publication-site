abstract: "Purpose: During exercise in supine posture or under microgravity in space,\
  \ the gravity-dependent component of local blood pressure in leg muscles at upright\
  \ posture can be simulated by lower body negative pressure (LBNP). We hypothesized\
  \ that during resistive exercise LBNP favors oxygen availability in lower extremities,\
  \ benefiting energy levels and performance of working muscles. Methods: In permutated\
  \ crossover design, nine subjects performed a series of fifteen slow-paced concentric\
  \ (4\_s) and eccentric contractions (4\_s) without or with 40\_mmHg LBNP and 4\_\
  s pause between repetitions. The force at knee flexion was 6% of the one repetition\
  \ maximum (1-RM) and gradually increased to 60% 1RM in the first half of the individual\
  \ range of motion, subsequently remaining constant until full extension. Results:\
  \ During the low force periods of continuous exercise, LBNP enhanced the refill\
  \ of capillary blood measured by near infrared spectroscopy, amplifying the increase\
  \ of total haemoglobin by about 20\_\xB5mol/l (p < 0.01) and oxyhaemoglobin by about\
  \ 10\_\xB5mol/l (p < 0.01). During continuous exercise, LBNP induced a trend towards\
  \ a lower EMG increment. This LBNP effect was not found when the periods of low\
  \ forces at knee flexion were extended by 4\_s pauses. Increased respiratory oxygen\
  \ uptake (+ 0.1\_l/min, p < 0.05) indicated overall enhanced muscle energy turn-over.\
  \ Conclusions: Our results suggest stimulation of oxidative metabolism through LBNP\
  \ enables working muscles to meet the energy demands of intense exercise. Further\
  \ research is needed on the consequences for energy metabolism and the molecular\
  \ control of growth and differentiation."
