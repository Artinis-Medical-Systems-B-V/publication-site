abstract: Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and muscle oxygen saturation (StO2) are measurements
  utilized to assess macro- and microvascular function, respectively. Macro- and microvascular
  dysfunction may occur differently depending on the clinical condition. Since microvascular
  responsiveness can influence upstream conduit artery hemodynamics, the present study
  aimed to investigate whether a correlation between FMD and muscle StO2 parameters
  exists. Sixteen healthy, young individuals were enrolled in this study. Femoral
  artery FMD and tibial anterior muscle StO2 were evaluated by ultrasound and near-infrared
  spectroscopy, respectively. The FMD and muscle StO2 parameters were assessed by
  employing a vascular occlusion test (VOT). The oxygen resaturation rate was determined
  by calculating the upslope of StO2 immediately after occlusion and the magnitude
  of reperfusion as the difference between the highest and lowest StO2 value achieved
  during the reperfusion phase. The oxygen desaturation rate and the magnitude of
  desaturation during the VOT were also evaluated. A significant correlation between
  the FMD and oxygen resaturation rate (r = 0.628; p = 0.009), magnitude of reperfusion
  (r = 0.568; p = 0.022), oxygen desaturation rate (r = −0.509; p = 0.044), and magnitude
  of desaturation (r = 0.644; p = 0.007) was observed. This study demonstrated a moderate
  association between the femoral artery FMD and tibial anterior StO2 parameters in
  young individuals.
