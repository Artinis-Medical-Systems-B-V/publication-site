abstract: 'Purpose: Cerebral palsy (CP) is a common pediatric motor disability characterized
  by motor impairments and spasticity. This study assesses the feasibility of employing
  near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to objectively evaluate muscle spasticity in children
  with CP undergoing botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) treatment.  Methods: Three participants
  aged 5–16 years with spastic lower limbs were monitored for changes in the tissue
  oxygenation index (TOI%) and spasticity levels using the Modified Ashworth Scale
  (MAS) over 6 months. NIRS measurements were collected at baseline and several intervals
  following BoNT-A administration.  Results: Transient increases in TOI% were observed
  during the first 2–4 weeks post-injection, coinciding with reductions in spasticity.
  However, by 6 months, TOI% values experienced a moderate decline.  Conclusions:
  This descriptive analysis highlights the potential of NIRS as a non-invasive tool
  for real-time monitoring of muscle spasticity treatment efficacy. Further studies
  with larger sample sizes are needed to validate these findings and establish NIRS
  as a complement to existing clinical tools for muscle spasticity evaluation and
  management.'
