abstract: "The aim of this study was to evaluate the acute effects of light-emitting\
  \ diode therapy (LEDT) on cardiopulmonary adjustments and muscle oxygenation dynamics\
  \ during transition to moderate exercise, as well as in glucose and lactate levels\
  \ in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Sixteen individuals with T2DM\
  \ (age 55.1\xB15.4 years) performed four separate tests receiving LEDT or placebo\
  \ in random order, at intervals of at least 14 days. A light-emitting diode array\
  \ (50GaAIAs LEDs, 850nm, 75mW per diode) was used to perform LEDT bilaterally on\
  \ the quadriceps femoris and triceps surae muscles for 40s at each site. After,\
  \ a moderate cycling exercise was performed and oxygen uptake, muscular deoxyhemoglobin,\
  \ heart rate and cardiac output were measured. Lactate and glucose levels were measured\
  \ before LEDT/placebo and after the exercise. The LEDT decreased the glucose levels\
  \ after the exercise compared with values before LEDT (173.7\xB161.0 to 143.5\xB1\
  53.5 mg/dl, P=0.02) and it did not affect the cardiopulmonary and hemodynamic adjustments\
  \ in exercise, as well as lactate levels in both groups. In conclusion, the LEDT\
  \ in combination with moderate exercise acutely decreased the glucose levels in\
  \ men with T2DM."
