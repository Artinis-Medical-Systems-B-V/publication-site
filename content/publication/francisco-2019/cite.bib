 abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the acute effects of light-emitting diode therapy (LEDT) on cardiopulmonary adjustments and muscle oxygenation dynamics during transition to moderate exercise, as well as in glucose and lactate levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Sixteen individuals with T2DM (age 55.1±5.4 years) performed four separate tests receiving LEDT or placebo in random order, at intervals of at least 14 days. A light-emitting diode array (50GaAIAs LEDs, 850nm, 75mW per diode) was used to perform LEDT bilaterally on the quadriceps femoris and triceps surae muscles for 40s at each site. After, a moderate cycling exercise was performed and oxygen uptake, muscular deoxyhemoglobin, heart rate and cardiac output were measured. Lactate and glucose levels were measured before LEDT/placebo and after the exercise. The LEDT decreased the glucose levels after the exercise compared with values before LEDT (173.7±61.0 to 143.5±53.5 mg/dl, P=0.02) and it did not affect the cardiopulmonary and hemodynamic adjustments in exercise, as well as lactate levels in both groups. In conclusion, the LEDT in combination with moderate exercise acutely decreased the glucose levels in men with T2DM.},
