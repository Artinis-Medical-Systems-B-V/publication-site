abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine how the work rate (WR) influences
  whole-body metabolic rate (MR) and more local measures of intensity (i.e., pole
  power, joint power, and triceps brachii (TB) and vastus lateralis (VL) tissue saturation
  index (TSI)) across skating style sub-techniques in cross-country skiing (XCS).
  Five-minute efforts were performed at a range of submaximal speeds at constant inclines
  of 2% for G4, 5% for G3, and 12% for G2. Pole forces and 3D motion capture were
  used to calculate pole, elbow, and shoulder power. TSI in the TB and VL muscles
  was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy. There was a significant interaction
  effect of WR and sub-technique on MR (p textless 0.001), with a steeper slope in
  G4 followed by G3 and G2. Similar interaction effects were evident for shoulder
  power (p textless 0.001), but neither for elbow power (p = 0.512) nor for arm or
  leg tissue saturation (p = 0.766). Relative pole and arm power contributions were
  independent of WR but differed between sub-techniques. Both VL and TB had greater
  TSI in G4 (p = 0.025) and G3 (p textless 0.001), respectively, compared to G2, and
  the triceps brachii had a ∼15 ± 7% (p textless 0.001) greater TSI than the vastus
  lateralis across sub-techniques. Differences in WR-induced responses on various
  metabolic and mechanical responses across sub-techniques demonstrate the necessity
  of a more nuanced view on exercise load and intensity, especially on the local joint
  and muscle level, in XCS.
