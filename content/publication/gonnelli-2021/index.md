abstract: "Purpose: Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) is commonly used in\
  \ neuromuscular rehabilitation protocols, and its parameters selection substantially\
  \ affects the characteristics of muscle activation. Here, we investigated the effects\
  \ of short pulse width (200 \xB5s) and higher intensity (short-high) NMES or long\
  \ pulse width (1000 \xB5s) and lower intensity (long-low) NMES on muscle mechanical\
  \ output and fractional oxygen extraction. Muscle contractions were elicited with\
  \ 100 Hz stimulation frequency, and the initial torque output was matched by adjusting\
  \ stimulation intensity. Methods: Fourteen able-bodied and six spinal cord-injured\
  \ (SCI) individuals participated in the study. The NMES protocol (75 isometric contractions,\
  \ 1-s on\u20133-s off) targeting the knee extensors was performed with long-low\
  \ or short-high NMES applied over the midline between anterior superior iliac spine\
  \ and patella protrusion in two different days. Muscle work was estimated by torque\u2013\
  time integral, contractile properties by rate of torque development and half-relaxation\
  \ time, and vastus lateralis fractional oxygen extraction was assessed by Near-Infrared\
  \ Spectroscopy (NIRS). Results: Torque\u2013time integral elicited by the two NMES\
  \ paradigms was similar throughout the stimulation protocol, with differences ranging\
  \ between 1.4% (p = 0.877; able-bodied, mid-part of the protocol) and 9.9% (p =\
  \ 0.147; SCI, mid-part of the protocol). Contractile properties were also comparable\
  \ in the two NMES paradigms. However, long-low NMES resulted in higher fractional\
  \ oxygen extraction in able-bodied (+ 36%; p = 0.006). Conclusion: Long-low and\
  \ short-high NMES recruited quadriceps femoris motor units that demonstrated similar\
  \ contractile and fatigability properties. However, long-low NMES conceivably resulted\
  \ in the preferential recruitment of vastus lateralis muscle fibers as detected\
  \ by NIRS."
