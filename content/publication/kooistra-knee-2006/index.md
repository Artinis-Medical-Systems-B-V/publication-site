abstract: "Recently, fatigability and muscle oxygen consumption (mVO2) during sustained\
  \ isometric contractions were found to be less at shorter (30\xB0 knee angle; 0\xB0\
  \ = full extension) compared to longer knee extensor muscle lengths (90\xB0) and,\
  \ at low torques, less in the rectus femoris (RF) muscle than in the astus lateralis\
  \ and medialis. In the present study we hypothesized that these findings could be\
  \ accounted for by a knee angle- and a muscle-dependent activation respectively.\
  \ On two experimental days rectified surface EMG (rsEMG) was obtained as a measure\
  \ of muscle activation in nine healthy young males. In addition, on day 1 maximal\
  \ torque capacity (MTC) was carefully determined using superimposed nerve stimulation\
  \ on brief high intensity contractions (> 70%MVC) at 30, 60 and 90\xB0 knee angles.\
  \ On day 2, subjects performed longer lasting isometric contractions (10-70%MTC)\
  \ while mVO2 was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). At 30\xB0, maximal\
  \ m VO2 was reached significantly later (11.0 s \xB1 6.5 s) and was 57.9 \xB1 8.3%\
  \ less (average \xB1 SD, across intensities and muscles) than m VO2 at 60 and 90\xB0\
  \ (p < 0.05). However, rsEMG was on average only 18.0 \xB1 11.8% (p = 0.062) less\
  \ at the start of the contraction at 30\xB0. At 10%MTC at all knee angles, maximal\
  \ m VO2 of the RF occurred significantly later (28.8 \xB1 36.0 s) and showed a significantly\
  \ smaller increase in rsEMG compared to both vasti. In conclusion, it is unlikely\
  \ that the tendency for less intense muscle activation could fully account for the\
  \ \u223C60% lower oxygen consumption at 30\xB0, but the later increase in RFm VO2\
  \ seemed to be caused by a less strong activation of the RF. \xA9 Springer-Verlag\
