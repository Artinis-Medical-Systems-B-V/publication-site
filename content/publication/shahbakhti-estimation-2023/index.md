abstract: 'Objective: The employment of wearable systems for continuous monitoring
  of vital signs is increasing. However, due to substantial susceptibility of conventional
  bio-signals recorded by wearable systems to motion artifacts, estimation of the
  respiratory rate (RR) during physical activities is a challenging task. Alternatively,
  functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) can be used, which has been proven
  less vulnerable to the subject’s movements. This paper proposes a fusion-based method
  for estimating RR during bicycling from fNIRS signals recorded by a wearable system.
  Methods: Firstly, five respiratory modulations are extracted, based on amplitude,
  frequency, and intensity of the oxygenated hemoglobin concentration (O2Hb) signal.
  Secondly, the dominant frequency of each modulation is computed using the fast Fourier
  transform. Finally, dominant frequencies of all modulations are fused, based on
  averaging, to estimate RR. The performance of the proposed method was validated
  on 22 young healthy subjects, whose respiratory and fNIRS signals were simultaneously
  recorded during a bicycling task, and compared against a zero delay Fourier domain
  band-pass filter. Results: The comparison between results obtained by the proposed
  method and band-pass filtering indicated the superiority of the former, with a lower
  mean absolute error (3.66 vs. 11.06 breaths per minute, ptextless0.05). The proposed
  fusion strategy also outperformed RR estimations based on the analysis of individual
  modulation. Significance: This study orients towards the practical limitations of
  traditional bio-signals for RR estimation during physical activities.'
