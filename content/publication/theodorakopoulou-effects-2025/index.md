abstract: 'Introduction Vascular dysfunction is a hallmark of chronic kidney disease
  (CKD), with previous studies showing progressively deteriorating microvascular reactivity
  in skeletal muscles with advancing CKD stages. Additionally, cognitive impairment
  is quite common in CKD patients, as significant determinants of brain activation,
  i.e., cerebral perfusion and oxygenation, are significantly impaired. The aim of
  this analysis was to investigate, for the first time, the effects of proteinuria
  on skeletal muscle and cerebral oxygenation, as well as on muscle microvascular
  reactivity in patients with pre-dialysis CKD. Methods A total of 56 patients with
  pre-dialysis CKD were included in this post-hoc, exploratory analysis and stratified
  based on the presence of proteinuria (urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio textgreater
  200 mg/g). Patients with and without proteinuria were matched in a 1:1 ratio for
  age, sex, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Near-infrared spectroscopy
  was used to measure muscle and cerebral oxygenation at rest and after stimulation
  (occlusion-reperfusion and handgrip exercise). Results The two groups were similar
  in terms of age, eGFR, body mass index, and major comorbidities. Muscle oxygenation
  did not differ between study groups at rest and during occlusion; however, proteinuric
  CKD patients presented a trend toward lower tissue saturation index (TSI) during
  reperfusion (10-second slope: 1.36±0.69 vs. 1.67±0.83, p=0.143) and hyperemic response
  (7.26±3.98 vs. 8.47±4.52, p=0.296). Regarding cerebral oxygenation, proteinuric
  patients displayed lower average response during exercise (oxygenated hemoglobin
  [O2Hb]: 0.92±0.78 vs. 1.49±0.86, p=0.012; hemoglobin difference [Hbdiff]: 1.41±0.96
  vs. 1.98±1.12; p=0.044). The average response in total hemoglobin (tHb) (an index
  of regional blood volume) was also lower (0.43±0.98 vs. 1.00±0.85, p=0.023), but
  no between-group differences in deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb) (an index of oxygen
  extraction capacity) were observed. Conclusions In this exploratory analysis, CKD
  patients with proteinuria showed signs of attenuated cerebral oxygenation during
  a mild physical task and a possible trend toward modest impairments in skeletal
  muscle oxidative capacity and microvascular reactivity.'
