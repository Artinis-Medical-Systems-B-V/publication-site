abstract: "Muscle ischemia and reperfusion induced by ischemic preconditioning (IPC)\
  \ can improve performance in various activities. However, the underlying mechanisms\
  \ are still poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects\
  \ of IPC on muscle hemodynamics and oxygen (O2) uptake during repeated maximal contractions.\
  \ In a cross-over, randomized, single-blind study, 10 strength-trained men performed\
  \ 5 sets of 5 maximal voluntary knee extensions of the right leg on an isokinetic\
  \ dynamometer, preceded by either IPC of the right lower limb (3\xD75-min compression/5-min\
  \ reperfusion cycles at 200 mm Hg) or sham (20 mm Hg). Changes in deoxyhemoglobin,\
  \ expressed as a percentage of arterial occlusion, and total hemoglobin ([THb])\
  \ concentrations of the vastus lateralis muscle were monitored continuously by near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy. Differences between IPC and sham were analyzed using Cohen's effect\
  \ size (ES) \xB1 90% confidence limits, and magnitude-based inferences. Compared\
  \ with sham, IPC likely increased muscle blood volume at rest (\u2191[THb], 46.5%;\
  \ ES, 0.56; 90% confidence limits for ES, -0.21, 1.32). During exercise, peak force\
  \ was almost certainly higher (11.8%; ES, 0.37; 0.27, 0.47), average force was very\
  \ likely higher (12.6%; ES, 0.47; 0.29, 0.66), and average muscle O2 uptake was\
  \ possibly increased (15.8%; ES, 0.36; -0.07, 0.79) after IPC. In the recovery periods\
  \ between contractions, IPC also increased blood volume after sets 1 (23.6%; ES,\
  \ 0.30; -0.05, 0.65) and 5 (25.1%; ES, 0.32; 0.09, 0.55). Three cycles of IPC immediately\
  \ increased muscle perfusion and O2 uptake, conducive to higher repeated force capacity\
  \ in strength-trained athletes. This maneuver therefore appears relevant to enhancing\
  \ exercise training stimulus."
