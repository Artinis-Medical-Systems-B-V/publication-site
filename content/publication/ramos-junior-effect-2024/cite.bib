 abstract = {Introduction: Aging is associated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO). Curcumin has been shown to increase NO bioavailability due to its ability to neutralize ROS, preventing oxidative stress. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of curcumin intake on skeletal muscle oxygen parameters and exercise tolerance in response to exercise in older people. Changes in circulating levels of NO metabolites were also investigated. Methods: Older subjects consumed 10 g of turmeric root extract from Curcuma longa L. (containing 95.33% of the total curcuminoids) or placebo in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study. A time of 2 h after ingestion, the participants performed one set of rhythmic handgrip exercise until the limit of tolerance, followed by 5 min of recovery. During exercise and exercise recovery, skeletal muscle oxygen saturation parameters were recorded. Results: During exercise, the amplitude of deoxyhemoglobin was greater after curcumin intake compared to placebo (CUR: 13.11 ± 9.52 vs. PLA: 10.22 ± 8.39 μM, p = 0.030). Furthermore, a faster skeletal muscle oxygen resaturation during exercise recovery was observed after curcumin compared to placebo (CUR: 1.01 ± 0.65 vs. PLA: 0.32 ± 0.20%.s−1, p = 0.004). These results were associated with significant changes in plasma nitrite (CUR: 6.82 ± 11.68 vs. PLA: −4.94 ± 17.28%, p = 0.028). There was no statistical difference in the total hemoglobin, exercise time until fatigue, and plasma nitrate between groups. Conclusions: The present study suggests that curcumin improves muscle oxygenation status at the capillary level in older adults by possibly improving muscle oxygen extraction and/or delivery, with no effect on exercise tolerance.},
