abstract: 'Introduction: Aging is associated with increased reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) and reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO). Curcumin has been shown
  to increase NO bioavailability due to its ability to neutralize ROS, preventing
  oxidative stress. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of curcumin
  intake on skeletal muscle oxygen parameters and exercise tolerance in response to
  exercise in older people. Changes in circulating levels of NO metabolites were also
  investigated. Methods: Older subjects consumed 10 g of turmeric root extract from
  Curcuma longa L. (containing 95.33% of the total curcuminoids) or placebo in a randomized,
  double-blind, crossover study. A time of 2 h after ingestion, the participants performed
  one set of rhythmic handgrip exercise until the limit of tolerance, followed by
  5 min of recovery. During exercise and exercise recovery, skeletal muscle oxygen
  saturation parameters were recorded. Results: During exercise, the amplitude of
  deoxyhemoglobin was greater after curcumin intake compared to placebo (CUR: 13.11
  ± 9.52 vs. PLA: 10.22 ± 8.39 μM, p = 0.030). Furthermore, a faster skeletal muscle
  oxygen resaturation during exercise recovery was observed after curcumin compared
  to placebo (CUR: 1.01 ± 0.65 vs. PLA: 0.32 ± 0.20%.s−1, p = 0.004). These results
  were associated with significant changes in plasma nitrite (CUR: 6.82 ± 11.68 vs.
  PLA: −4.94 ± 17.28%, p = 0.028). There was no statistical difference in the total
  hemoglobin, exercise time until fatigue, and plasma nitrate between groups. Conclusions:
  The present study suggests that curcumin improves muscle oxygenation status at the
  capillary level in older adults by possibly improving muscle oxygen extraction and/or
  delivery, with no effect on exercise tolerance.'
