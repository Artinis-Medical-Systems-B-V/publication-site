abstract: "The purpose of this study was to investigate if prefrontal cortex (PFC)\
  \ oxygenation during incremental exercise is altered among cardiovascular disease\
  \ (CVD) patients who completed 6 weeks of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation\
  \ (CR). Nineteen (male = 14, female = 5; 65.5 \xB1 11.5 years) participants from\
  \ an outpatient CR program were enrolled in the study. Each participant completed\
  \ a submaximal graded treadmill evaluation at intake and again upon completion of\
  \ 18 individualized CR sessions. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) imaging\
  \ was used to measure left- and right- PFC (LPFC and RPFC) oxygenation parameters\
  \ during the submaximal exercise evaluations. Patients showed improvements in cardiorespiratory\
  \ capacity (pre 5.5 \xB1 2.5 vs. post 6.9 \xB1 2.8 metabolic equivalents (METs)).\
  \ A significant decrease in LPFC and RPFC oxygenation was observed during the post-CR\
  \ exercise test compared to pre-CR. CVD patients enrolled in 6 weeks of CR showed\
  \ significant improvements in functional capacity along with decreased cortical\
  \ oxygenation during submaximal exercise. Exercise training may cause distribution\
  \ of cortical resources to motor regions that support sustained exercise."
