abstract: Introduction Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) offers valuable insights
  into exercise performance and enables the investigation of cerebral and muscular
  hemodynamic impairments associated with aging. This study aimed to examine cerebral
  and muscular hemodynamic adjustments during and after an aerobic exercise session
  in young adults and older adults. Methods Twenty young adults and 20 older adults
  performed moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (60%–70% of maximum heart rate) on
  a treadmill for 10 min, followed by 15 min of passive recovery. NIRS devices continuously
  monitored oxyhemoglobin (O 2 Hb) and deoxyhemoglobin (HHb) levels in the prefrontal
  cortex (PFC) and vastus lateralis (VL) and biceps brachii muscles (more and less
  active muscles, respectively). A 3-min seated baseline measurement was recorded
  before the exercise session. Changes in NIRS data were calculated by subtracting
  the values in each minute of exercise and recovery from baseline measurements. Results
  In young adults, but not older adults, HHb in the VL muscle increased throughout
  the exercise. Additionally, after the first minute of exercise, young adults exhibited
  a continuous rise in PFC O 2 Hb until the seventh minute, followed by stabilization;
  in contrast, older adults showed no significant change in PFC O 2 Hb. During recovery,
  young adults demonstrated a decline in PFC O 2 Hb after the second minute, persisting
  until the end of the recovery period. No significant adjustment was found in the
  muscular hemodynamics during the recovery period. Conclusion Cerebral and muscular
  hemodynamic changes indicate that young adults exhibit greater adjustments to exercise
  demands than older adults. Aging appears to impair cortical and muscular oxygenation
  during aerobic exercise, which may negatively affect exercise performance. These
  findings enhance our understanding of age-related declines in muscle and cerebral
  oxygen delivery and utilization, potentially contributing to reduced exercise capacity
  in older adults.
