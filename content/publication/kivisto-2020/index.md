abstract: "Purpose: To investigate the replacement of conventional grid by air gap\
  \ in axiolateral hip radiographs. The optimal air gap distance was studied with\
  \ respect to radiation dose and image quality using phantom images, as well as 26\
  \ patient axiolateral hip radiographs. Methods: The CDRAD phantom, along with polymethylmethacrylate\
  \ slabs with thicknesses of 10.0, 14.6, and 20.0\_cm was employed. The inverse image\
  \ quality index and dose area product (DAP), as well as their combination, so called\
  \ figure-of-merit (FOM) parameter, were evaluated for these images, with air gaps\
  \ from 20 to 50\_cm in increments of 10\_cm. Images were compared to those acquired\
  \ using a conventional grid utilized in hip radiography. Radiation dose was measured\
  \ and kept constant at the surface of the detector by using a reference dosimeter.\
  \ Verbal consent was asked from 26 patients to participate to the study. Air gap\
  \ distances from 20 to 50\_cm and tube current-time products from 8 to 50\_mAs were\
  \ employed. Exposure index, DAP, as well as patient height and weight were recorded.\
  \ Two radiologists evaluated the image quality of 26 hip axiolateral projection\
  \ images on a 3-point nondiagnostic \u2014 good/sufficiently good \u2014 too good\
  \ scale. Source-to-image distance of 200\_cm and peak tube voltage of 90\_kVp were\
  \ used in both studies. Results and conclusion: Based on the phantom study, it is\
  \ possible to reduce radiation dose by replacing conventional grid with air gap\
  \ without compromising image quality. The optimal air gap distance appears to be\
  \ 30\_cm, based on the FOM analysis. Patient study corroborates this observation,\
  \ as sufficiently good image quality was found in 24 of 26 patient radiographs,\
  \ with 7 of 26 images obtained with 30\_cm air gap. Thus, air gap method, with an\
  \ air gap distance of 30\_cm, is recommended in axiolateral hip radiography."
