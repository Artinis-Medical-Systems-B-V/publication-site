abstract: "The purpose of this study was to examine whether circulatory occlusion\
  \ of the hand impacts on regional forearm muscle haemodynamics as determined by\
  \ the near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) venous occlusion technique (NIRSVOT). Twenty-five\
  \ young, healthy participants (18 males and 7 females; 28 \xB1 4 years; 71 \xB1\
  \ 7 kg) completed two experimental protocols that were performed on the dominant\
  \ arm: (1) a series of five venous occlusion trials with a suprasystolic cuff (>260\
  \ mmHg) applied to the wrist and (2) five venous occlusion trials without hand-occlusion.\
  \ Both protocols were performed twice in a counterbalanced manner. NIRS data were\
  \ obtained from the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) muscle using a dual wavelength,\
  \ continuouswave spectrophotometer. FDS muscle blood flow (QFDS), vascular conductance\
  \ (CFDS), O2 consumption (VFDS), and venous O2 saturation (SvO2) were calculated\
  \ from NIRS data during the initial 5 s of venous occlusion. Circulatory occlusion\
  \ of the hand via wrist cuffing significantly (P < 0.05) reduced QFDS (-36 \xB1\
  \ 23%), CFDS (-37 \xB1 23%), Vo2FDS (-14 \xB1 31%) and SvO2 (-14 \xB1 12%). These\
  \ findings indicate that hand-occlusion, via wrist cuffing, adversely impacts on\
  \ regional forearm haemodynamics as determined by the NIRS-VOT. Consequently, it\
  \ is recommended that future investigators avoid hand-occlusion when using the NIRS-VOT\
  \ to quantify spontaneous haemodynamics of regional forearm muscle."
