abstract: Growing evidence demonstrates the importance of environmental quality for
  human health and wellbeing. Environmental psychology can inform planning and design
  of future environments, but previous research often used simulated settings, limiting
  ecological validity. To bridge this gap and enable studies in real environments,
  a new laboratory (SENSOLA) has been built at the Swedish University of Agricultural
  Sciences. The laboratory is designed to facilitate studies on human-environment
  interactions in real environments, with a particular focus on psychophysiology using
  wearable sensors. An important prerequisite of the endeavor is the ability to synchronize
  environmental data with biomarkers and participants’ self-reports over time. In
  this methodological paper, we describe the creation and implementation of the SENSOLA
  laboratory. Drawing on experiences gained from the first ten studies conducted within
  the laboratory, we summarize key considerations for conducting research in field
  settings. We discuss various methodological approaches and procedural considerations,
  highlighting challenges and possibilities, to serve as a peer-reviewed guideline
  for future studies in the lab and elsewhere.
