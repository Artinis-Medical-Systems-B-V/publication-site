abstract: "We compared responses from postmenopausal women living a sedentary lifestyle\
  \ (n = 15; Mean age= 59; SD = 4.2) to a single bout of water- or land-based exercise\
  \ with respect to ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), lactate concentration, and\
  \ muscle oxygen saturation. Each participant was randomly assigned to a single water-\
  \ or land-based 50-minute bout of combined aerobic and resistance exercise. Blood\
  \ samples were collected to detect pre- and post-exercise lactate concentration.\
  \ Total hemoglobin, deoxidized hemoglobin, and the percentage change in the total\
  \ oxygen saturation index (TSI%) of the rectus femoris were detected by means of\
  \ near-infrared spectroscopy. We found similar RPE at various stages of land- and\
  \ water-based exercise, and a similar change in lactate concentration in these environments\
  \ (in water: 4.35 \xB1 1.49 mol/L; on land: 3.62 \xB1 1.18 mol/L). However, the\
  \ reduction in HHb response was less pronounced after water-based exercise, and\
  \ TSI% increased on land but decreased in water, with the magnitude of this change\
  \ much higher on land. For similar RPE and lactate concentration, the oxygen saturation\
  \ in the exercising muscles decreased in water, suggesting higher oxygen consumption\
  \ in water than on land."
