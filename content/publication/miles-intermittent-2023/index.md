abstract: Purpose To compare deoxygenation of the sternocleidomastoid, scalenes, and
  diaphragm/intercostals (Dia/IC) during submaximal intermittent neck flexion (INF)
  versus submaximal inspiratory threshold loading (ITL) in healthy adults.  Methods
  Fourteen participants performed a randomized, cross-over, repeated measures design.
  After evaluation of maximal inspiratory pressures (MIP) and maximum voluntary contraction
  (MVC) for isometric neck flexion, participants were randomly assigned to submaximal
  ITL or INF until task failure. At least 2 days later, they performed the submaximal
  exercises in the opposite order. ITL or INF targeted 50 ± 5% of the MIP or MVC,
  respectively, until task failure. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was applied
  to evaluate changes of deoxy-hemoglobin (ΔHHb), oxy-hemoglobin (ΔO2Hb), total hemoglobin
  (ΔtHb), and tissue saturation of oxygen (StO2) of the sternocleidomastoid, scalenes,
  and Dia/IC. Breathlessness and perceived exertion were evaluated using Borg scales.  Results
  Initially during INF, sternocleidomastoid HHb slope was greatest compared to the
  scalenes and Dia/IC. At isotime (6.5–7 min), ΔtHb (a marker of blood volume) and
  ΔO2Hb of the sternocleidomastoid were higher during INF than ITL. Sternocleidomastoid
  HHb, O2Hb, and tHb during INF also increased at quartile and task failure timepoints.
  In contrast, scalene ΔO2Hb was higher during ITL than INF at isotime. Further, Dia/IC
  O2Hb and tHb increased during ITL at the third quartile and at task failure. Borg
  scores were lower at task failure during INF compared to ITL.  Conclusion Intermittent
  INF induces significant metabolic activity of the sternocleidomastoid and a lower
  perception of effort, which may provide an alternative inspiratory muscle training
  approach for mechanically ventilated patients.
