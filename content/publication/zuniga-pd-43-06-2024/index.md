abstract: 'INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability
  (HRV) are established measures related to cardiovascular disease (CVD), a known
  risk factor correlated with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and overactive bladder
  (OAB). However, there is no standardized methodology to relate changes in HR and
  HRV to gold standard methods of uroflowmetry. Objective: To describe a methodology
  and test feasibility of synchronous, noninvasive measurement of HR and HRV, detrusor
  activity, and uroflowmetry.  METHODS: Equipment: the portable, wireless, continuous
  wave near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) instruments, Poralite and Portamon (Artinis
  Medical Systems), use NIR light at 785, 808, and 830 nanometers. Three optodes on
  each device are set at 30, 35, and 40 mm from the receiver and collect raw optical
  data at a sampling time of 25-100Hz. Protocol: Study subjects with and without LUTS
  provided data on demographics, medical history, and voiding symptoms through the
  validated International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ). Subjects
  then wore the Portalite over the frontal cortex (HR and HRV monitoring) and the
  Portamon suprapubically (detrusor oxygenation monitoring). Device recording was
  linked synchronously to a uroflow scale. Subjects were recorded for a 1-minute pre-void
  baseline, during voiding, and a 1-minute post-void baseline.  RESULTS: N=26 (12
  controls, 14 cases) completed the protocol. Among controls versus cases, average
  age was 34+6 and 58+18 (ptextless0.01), 9 (75%) and 13 (93%) subjects were women
  (p=0.21), and body mass index was 27+6 and 30+5 (p=0.19). Average ICIQ score was
  1.7+1.7 and 15+5.7 (ptextless0.01) among women and 2.3+2.1 and 12 among men. The
  NIRS instruments accurately monitored HR, HRV, detrusor oxygenation, and uroflowmetry
  in all cases. A representative measurement is seen in Figure 1.  CONCLUSIONS: Synchronous,
  wireless monitoring of HR, HRV, detrusor activity, and uroflowmetry using non-invasive
  NIRS devices is feasible and generates reproducible, accurate results. This method
  will allow for larger scale studies using NIRS for performing noninvasive uroflowmetry
  and analyzing the impact of normal versus pathologic cardiovascular function on
  LUTS and OAB.'
