abstract: "PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare the acute effects of high-intensity\
  \ interval exercise (HIIE) with moderate-intensity continuous exercise (MICE) on\
  \ arterial stiffness, cerebral blood flow and cognitive function in young smokers.\
  \ METHODS: Young smokers (23.1 years & 7.2 pack years) were randomly assigned to\
  \ either MICE (n=5) or HIIE (n=4) group. MICE was implemented at 70% of HRmax for\
  \ 30 minutes. HIIE was performed at 70% and 90% of HRmax for 24 minutes. Central\
  \ artery stiffness was assessed by aortic pulse wave velocity (cfPWV), augmentation\
  \ index (AIx) at pre and post-exercise, and 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 24 hours\
  \ following the exercises. Cerebral blood flow was continuously monitored using\
  \ near-infrared spectroscopy technique before and during exercise, and at 30 minutes,\
  \ 1 hour, 2 hours, and 24 hours following the exercises. Cognitive function was\
  \ assessed by Stroop Color-Word test at pre-exercise, and 30 minutes and 24 hours\
  \ following the exercises. RESULTS: There was no significant group by time interaction\
  \ in cfPWV,AIx, cerebral blood flow (HbO2) level, and cognitive function. Compared\
  \ with MICE, cfPWV was increased (p=.01) at 30 minutes but AIx was decreased (p=.02)\
  \ at 1 hour following HIIE. When MICE and HIIE combined, arterial stiffness and\
  \ cerebral blood flow measures, and cognitive function parameters were improved\
  \ following even one-bout of exercise (p\u2264.049). Change in AIx was associated\
  \ with change in cognitive function at 30 minutes following the exercises (r=.69,\
  \ p=.06). CONCLUSIONS: Even one-bout of either MIIE or HIIT acutely improves aortic\
  \ wave reflection, cerebral blood flow and cognitive function in young smokers.\
  \ The intensity of aerobic exercise does not seem to make meaningful differences\
  \ in the positive effects on arterial stiffness, cerebral blood flow, and cognitive\
  \ function in young smokers if both exercises have the same volume."
