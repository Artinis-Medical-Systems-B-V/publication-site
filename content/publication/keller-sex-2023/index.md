abstract: Men exhibit greater values of reactive hyperemia than women even when controlling
  for the magnitude of desaturation during transient ischemia. Factors other than
  the ischemic vasodilatory stimulus, such as skeletal muscle mass and quality, likely
  provoke the commonly reported sex differences in reactive hyperemia measured by
  near-infrared spectroscopy. ,   Men and women exhibit different near-infrared spectroscopy
  (NIRS) outcomes in response to vascular occlusion tests (VOT), which may be due
  to phenotypic characteristics or different degrees of desaturation during ischemia.
  The minimum skeletal muscle tissue oxygenation (StO 2min ) observed during a VOT
  may be the primary determinant of reactive hyperemic (RH) responses. Our purpose
  was to determine the contribution StO 2min and participant characteristics including
  adipose tissue thickness (ATT), lean body mass (LBM), muscular strength, and limb
  circumference to NIRS-derived indexes of RH. Also, we aimed to determine if matching
  StO 2min would eliminate NIRS-VOT sex differences. Thirty-one young adults completed
  one or two VOTs during which the vastus lateralis was continuously assessed for
  StO 2 . The men and women each completed a standard VOT with a 5-min ischemic phase.
  The men completed a second VOT with a shortened ischemic phase to produce a matching
  StO 2min to the minimum of the women observed during the standard VOT. Mean sex
  differences were determined with t tests, and relative contributions were assessed
  with multiple regression and model comparison approaches. During the 5-min ischemic
  phase, the men exhibited greater upslopes (1.97 ± 0.66 vs. 1.23 ± 0.59%·s −1 ) and
  greater StO 2max than the women (80.3 ± 4.17 vs. 76.2 ± 2.86%). Analysis revealed
  StO 2min was a greater contributor to upslope than sex and/or ATT. For StO 2max
  , sex was the only significant predictor ( r 2 = 0.26, men ∼4.09% textgreater women).
  Experimentally matching StO 2min did not eliminate the sex differences in upslope
  or StO 2max , suggesting that characteristics other than the degree of desaturation
  primarily provoke sex differences in RH.  NEW & NOTEWORTHY Men exhibit greater values
  of reactive hyperemia than women even when controlling for the magnitude of desaturation
  during transient ischemia. Factors other than the ischemic vasodilatory stimulus,
  such as skeletal muscle mass and quality, likely provoke the commonly reported sex
  differences in reactive hyperemia measured by near-infrared spectroscopy.
