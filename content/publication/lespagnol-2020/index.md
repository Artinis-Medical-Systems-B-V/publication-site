abstract: "Aims/hypothesis: Early compromised endothelial function challenges the\
  \ ability of individuals with type 1 diabetes to perform normal physical exercise.\
  \ The exact mechanisms underlying this vascular limitation remain unknown, but may\
  \ involve either formation or metabolism of nitric oxide (NO), a major vasodilator,\
  \ whose activity is known to be compromised by oxidative stress. Methods: Muscle\
  \ microvascular reactivity (near-infrared spectroscopy) to an incremental exhaustive\
  \ bout of exercise was assessed in 22 adults with uncomplicated type 1 diabetes\
  \ (HbA1c 64.5 \xB1 15.7\_mmol/mol; 8.0 \xB1 1.4%) and in 21 healthy individuals\
  \ (18\u201340\_years of age). NO-related substrates/metabolites were also measured\
  \ in the blood along with other vasoactive compounds and oxidative stress markers;\
  \ measurements were taken at rest, at peak exercise and after 15\_min of recovery.\
  \ Demographic characteristics, body composition, smoking status and diet were comparable\
  \ in both groups. Results: Maximal oxygen uptake was impaired in individuals with\
  \ type 1 diabetes compared with in healthy participants (35.6 \xB1 7.7 vs 39.6 \xB1\
  \ 6.8\_ml\_min\u22121\_kg\u22121, p < 0.01) despite comparable levels of habitual\
  \ physical activity (moderate to vigorous physical activity by accelerometery, 234.9\
  \ \xB1 160.0 vs 280.1 \xB1 114.9\_min/week). Compared with non-diabetic participants,\
  \ individuals with type 1 diabetes also displayed a blunted exercise-induced vasoreactivity\
  \ (muscle blood volume at peak exercise as reflected by \u2206 total haemoglobin,\
  \ 2.03 \xB1 5.82 vs 5.33 \xB1 5.54\_$\u03BC$mol/l; interaction \u2018exercise' \xD7\
  \ \u2018group', p < 0.05); this was accompanied by lower K+ concentration (p < 0.05),\
  \ reduced plasma l-arginine (p < 0.05)\u2014in particular when HbA1c was high (mean\
  \ estimation: \u22124.0, p < 0.05)\u2014and lower plasma urate levels (p < 0.01).\
  \ Nonetheless, exhaustive exercise did not worsen lipid peroxidation or other oxidative\
  \ stress biomarkers, and erythrocytic enzymatic antioxidant resources were mobilised\
  \ to a comparable extent in both groups. Nitrite and total nitrosation products,\
  \ which are potential alternative NO sources, were similarly unaltered. [Figure\
  \ not available: see fulltext.] Conclusions/interpretation: Participants with uncomplicated\
  \ type 1 diabetes displayed reduced availability of l-arginine, the essential substrate\
  \ for enzymatic nitric oxide synthesis, as well as lower levels of the major plasma\
  \ antioxidant, urate. Lower urate levels may reflect a defect in the activity of\
  \ xanthine oxidase, an enzyme capable of producing NO from nitrite under hypoxic\
  \ conditions. Thus, both canonical and non-canonical NO production may be reduced.\
  \ However, neither of these changes exacerbated exercise-induced oxidative stress.\
