abstract: 'Abstract  Background Cerebral autoregulation (CAR) systems maintain blood
  flow to the brain across a wide range of blood pressures. Deficits in CAR have been
  linked to gait speed (GS) but previous studies had small sample sizes and used specialized
  equipment which impede clinical translation. The purpose of this work was to assess
  the association between GS and orthostatic cerebral oxygenation in a large, community-dwelling
  sample of older adults.   Method Data for this study came from the Irish Longitudinal
  Study on Ageing. A near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) device attached to the forehead
  of each participant (n = 2 708) was used to track tissue saturation index (TSI;
  the ratio of oxygenated to total hemoglobin) during standing. GS was assessed using
  a portable walkway.   Results Recovery was impaired in slower GS participants with
  a TSI value at 20 seconds (after standing) of −0.55% (95% CI: −0.67, −0.42) below
  baseline in the slowest GS quartile versus −0.14% (95% CI: −0.25, −0.04) in the
  fastest quartile. Slower GS predicted a lower TSI throughout the 3-minute monitoring
  period. Results were not substantially altered by adjusting for orthostatic hypotension.
  Adjustment for clinical and demographic covariates attenuated the association between
  but differences remained between GS quartiles from 20 seconds to 3 minutes after
  standing.   Conclusion This study reported evidence for impaired recovery of orthostatic
  cerebral oxygenation depending on GS in community-dwelling older adults. Future
  work assessing NIRS as a clinical tool for monitoring the relationship between GS
  and cerebral regulation is warranted.'
