abstract: The emotional and cognitive cerebellum has been explored by several studies
  in the past years. Recent evidence suggested the possible contribution of the cerebellum
  in processing emotional prosody, namely the ability to comprehend the emotional
  content of a given vocal utterance, likely mediated by anatomical and functional
  cerebello-prefrontal connections. In the present study, the involvement of a functional
  cerebello-prefrontal network in recognising emotional prosody was assessed by combining
  non-invasive anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the right
  or the left cerebellum and functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy of the prefrontal
  cortex, in a double-blind within-subject experimental design on healthy participants.
  The results showed that right and, to a less extent, left cerebellar tDCS (as compared
  to sham stimulation) reduced neural activation in the prefrontal cortex while accuracy
  and reaction times at the vocal recognition task remained unchanged. These findings
  highlight functional properties of the cerebello-frontal connections and the psychophysiological
  effects of cerebellar brain stimulation, with possible clinical applications in
  psychiatric and neurological conditions.
