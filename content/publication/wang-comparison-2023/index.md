abstract: Obesity has negative impacts on cardiovascular function and may increase
  cerebrovascular complications during exercise. We compared hemodynamic and cerebral
  oxygen changes during high-intensity exercise between overweight (OW) and normal-weight
  (NW) individuals. Eighteen NW and fourteen OW male individuals performed high-intensity
  (70% of peak oxygen uptake, VO2peak) cycling exercises for 30 min. Hemodynamics
  were measured using a bioelectrical impedance device, and cerebral oxygenation status
  was measured using a near-infrared spectrophotometer during and after exercise.
  The VO2peak of NW individuals was significantly higher than that of OW individuals
  (41.3 ± 5.7 vs. 30.0 ± 5.0 mL/min/kg, respectively; p textless 0.05). During the
  30 min exercise, both groups exhibited an increase in oxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb)
  (p textless 0.001), deoxygenated hemoglobin (p textless 0.001), and cardiac output
  with increasing time. Post-exercise, cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance
  were significantly higher in the OW group than in the NW group (p textless 0.05).
  The O2Hb in the NW group was significantly higher at post-exercise times of 20 min
  (13.9 ± 7.0 μmol/L) and 30 min (12.3 ± 8.7 μmol/L) than that in the OW group (1.0
  ± 13.1 μmol/L and 0.6 ± 10.0 μmol/L, respectively; p = 0.024 vs. 0.023, respectively).
  OW participants demonstrated lower cerebral oxygenation and higher vascular resistance
  in the post-exercise phase than non-OW subjects. These physiological responses should
  be considered while engaging OW and obese individuals in vigorous exercise.
