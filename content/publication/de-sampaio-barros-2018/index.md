abstract: The present study attempts to better identify the neurophysiological changes
  occurring during flow experience and how this can be related to the mobilization
  of attentional resources. Self-reports of flow (using a flow feelings scale) and
  attention (using thought probes), autonomic activity (heart rate, heart rate variability,
  and breathing rate), and cerebral oxygenation (using near-infrared spectroscopy)
  in two regions of the frontoparietal attention network (right lateral frontal cortex
  and right inferior parietal lobe) were measured during the practice of two simple
  video games (Tetris and Pong) played at different difficulty conditions (easy, optimal,
  hard, or self-selected). Our results indicated that an optimal level of difficulty,
  compared with an easy or hard level of difficulty led to greater flow feelings and
  a higher concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin in the regions of the frontoparietal
  network. The self-selected, named autonomy condition did not lead to more flow feelings
  than the optimal condition; however, the autonomy condition led to greater sympathetic
  activity (reduced heart rate variability and greater breathing rate) and higher
  activation of the frontoparietal regions. Our study suggests that flow feelings
  are highly connected to the mobilization of attentional resources, and all the more
  in a condition that promotes individuals' choice and autonomy.
