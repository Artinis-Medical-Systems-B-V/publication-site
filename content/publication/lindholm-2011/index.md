abstract: "The aim of this study was to examine thermal and local blood flow responses\
  \ in the head area of the preadolescent boys during exposure to radiofrequency (RF)\
  \ electromagnetic fields produced by a GSM mobile phone. The design was a double-blinded\
  \ sham-controlled study of 26 boys, aged 14-15 years. The SAR distribution was calculated\
  \ and modelled in detail. The duration of the sham periods and exposures with GSM\
  \ 900 phone was 15 min each, and the tests were carried out in a climatic chamber\
  \ in controlled thermoneutral conditions. The ear canal temperatures were registered\
  \ from both ear canals, and the skin temperatures at several sites of the head,\
  \ trunk and extremities. The local cerebral blood flow was monitored by a near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy (NIRS), and the autonomic nervous system function by recordings of\
  \ ECG and continuous blood pressure. During the short-term RF exposure, local cerebral\
  \ blood flow did not change, the ear canal temperature did not increase significantly\
  \ and autonomic nervous system was not interfered. The strengths of this study were\
  \ the age of the population, multifactorial physiological monitoring and strictly\
  \ controlled thermal environment. The limitations of the study were large inter-individual\
  \ variation in the physiological responses, and short duration of the exposure.\
  \ Longer provocation protocols, however, might cause in children distress related\
  \ confounding physiological responses. \xA9 2011 Elsevier Ltd."
