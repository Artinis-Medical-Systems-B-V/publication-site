abstract: "This study was designed to determine whether trunk extensor fatigue occurs\
  \ during low-level activity and whether this is associated with a drop in muscle\
  \ tissue oxygenation. Electromyography (EMG) feedback was used to impose constant\
  \ activity in a part of the trunk extensor muscles. We hypothesized that electromyographic\
  \ manifestations of fatigue and decreased oxygenation would be observed at the feedback\
  \ site and that EMG activity at other sites would be more variable without fatigue\
  \ manifestations. Twelve volunteers performed 30-min contractions at 2% and 5% of\
  \ the maximum EMG amplitude (EMGmax) at the feedback site. EMG was recorded from\
  \ six sites over the lumbar extensor muscles and near-infrared spectroscopy was\
  \ used to measure changes in oxygenation at the feedback site (left L3 level, 3\
  \ cm paravertebral). In both conditions, mean EMG activity was not significantly\
  \ different between electrode sites, whereas the coefficient of variation was lower\
  \ at the feedback site compared to other recording sites. The EMG mean power frequency\
  \ (MPF) decreased consistently at the feedback site only. At 5% EMGmax, the decrease\
  \ in MPF was significant at the group level at all sites ipsilateral to the feedback\
  \ site. These results suggest that the limited variability of muscle activity at\
  \ the EMG feedback site and at ipsilateral locations enhances fatigue development.\
  \ No decreases in tissue oxygenation were detected. In conclusion, even at mean\
  \ activity levels as low as 2% EMGmax, fatigue manifestations were found in the\
  \ trunk extensors. These occured in absence of changes in oxygenation of the muscle\
  \ tissue. \xA9 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
