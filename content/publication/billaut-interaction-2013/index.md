abstract: "Purpose:To investigate the interaction between the development of peripheral\
  \ locomotor muscle fatigue, muscle recruitment and performance during repeated-sprint\
  \ exercise (RSE).Method:In a single-blind, randomised and cross-over design, ten\
  \ male team-sport athletes performed two RSE (fifteen 5-s cycling sprints interspersed\
  \ with 25 s of rest; power self-selected) in normoxia and in acute moderate hypoxia\
  \ (FIO2 0.138). Mechanical work, total electromyographic intensity (summed quadriceps\
  \ electromyograms, RMSsum) and muscle (vastus lateralis) and pre-fontal cortex near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy (NIRS) parameters were calculated for every sprint. Blood lactate\
  \ concentration ([Lac-]) was measured throughout the protocol. Peripheral quadriceps\
  \ fatigue was assessed via changes in potentiated quadriceps twitch force ($\u0394\
  $Qtw,pot) pre- versus post-exercise in response to supra-maximal magnetic femoral\
  \ nerve stimulation. The central activation ratio (QCAR) was used to quantify completeness\
  \ of quadriceps activation.Results:Compared with normoxia, hypoxia reduced arterial\
  \ oxygen saturation (-13.7%, P=0.001), quadriceps RMSsum (-13.7%, P=0.022), QCAR\
  \ (-3.3%, P=0.041) and total mechanical work (-8.3%, P=0.019). However, the magnitude\
  \ of quadriceps fatigue induced by RSE was similar in the two conditions ($\u0394\
  $Qtw,pot: -53.5% and -55.1%, P=0.71). The lower cycling performance in hypoxia occurred\
  \ despite similar metabolic (muscle NIRS parameters and blood [Lac-]) and functional\
  \ (twitch and M-wave) muscle states.Conclusion:Results suggest that the central\
  \ nervous system regulates quadriceps muscle recruitment and, thereby, performance\
  \ to limit the development of muscle fatigue during intermittent, short sprints.\
  \ This finding highlights the complex interaction between muscular perturbations\
  \ and neural adjustments during sprint exercise, and further supports the presence\
  \ of pacing during intermittent sprint exercise. \xA9 2013 Billaut et al."
