abstract: Purpose Cognitive training in parallel with functional near-infrared spectroscopy
  (fNIRS)-derived neurofeedback has been identified to be beneficial in enhancing
  cognitive function in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, effects
  of virtual reality (VR)-based cognitive training ensuring ecological validity in
  parallel with fNIRS-derived neurofeedback on neural efficiency has received little
  attention. This study investigated effects of VR-based cognitive training in parallel
  with fNIRS-derived neurofeedback on cognitive function and neural efficiency in
  patients with MCI. Method Ninety participants were randomly assigned into the active
  group (AG) receiving VR-based cognitive training in parallel with fNIRS-derived
  neurofeedback, the sham group (SG), or wait-list group (CG). The AG and SG group
  performed each intervention for fifteen minutes a session, for eight sessions. The
  Trail Making Test Part B and Backward Digit Span Test were used for outcomes. In
  addition, activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during cognitive
  testing using fNIRS was measured. Results After the eight sessions, the AG achieved
  greater improvements in all outcomes than the other groups. In addition, the AG
  showed a lower DLPFC activity during cognitive testing than the other groups. Conclusions
  VR-based cognitive training in parallel with fNIRS-derived neurofeedback is superior
  to enhancing cognitive function and neural efficiency.
