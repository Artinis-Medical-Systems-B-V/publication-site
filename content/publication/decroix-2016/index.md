abstract: "Acute exercise-induced improvements in cognitive function are accompanied\
  \ by increased (cerebral) blood flow and increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor\
  \ (BDNF) levels. Acute cocoa flavanol (CF) intake may improve cognitive function,\
  \ cerebral blood flow (in humans), and BNDF levels (in animals). This study investigated\
  \ (i) the effect of CF intake in combination with exercise on cognitive function\
  \ and (ii) cerebral hemodynamics and BDNF in response to CF intake and exercise.\
  \ Twelve healthy men participated in this randomized, double-blind, crossover study.\
  \ Participants performed a cognitive task (CT) at 100 min after acute 903-mg CF\
  \ or placebo (PL) intake, followed by a 30-min time-trial. Immediately after this\
  \ exercise, the same CT was performed. Prefrontal near-infrared spectroscopy was\
  \ applied during CT and exercise to measure changes in oxygenated ($\u0394$HbO2),\
  \ deoxygenated ($\u0394$HHb), and total haemoglobin ($\u0394$Hbtot) and blood samples\
  \ were drawn and analyzed for BDNF. Reaction time was faster postexercise, but was\
  \ not influenced by CF. $\u0394$HbO2 during the resting CT was increased by CF,\
  \ compared with PL. $\u0394$HbO2, $\u0394$HHb, and $\u0394$Hbtot increased in response\
  \ to exercise without any effect of CF. During the postexercise cognitive task,\
  \ there were no hemodynamic differences between CF or PL. Serum BDNF was increased\
  \ by exercise, but was not influenced by CF. In conclusion, at rest, CF intake increased\
  \ cerebral oxygenation, but not BDNF concentrations, and no impact on executive\
  \ function was detected. This beneficial effect of CF on cerebral oxygenation at\
  \ rest was overruled by the strong exercise-induced increases in cerebral perfusion\
  \ and oxygenation."
