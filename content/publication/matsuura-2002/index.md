abstract: Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive opticalmethod for continuous
  monitoring of oxygen consumptionand hemodynamics in tissue (eg, muscle tissue).
  Bank andChance1were the first to use NIRS for the investigation ofmetabolic myopathies.
  They found specific abnormalities ina variety of metabolic myopathies, indicating
  abnormal oxy-gen utilization. Several other investigators followed, includ-ing our
  group,2and reported similar abnormalities in mito-chondrial myopathies as compared
  with normal muscle.However, NIRS is still a relatively new technique, andmethodological
  constraints have not yet been fully exploited.We have investigated several methodological
  aspects of invivo NIRS measurements, and one of these concerned theinfluence of
  adipose tissue thickness (ATT) on in vivo NIRSmeasurements.
