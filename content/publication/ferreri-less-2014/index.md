abstract: "Several neuroimaging studies of cognitive aging revealed deficits in episodic\
  \ memory abilities as a result of prefrontal cortex (PFC) limitations. Improving\
  \ episodic memory performance despite PFC deficits is thus a critical issue in aging\
  \ research. Listening to music stimulates cognitive performance in several non-purely\
  \ musical activities (e.g., language and memory). Thus, music could represent a\
  \ rich and helpful source during verbal encoding and therefore help subsequent retrieval.\
  \ Furthermore, such benefit could be reflected in less demand of PFC, which is known\
  \ to be crucial for encoding processes. This study aimed to investigate whether\
  \ music may improve episodic memory in older adults while decreasing the PFC activity.\
  \ Sixteen healthy older adults ($\u03BC$ = 64.5 years) encoded lists of words presented\
  \ with or without a musical background while their dorsolateral prefrontal cortex\
  \ (DLPFC) activity was monitored using a eight-channel continuous-wave near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy (NIRS) system (Oxymon Mk III, Artinis, The Netherlands). Behavioral\
  \ results indicated a better source-memory performance for words encoded with music\
  \ compared to words encoded with silence (p < 0.05). Functional NIRS data revealed\
  \ bilateral decrease of oxyhemoglobin values in the music encoding condition compared\
  \ to the silence condition (p < 0.05), suggesting that music modulates the activity\
  \ of the DLPFC during encoding in a less-demanding direction.Taken together, our\
  \ results indicate that music can help older adults in memory performances by decreasing\
  \ their PFC activity.These findings open new perspectives about music as tool for\
  \ episodic memory rehabilitation on special populations with memory deficits due\
  \ to frontal lobe damage such as Alzheimer's patients. \xA9 2014 Ferreri, Bigand,\
