abstract: 'Background Multimodal rehabilitation has shown good results in adults with
  temporomandibular disorder (TMD), but there is still doubt regarding the protocolâ€™s
  ideal format (face-to-face or online), and its effectiveness among adolescents.
  The purpose of this study is to describe a randomized clinical trial protocol of
  face-to-face and online multimodal rehabilitation, in adolescents with TMD, and
  to determine its effects on pain, peripheral oxygenation of the masseter muscle,
  and mandibular range of motion, kinesiophobia and parafunction.  Methods A randomized,
  controlled clinical trial, blinded to statistical analyses, will be carried out,
  involving 26 adolescents, diagnosed with TMD. After randomization, the participants
  will be allocated into two groups: (1) telerehabilitation and (2) face-to-face treatment
  groups. Each group will undergo an initial assessment, followed by three treatment
  sessions, reassessment, and follow-up. Appointments and reassessments will be face-to-face,
  with instruments validated and adapted for adolescent age groups. The intervention
  protocol also aims at practicality, ease of execution, and strategies for the patient
  to easily self-manage and perform independently, adapted for face-to-face or online
  formats. The Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders, physical and psychosocial
  aspects, algometry, near-infrared spectroscopy, and the Tampa scale for kinesiophobia
  will be used to assess the outcomes.  Discussion It is expected that this study
  will contribute to online and face-to-face assessments and demonstrate the differences
  in the practice of rehabilitation of adolescents with TMD. Data will be published
  after the study is completed, and if the benefits are proven, care modalities may
  be implemented.'
