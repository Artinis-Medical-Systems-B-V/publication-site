abstract: "Abnormal levels of pyruvate and lactate were reported in multiple sclerosis\
  \ (MS). We studied the response of markers of mitochondrial function to rehabilitation\
  \ in relation to type, intensity and endurance performance in severely disabled\
  \ MS patients. Forty-six progressive MS patients were randomized to receive 12 walking\
  \ sessions of robot-assisted gait training (RAGT, n = 23) or conventional overground\
  \ therapy (CT, n = 23). Ten healthy subjects were also studied. Blood samples were\
  \ collected to determine lactate, pyruvate, and glutathione levels and lactate/pyruvate\
  \ ratio pre\u2013post rehabilitation. In vivo muscle metabolism and endurance walking\
  \ capacity were assessed by resting muscle oxygen consumption (rmVO2) using near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy and by six-minute walking distance (6MWD), respectively. The levels\
  \ of mitochondrial biomarkers and rmVO2, altered at baseline with respect to healthy\
  \ subjects, improved after rehabilitation in the whole population. In the two groups,\
  \ an enhanced response was observed after RAGT compared to CT for lactate (p = 0.012),\
  \ glutathione (<0.001), lactate/pyruvate ratio (p = 0.08) and rmVO2 (p = 0.07).\
  \ Metabolic biomarkers and 6MWD improvements were exclusively correlated with a\
  \ training speed markedly below individual gait speed. In severely disabled MS patients,\
  \ rehabilitation rebalanced altered serum metabolic and muscle parameters, with\
  \ RAGT being more effective than CT. A determinable slow training speed was associated\
  \ with better metabolic and functional recovery. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov\
  \ NCT02421731."
