abstract: 'Information retrieval (IR) relies on a general notion of relevance, which
  is used as the principal foundation for ranking and evaluation methods. However,
  IR does not account for more a nuanced affective experience. Here, we consider the
  emotional response decoded directly from the human brain as an alternative dimension
  of relevance. We report an experiment covering seven different scenarios in which
  we measure and predict how users emotionally respond to visual image contents by
  using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging on two commonly
  used affective dimensions: valence (negativity and positivity) and arousal (boredness
  and excitedness). Our results show that affective states can be successfully decoded
  using fNIRS, and utilized to complement the present notion of relevance in IR studies.
  For example, we achieved 0.39 Balanced accuracy and 0.61 AUC in 4-class classification
  of affective states (vs. 0.25 Balanced accuracy and 0.5 AUC of a random classifier).
  Likewise, we achieved 0.684 Precision@20 when retrieving high-arousal images. Our
  work opens new avenues for incorporating emotional states in IR evaluation, affective
  feedback, and information filtering.'
