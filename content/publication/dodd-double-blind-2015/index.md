abstract: 'Abstract Rationale: Evidence suggests interactive effects of the tea components
  caffeine and L-theanine on behaviour, yet no data exists exploring the impact of
  the two on cerebral blood flow (CBF). Objectives: The current placebo-controlled,
  double-blind, counterbalanced, crossover study examined the effects of caffeine
  and L-theanine on CBF and extended previous cognitive and mood findings by using
  lower doses than previous studies of a similar methodology, which more closely reflect
  the ratios present in tea. Methods: Twelve habitual consumers and 12 non-habitual
  consumers of caffeine each received 75 mg caffeine, 50 mg L-theanine, 75 mg caffeine
  plus 50 mg L-theanine, and placebo in a counterbalanced order across four separate
  visits. CBF was measured via near-infrared spectroscopy with cognition and mood
  assessed at baseline and 30 min post-dose. Salivary caffeine and peripheral haemodynamics
  were co-monitored. Results: Caffeine reduced oxygenated haemoglobin (oxy-Hb), increased
  deoxygenated haemoglobin (deoxy-Hb), improved performance on attention tasks and
  increased overall mood ratings. Increases in deoxy-Hb following caffeine were more
  pronounced in non-consumers. Some evidence for increased deoxy-Hb remained when
  caffeine was combined with L-theanine, but this effect was attenuated and the effects
  of caffeine on oxy-Hb, cognition and mood were eradicated. Conclusions: Combining
  L-theanine with caffeine, at levels and ratios equivalent to one to two cups of
  tea, eliminated the vasoconstrictive effect and behavioural effects of caffeine.
  This supports previous findings of an interaction between these substances, despite
  a lack of effects of L-theanine in isolation. However, at the levels tested here,
  this did not lead to a positive impact on behaviour.'
