abstract: Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is used for preventing muscle
  atrophy and improving muscle strength in patients and healthy people. However, the
  current intensity of NMES is usually set at a level that causes the stimulated muscles
  to contract. This typically causes pain. Quantifying the instantaneous changes in
  muscle microcirculation and metabolism during NMES before muscle contraction occurs
  is crucial, because it enables the current intensity to be optimally tuned, thereby
  reducing the NMES-induced muscle pain and fatigue. We applied near-infrared spectroscopy
  (NIRS) to measure instantaneous tissue oxygenation and deoxygenation changes in
  43 healthy young adults during NMES at 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 mA. Having been
  stabilized at the NIRS signal baseline, the tissue oxygenation and total hemoglobin
  concentration increased immediately after stimulation in a dose-dependent manner
  (P < 0.05) until stimulation was stopped at the level causing muscle contraction
  without pain. Tissue deoxygenation appeared relatively unchanged during NMES. We
  conclude that NIRS can be used to determine the optimal NMES current intensity by
  monitoring oxygenation changes.
