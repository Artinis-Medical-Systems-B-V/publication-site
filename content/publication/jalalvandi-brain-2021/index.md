abstract: "Background: fNIRS is a useful tool designed to record the changes in the density  of bloodâ€™s oxygenated hemoglobin (oxyHb) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxyHb)  molecules during brain activity. This method has made it possible to evaluate the he modynamic changes of the brain during neuronal activity in a completely non-aggres sive manner.  Objective: The present study has been designed to investigate and evaluate the  brain cortex activities during imagining of the execution of wrist motor tasks by  comparing fMRI and fNIRS imaging methods. Material and Methods: This novel observational Optical Imaging study aims  to investigate the brain motor cortex activity during imagining of the right wrist mo tor tasks in vertical and horizontal directions. To perform the study, ten healthy young  right-handed volunteers were asked to think about right-hand movements in different  directions according to the designed movement patterns. The required data were col lected in two wavelengths, including 845 and 763 nanometers using a 48 channeled  fNIRS machine.  Results: Analysis of the obtained data showed the brain activity patterns during  imagining of the execution of a movement are formed in various points of the motor  cortex in terms of location. Moreover, depending on the direction of the movement,  activity plans have distinguishable patterns. The results showed contralateral M1 was  mainly activated during imagining of the motor cortex (ptextless0.05). Conclusion: The results of our study showed that in brain imaging, it is possible  to distinguish between patterns of activities during wrist motion in different directions  using the recorded signals obtained through near-infrared Spectroscopy. The findings  of this study can be useful in further studies related to movement control and BCI"
