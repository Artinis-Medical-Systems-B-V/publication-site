abstract: This chapter delves into the critical role of oxygen metabolism in skeletal
  muscles during dynamic exercise, emphasizing the importance of efficient oxygen
  supply to sustain muscle activity, particularly during high-intensity efforts. The
  study employs Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS), a non-invasive technology, to measure
  concentration changes of oxygenated, deoxygenated, and total hemoglobin in muscle
  tissues. This approach provides valuable insights into the oxygen supply-demand
  balance under varying exercise intensities. The research focuses on the medial gastrocnemius
  muscles of healthy subjects, using NIRS to record oxygen metabolism changes during
  short-duration, high-intensity exercises. The findings reveal significant differences
  in oxygen utilization between the first and second exercise sessions, highlighting
  the impact of post-exercise effects on muscle oxygen metabolism. The study also
  categorizes oxygen metabolism characteristics into increased, stable, and decreased
  total hemoglobin trends, with the majority of participants exhibiting an increase
  in blood flow during the second exercise. This chapter offers a comprehensive analysis
  of NIRS data, discussing the implications for monitoring peripheral arterial occlusion
  disease and the importance of careful measurement site selection and muscle preparation
  for accurate assessments. The detailed methodology and insightful discussions make
  this a compelling read for those interested in the intricacies of muscle oxygen
  dynamics and the application of NIRS technology in exercise physiology.
