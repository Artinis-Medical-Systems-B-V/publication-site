abstract: "We assessed the effects of a 3-min partial-body cryostimulation (PBC) exposure\u2014\
  where the whole body is exposed to extreme cold, except the head\u2014on cognitive\
  \ inhibition performance and the possible implications of parasympathetic cardiac\
  \ control and cerebral oxygenation. In a randomized controlled counterbalanced cross-over\
  \ design, eighteen healthy young adults (nine males and nine females) completed\
  \ a cognitive Stroop task before and after one single session of PBC (3-min exposure\
  \ at \u2212 150 \xB0C cold air) and a control condition (3 min at room temperature,\
  \ 20 \xB0C). During the cognitive task, heart rate variability (HRV) and cerebral\
  \ oxygenation of the prefrontal cortex were measured using heart rate monitoring\
  \ and near-infrared spectroscopy methods. We also recorded the cerebral oxygenation\
  \ during the PBC session. Stroop performance after PBC exposure was enhanced (562.0\
  \ \xB1 40.2 ms) compared to pre-PBC (602.0 \xB1 56.4 ms; P < 0.042) in males only,\
  \ accompanied by an increase ( P < 0.05) in HRV indices of parasympathetic tone,\
  \ in greater proportion in males compared to females. During PBC, cerebral oxygenation\
  \ decreased in a similar proportion in males and females but the cerebral extraction\
  \ (deoxyhemoglobin: $\u0394$HHb) remained higher after exposure in males, only.\
  \ These data demonstrate that a single PBC session enhances the cognitive inhibition\
  \ performance on a Stroop task in males, partly mediated by a greater parasympathetic\
  \ cardiac control and greater cerebral oxygenation. The effects of PBC on cognitive\
  \ function seem different in females, possibly explained by a different sensitivity\
  \ to cold stimulation."
