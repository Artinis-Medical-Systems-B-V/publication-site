abstract: As differential physiological responses to hypoxic exercise between adults
  and children remain poorly understood, we aimed to comprehensively characterise
  cardiorespiratory and muscle oxygenation responses to submaximal and maximal exercise
  in normobaric hypoxia between the two groups. Following familiarisation, fifteen
  children (Age = 9 ± 1 years) and fifteen adults (Age = 22 ± 2 years) completed two
  graded cycling exercise sessions to exhaustion in a randomized and single-blind
  manner in normoxia (NOR; FiO2 = 20.9) and normobaric hypoxia (HYP; FiO2 = 13.0)
  exercises conditions. Age-specific workload increments were 25 W·3 min−1 for children
  and 40 W·3 min−1 for adults. Gas exchange and vastus lateralis oxygenation parameters
  were measured continuously via metabolic cart and near-infrared spectroscopy, respectively.
  Hypoxia provoked significant decreases in maximal power output PMAX (children =
  29%; adults 16% (F = 39.3; p textless 0.01)) and power output at the gas exchange
  threshold (children = 10%; adults:18% (F = 8.08; p = 0.01)) in both groups. Comparable
  changes were noted in most respiratory and gas exchange parameters at similar power
  outputs between groups. Children, however, demonstrated, lower PETCO2 throughout
  the test at similar power outputs and during the maintenance of V˙CO2 at the maximal
  power output. These data indicate that, while most cardiorespiratory responses to
  acute hypoxic exercise are comparable between children and adults, there exist age-related
  differential responses in select respiratory and muscle oxygenation parameters.
