abstract: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and its interaction with machine
  learning (ML) is a popular research topic for the diagnostic classification of clinical
  disorders due to the lack of robust and objective biomarkers. This review provides
  an overview of research on psychiatric diseases by using fNIRS and ML. Article search
  was carried out and 45 studies were evaluated by considering their sample sizes,
  used features, ML methodology, and reported accuracy. To our best knowledge, this
  is the first review that reports diagnostic ML applications using fNIRS. We found
  that there has been an increasing trend to perform ML applications on fNIRS-based
  biomarker research since 2010. The most studied populations are schizophrenia (n
  = 12), attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (n = 7), and autism spectrum
  disorder (n = 6) are the most studied populations. There is a significant negative
  correlation between sample size (textgreater21) and accuracy values. Support vector
  machine (SVM) and deep learning (DL) approaches were the most popular classifier
  approaches (SVM = 20) (DL = 10). Eight of these studies recruited a number of participants
  more than 100 for classification. Concentration changes in oxy-hemoglobin (ΔHbO)
  based features were used more than concentration changes in deoxy-hemoglobin (ΔHb)
  based ones and the most popular ΔHbO-based features were mean ΔHbO (n = 11) and
  ΔHbO-based functional connections (n = 11). Using ML on fNIRS data might be a promising
  approach to reveal specific biomarkers for diagnostic classification.
