abstract: "PURPOSE: Cardiovascular risk, predicted by peak O2 uptake (VO2peak), is\
  \ increased in type 1 diabetes. We examined the contribution of central and peripheral\
  \ mechanisms to VO2peak in physically active adults with type 1 diabetes. METHODS:\
  \ Seven men with type 1 diabetes and 10 healthy age-, anthropometry-, and physical\
  \ activity-matched men performed incremental cycling exercise until volitional fatigue.\
  \ Alveolar gas exchange (turbine and mass spectrometry), cardiac function and systemic\
  \ vascular resistance (impedance cardiography), and local active leg muscle deoxygenation\
  \ and blood flow (near infrared spectroscopy) were monitored. Arterial-venous O2\
  \ difference was calculated (Fick principle). Blood volume (BV) (carbon monoxide\
  \ rebreathing method) and glycemic control (glycosylated hemoglobin) were determined.\
  \ RESULTS: The group with diabetes had lower VO2peak than controls (47 \xB1 5 vs\
  \ 56 \xB1 7 mL\u02D9min\u02D9kg fat-free mass, P < 0.05). At peak exercise, fat-free\
  \ mass-adjusted stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO) were lower and systemic\
  \ vascular resistance was higher in the group with diabetes than those in controls\
  \ (P < 0.05). Leg muscle blood flow was reduced independently of CO in the group\
  \ with diabetes at peak exercise (P < 0.05), whereas arterial-venous O2 difference\
  \ was similar in the groups throughout the exercise (P > 0.05). The group with diabetes\
  \ had lower relative BV than controls (P < 0.01), and BV correlated positively with\
  \ peak SV and peak CO (P < 0.001). In the group with diabetes, peak SV and peak\
  \ CO correlated (P < 0.05) and peak leg muscle blood flow tended to correlate (P\
  \ = 0.070) inversely with glycosylated hemoglobin. CONCLUSIONS: Both central and\
  \ peripheral cardiovascular impairments limit VO2peak in physically active adults\
  \ with type 1 diabetes. Importantly, central limitations, and probably peripheral\
  \ limitations as well, are associated with glycemic control."
