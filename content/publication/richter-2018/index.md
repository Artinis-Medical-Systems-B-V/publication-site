abstract: "Purpose: To extend our knowledge of the functional linkages between visual\
  \ fatigue and regional cerebral prefrontal cortex (PFC) oxygenation, we measured\
  \ time related hemodynamic changes over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex\
  \ (dlPFC) during convergence load under conflicting stimulus-to-accommodation and\
  \ stimulus-to-vergence eye movements with and without concurrent mental load. Methods:\
  \ Twenty healthy participants with a median age of 28 years (range: 18\u201344 years)\
  \ fixated upon a vertical bar presented separately to the left and right eyes, using\
  \ polarized filters, during four counterbalanced 10-min periods: (i) no accommodation/vergence\
  \ conflict (Control, Ctrl); (ii) added convergence load and accommodation/vergence\
  \ conflict (Conv); (iii) added cognitive load only (Cog) and; (iv) a combination\
  \ of added cognitive and convergence load and accommodation/vergence conflict (Cc).\
  \ Viewing distance was 65 cm. Non-invasive measurements of hemodynamic activity\
  \ over the dlPFC were quantified by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).\
  \ During the two-convergence load conditions, the horizontal disparity of the two\
  \ bars varied dynamically from no disparity to a disparity set 20% below the individual\
  \ threshold for diplopia. Cognitive load was induced by the n-back-2 test which\
  \ required the subject to memorize and recall the changing colors of the horizontal\
  \ bars and decide when a given color was the same as that occurring two colors previously.\
  \ fNIRS data were averaged over 10-s windows centered at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 min\
  \ of each task, subtracted from a 20-s baseline window immediately preceding the\
  \ visual task, and then represented as changes in oxygenated hemoglobin ($\u0394\
  $HbO2), deoxygenated hemoglobin ($\u0394$HHb) and total hemoglobin ($\u0394$tHb).\
  \ Results: Linear mixed model analyses showed that hemodynamic activity was systematically\
  \ influenced by time (p < 0.001). The group-averaged time-related level of change\
  \ across the viewing conditions did not differ when compared with one another (p\
  \ > 0.05). Larger convergence eye-movement responses under conflicting stimulus-to-accommodation,\
  \ and stimulus-to-vergence over time, increased $\u0394$HbO2 and $\u0394$tHb only\
  \ in condition Cc and after 8 min of task time (p < 0.10 for min-6 and min-8: p\
  \ < 0.05 for min-10). Discussion: Collectively, our data suggest that HbO2, HHb,\
  \ and tHb, recorded over the dlPFC with fNIRS, can be used to assay the degree to\
  \ which supervisory oculomotor control processes are activated during visually deficient\
  \ near work."
