abstract: "Purpose: To characterize the relationships between muscle oxygenation and\
  \ performance during on- and off-water tests in highly trained sprint canoe\u2013\
  kayak athletes. Methods: A total of 30 athletes (19 kayakers and 11 canoeists) performed\
  \ a maximal incremental test on a canoe or kayak ergometer for determination of\
  \ VO2max and examination of the relation between peak power output (PPO) and physiological\
  \ parameters. A subset of 21 athletes also performed a 200- and a 500- (for women)\
  \ or 1000-m (for men) on-water time trial (TT). Near-infrared spectroscopy monitors\
  \ were placed on the latissimus dorsi, biceps brachii, and vastus lateralis during\
  \ all tests to assess changes in muscle O2 saturation (SmO2) and deoxyhemoglobin\
  \ concentration ([HHb]). The minimum O2 oxygenation (SmO2min) and maximal O2 ($\u0394\
  $[HHb] extraction) were calculated for all subjects. Results: PPO was most strongly\
  \ correlated with VO2max (R = .9), but there was also a large correlation between\
  \ PPO and both SmO2min and $\u0394$[HHb] in latissimus dorsi (R = \u2212.5, R =\
  \ .6) and vastus lateralis (R = \u2212.6, R = .6, all P < .05). Multiple regression\
  \ showed that 90% of the variance in 200-m performance was explained by both $\u0394\
  $[HHb] and SmO2min in the 3 muscles combined (P < .01) and 71% of the variance in\
  \ 500-/1000-m performance was explained by $\u0394$[HHb] in the 3 muscles (P < .01).\
  \ This suggests that O2 extraction is a better predictor of performance than VO2max\
  \ in sprint canoe\u2013kayak. Conclusions: These results highlight the importance\
  \ of peripheral adaptations in both short and long events and stress the relevance\
  \ of adding muscle oxygenation measurements during testing and racing in sprint\
  \ canoe\u2013kayak."
