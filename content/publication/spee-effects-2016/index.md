abstract: "Background High-intensity interval training (HIT) improves exercise capacity\
  \ in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). Moreover, HIT was associated with\
  \ improved resting cardiac function. However, the extent to which these improvements\
  \ actually contribute to training-induced changes in exercise capacity remains to\
  \ be elucidated. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of HIT on exercising central\
  \ haemodynamics and skeletal muscle oxygenation. Methods Twenty-six CHF patients\
  \ were randomised to a 12-week 4 \xD7 4 minute HIT program at 85-95% of peak VO2\
  \ or usual care. Patients performed maximal and submaximal cardiopulmonary exercise\
  \ testing with simultaneous assessment of cardiac output and skeletal muscle oxygenation\
  \ by near infrared spectroscopy, using the amplitude of the tissue saturation index\
  \ (TSIamp). Results Peak workload increased by 11% after HIT (p between group =\
  \ 0.01) with a non-significant increase in peak VO2 (+7%, p between group = 0.19).\
  \ Cardiac reserve increased by 37% after HIT (p within group = 0.03, p between group\
  \ = 0.08); this increase was not related to improvements in peak workload. Oxygen\
  \ uptake recovery kinetics after submaximal exercise were accelerated by 20% (p\
  \ between group = 0.02); this improvement was related to a decrease in TSIamp (r\
  \ = 0.71, p = 0.03), but not to changes in cardiac output kinetics. Conclusion HIT\
  \ induced improvements in maximal exercise capacity and exercising haemodynamics\
  \ at peak exercise. Improvements in recovery after submaximal exercise were associated\
  \ with attenuated skeletal muscle deoxygenation during submaximal exercise, but\
  \ not with changes in cardiac output kinetics, suggesting that the effect of HIT\
  \ on submaximal exercise capacity is mediated by improved microvascular oxygen delivery-to-utilisation\
  \ matching."
