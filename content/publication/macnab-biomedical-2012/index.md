abstract: "Progress in research applications of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)\
  \ and growing clinical interest have led to significant improvements in hardware\
  \ and software. Amongst continuous wave systems the use of light emitting diodes,\
  \ incorporation of spatially resolved optical geometry, algorithm refinement, development\
  \ of portable systems, and wireless telemetry led first to portable NIRS instruments,\
  \ then wearable systems, and now miniaturized self-contained devices. Measurement\
  \ of absolute tissue oxygen saturation in both muscle and brain, and mapping of\
  \ event related cortical hemodynamic responses using functional NIRS (fNIRS) have\
  \ added specific measurement modalities. Wireless wearable systems and self-contained\
  \ devices capable of measuring such modalities in addition to providing conventional\
  \ monitoring of trends in oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin concentration\
  \ from baseline have increased the scope of research, expanded the population readily\
  \ monitored, and opened new clinical avenues for applications involving NIRS. This\
  \ review explores the range of biomedical applications reported using wireless continuous\
  \ wave (CW) NIRS and fNIRS systems, summarizes key elements in the specification\
  \ of available devices, and outlines potential future directions for clinical use\
  \ of wireless NIRS technologies. \xA9 2012 - IOS Press and the authors."
