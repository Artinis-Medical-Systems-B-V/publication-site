abstract: Purpose This study aimed to investigate the long-term effects of multiple
  concussions on prefrontal cortex oxygenation during a neurovascular coupling activating
  task using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).  Methods Self-reported physically
  active males who previously participated in contact team sports at various levels
  of competition and who previously had experienced at least 3 concussions (n = 55;
  mTBI) or had no history of concussions (n = 29; CTRL) were recruited. Participants
  completed a 5 min “Where's Waldo” object identification protocol which consisted
  of participants closing their eyes for 20-s followed by 40-s (repeated 5 times over
  5-min) of searching a computer screen for “Waldo” hidden in a field of distractors.
  NIRS (μM) was used to measure right and left prefrontal cortex cerebral oxygenation.
  Oxygenated (O2Hb), deoxygenated (HHb), total (tHb) haemoglobin, and haemoglobin
  difference (HbDiff) were analysed through the change in average maximal and minimal
  values (ΔMAX), Z-scores, and standard deviations.  Results There were no significant
  differences in the relative change in cerebral oxygenation of the right prefrontal
  cortex between groups. In mTBI, left prefrontal cortex HHb ΔMAX (p = 0.031) and
  tHb ΔMAX (p = 0.044) were significantly lower than in the CTRL group. Within-group,
  right vs. left prefrontal cortex differences showed significantly lower values in
  left HbDiff Z-scores (p = 0.019) in only the mTBI group while the CTRL group showed
  significantly lower values in left HbDiff SD (p = 0.045).  Conclusion This preliminary
  study suggests that there are changes in prefrontal cortex oxygenation in males
  who had a history of experiencing multiple concussions in their past during a neurovascular
  coupling activating task. These changes may represent potential long-term effects
  in the brain's ability to adapt cerebral oxygenation during increased neural activity.
