abstract: Understanding the complex activation patterns of brain regions during motor
  tasks is crucial. Integrated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and functional
  near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) offers advanced insights into how brain activity
  fluctuates with motor activities. This study explores neuronal activation patterns
  in the cerebral cortex during active, passive, and imagined wrist movements using
  these functional imaging techniques. Data were collected from 10 right-handed volunteers
  performing a motor task using fMRI and fNIRS. fMRI utilized a 3T scanner and a 20-channel
  head coil, while fNIRS recorded data with a 48-channel device at 765 nm and 855
  nm. Analysis focused on key motor and sensory cortices using NIRS-SPM and SPM12,
  applying a significance threshold of p textless 0.05 and a minimum cluster size
  of 10 voxels for group analysis. Super-threshold voxels were identified with FWE
  thresholding in SPM12. For activation map extraction we focused on the primary motor
  cortex, primary somatosensory cortex, somatosensory association cortex, premotor
  cortex, and supplementary motor cortex. Both fMRI and fNIRS detected activation
  in the primary motor cortex (M1). The primary somatosensory cortex was found to
  influence movement direction coding, with smaller activation sizes for upward movements.
  Combining fNIRS with fMRI provided clearer differentiation of brain activation patterns
  for wrist movements in various directions and conditions (p textless 0.05). This
  study highlights variations in left motor cortex activity across different movement
  states. fNIRS proved effective in detecting brain function and showed strong correlation
  with fMRI results, suggesting it as a viable alternative for those unable to undergo
  fMRI.
