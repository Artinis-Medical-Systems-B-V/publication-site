 abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the effects of caffeine ingestion by chewing gum (GUMCAF) combined with priming exercise on pulmonary oxygen uptake (˙VO2) and near-infrared spectroscopy-derived muscle oxygen extraction (HHb + Mb) kinetics during cycling performed in a severe-intensity domain. Fifteen trained cyclists completed four visits: two under a placebo gum (GUMPLA) and two under GUMCAF ingestion. Each visit consisted of two square-wave cycling bouts at Δ70 intensity (70% of difference between the ˙VO2 at first ventilatory threshold and ˙VO2max) with duration of 6 min each and 5 min of passive rest between the bouts. The GUMPLA or GUMCAF (400 mg) was chewed for 5 min, 12 min before the first Δ70 bout in a randomized double-blind procedure. The fundamental phase and slow component of HHb + Mb and ˙VO2 kinetics were evaluated. For HHb + Mb kinetics, regardless of ingested gum, priming exercise effects occurred on the time constant (GUMCAF 16.0 ± 4.0 vs. 13.9 ± 2.9 s; GUMPLA 15.7 ± 6.1 vs. 13.2 ± 2.5 s), amplitude, slow component, time delay, and mean response time parameters (p ≤ .032). For ˙VO2 kinetics, there were significant effects of bouts on the amplitude, slow component, end ˙VO2, and the gain kinetics parameters (p \textless .017). Baseline ˙VO2 was higher during GUMCAF than GUMPLA (p = .020). No significant effects occurred for the interaction between gum and bout in any parameter of ˙VO2 or HHb + Mb kinetics. Therefore, unlike the priming exercise in severe-intensity exercise, GUMCAF is not an effective strategy for improving ˙VO2 or HHb + Mb kinetics acceleration.},
