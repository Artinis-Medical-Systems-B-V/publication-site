abstract: 'This study aimed to investigate the effects of caffeine ingestion by chewing
  gum (GUMCAF) combined with priming exercise on pulmonary oxygen uptake (˙VO2) and
  near-infrared spectroscopy-derived muscle oxygen extraction (HHb + Mb) kinetics
  during cycling performed in a severe-intensity domain. Fifteen trained cyclists
  completed four visits: two under a placebo gum (GUMPLA) and two under GUMCAF ingestion.
  Each visit consisted of two square-wave cycling bouts at Δ70 intensity (70% of difference
  between the ˙VO2 at first ventilatory threshold and ˙VO2max) with duration of 6
  min each and 5 min of passive rest between the bouts. The GUMPLA or GUMCAF (400
  mg) was chewed for 5 min, 12 min before the first Δ70 bout in a randomized double-blind
  procedure. The fundamental phase and slow component of HHb + Mb and ˙VO2 kinetics
  were evaluated. For HHb + Mb kinetics, regardless of ingested gum, priming exercise
  effects occurred on the time constant (GUMCAF 16.0 ± 4.0 vs. 13.9 ± 2.9 s; GUMPLA
  15.7 ± 6.1 vs. 13.2 ± 2.5 s), amplitude, slow component, time delay, and mean response
  time parameters (p ≤ .032). For ˙VO2 kinetics, there were significant effects of
  bouts on the amplitude, slow component, end ˙VO2, and the gain kinetics parameters
  (p textless .017). Baseline ˙VO2 was higher during GUMCAF than GUMPLA (p = .020).
  No significant effects occurred for the interaction between gum and bout in any
  parameter of ˙VO2 or HHb + Mb kinetics. Therefore, unlike the priming exercise in
  severe-intensity exercise, GUMCAF is not an effective strategy for improving ˙VO2
  or HHb + Mb kinetics acceleration.'
