abstract: "Assessing changes in brain activity under extreme conditions like weightlessness\
  \ is a desirable, but difficult undertaking. Results from previous studies report\
  \ specific changes in brain activity connected to an increase or decrease in gravity\
  \ forces. Nevertheless, so far it remains unclear (1) whether this is connected\
  \ to a redistribution of blood volume during micro- or hypergravity and (2) whether\
  \ this redistribution might account for neurocognitive alterations. This study aimed\
  \ to display changes in brain oxygenation caused by altered gravity conditions during\
  \ parabolic flight. It was hypothesized that an increase in gravity would be accompanied\
  \ by a decrease in brain oxygenation, whereas microgravity would lead to an increase\
  \ in brain oxygenation. Oxygenized and deoxygenized haemoglobin were measured using\
  \ two near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) probes on the left and right prefrontal\
  \ cortex throughout ten parabolas in nine subjects. Results show a decrease of 1.44\
  \ $\u03BC$mol/l in oxygenized haemoglobin with the onset of hypergravity, followed\
  \ by a considerable increase during microgravity (up to 5.34 $\u03BC$mol/l). In\
  \ contrast, deoxygenized haemoglobin was not altered during the first but only during\
  \ the second hypergravity phase and showed only minor changes during microgravity.\
  \ Changes in oxygenized and deoxygenized haemoglobin indicate an increase in arterial\
  \ flow to the brain and a decrease in venous outflow during microgravity. \xA9 2013\
