 abstract = {This study compared the O<inf>2</inf> delivery (a central determinant of VO<inf>2</inf>) and muscle deoxygenation (reflecting a peripheral determinant of VO<inf>2</inf>) during intense continuous, long-interval, and short-interval exercise protocols. Twelve young men completed the 3 protocols with equal overall effort. Simultaneous and continuous recordings of central hemodynamics, muscle oxygenation/deoxygenation and VO<inf>2</inf> were performed. Peak responses for stroke volume and peripheral resistance did not differ among protocols, whereas peak cardiac output and VO<inf>2</inf> were higher in long-interval vs. continuous and short-interval protocols with inactive rest phases (p<0.05). The average responses for all central parameters were higher in continuous and long-interval vs. short-interval exercise (p<0.05); average VO<inf>2</inf> and exercise-time above 80% VO<inf>2max</inf> were also higher in continuous and long-interval vs. short-interval protocol (p<0.05). Muscle de-oxygenation (↑$Δ$deoxyhemoglobin,↓$Δ$oxyhemoglobin, ↓muscle O<inf>2</inf>-saturation), as well as the mismatch of O<inf>2</inf> delivery and utilization ($Δ$deoxyhemoglobin/VO<inf>2</inf>) were remarkably alike among protocols. In conclusion, all 3 protocols resulted in a great activation of central and peripheral determinants of VO<inf>2</inf>. When performed with equal overall effort, the intense continuous and interval modalities reveal similarities in muscle O<inf>2</inf>-utilization response, but differences in central hemodynamic and VO<inf>2</inf> responses. Intense continuous and long-interval protocols exert a more commanding role on the cardiovascular system and VO<inf>2</inf> response compared to short-interval exercise with inactive rest phases.},
