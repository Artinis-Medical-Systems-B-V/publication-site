abstract: "This study compared the O<inf>2</inf> delivery (a central determinant of\
  \ VO<inf>2</inf>) and muscle deoxygenation (reflecting a peripheral determinant\
  \ of VO<inf>2</inf>) during intense continuous, long-interval, and short-interval\
  \ exercise protocols. Twelve young men completed the 3 protocols with equal overall\
  \ effort. Simultaneous and continuous recordings of central hemodynamics, muscle\
  \ oxygenation/deoxygenation and VO<inf>2</inf> were performed. Peak responses for\
  \ stroke volume and peripheral resistance did not differ among protocols, whereas\
  \ peak cardiac output and VO<inf>2</inf> were higher in long-interval vs. continuous\
  \ and short-interval protocols with inactive rest phases (p<0.05). The average responses\
  \ for all central parameters were higher in continuous and long-interval vs. short-interval\
  \ exercise (p<0.05); average VO<inf>2</inf> and exercise-time above 80% VO<inf>2max</inf>\
  \ were also higher in continuous and long-interval vs. short-interval protocol (p<0.05).\
  \ Muscle de-oxygenation (\u2191$\u0394$deoxyhemoglobin,\u2193$\u0394$oxyhemoglobin,\
  \ \u2193muscle O<inf>2</inf>-saturation), as well as the mismatch of O<inf>2</inf>\
  \ delivery and utilization ($\u0394$deoxyhemoglobin/VO<inf>2</inf>) were remarkably\
  \ alike among protocols. In conclusion, all 3 protocols resulted in a great activation\
  \ of central and peripheral determinants of VO<inf>2</inf>. When performed with\
  \ equal overall effort, the intense continuous and interval modalities reveal similarities\
  \ in muscle O<inf>2</inf>-utilization response, but differences in central hemodynamic\
  \ and VO<inf>2</inf> responses. Intense continuous and long-interval protocols exert\
  \ a more commanding role on the cardiovascular system and VO<inf>2</inf> response\
  \ compared to short-interval exercise with inactive rest phases."
