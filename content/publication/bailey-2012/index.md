abstract: "The present study examined to what extent professional boxing compromises\
  \ cerebral haemodynamic function and its association with CTBI (chronic traumatic\
  \ brain injury). A total of 12 male professional boxers were compared with 12 age-,\
  \ gender- and physical fitness-matched non-boxing controls. We assessed dCA (dynamic\
  \ cerebral autoregulation; thigh-cuff technique and transfer function analysis),\
  \ CVRCO2 (cerebrovascular reactivity to changes in CO2: 5% CO2 and controlled hyperventilation),\
  \ orthostatic tolerance (supine to standing) and neurocognitivefunction (psychometric\
  \ tests). Blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (transcranial Doppler\
  \ ultrasound),mean arterial blood pressure (finger photoplethysmography), end-tidal\
  \ CO2 (capnography) and corticaloxyhaemoglobin concentration (near-IR spectroscopy)\
  \ were continuously measured. Boxers were characterized byfronto-temporal neurocognitive\
  \ dysfunction and impaired dCA as indicated by a lower rate of regulation andautoregulatory\
  \ index (P<0.05 compared with controls). Likewise, CVRCO2 was also reduced resulting\
  \ in a lowerCVRCO2 range (P<0.05 compared with controls). The latter was most marked\
  \ in boxers with the highest CTBIscores and correlated against the volume and intensity\
  \ of sparring during training (r= -0.84, P<0.05). Theseimpairments coincided with\
  \ more marked orthostatic hypotension, cerebral hypoperfusion and corresponding\
  \ cortical de-oxygenation during orthostatic stress (P<0.05 compared with controls).\
  \ In conclusion, these findings provide the first comprehensive evidence for chronically\
  \ impaired cerebral haemodynamic function in active boxersdue to the mechanical\
  \ trauma incurred by repetitive, sub-concussive head impact incurred during sparring\
  \ training. This may help explain why CTBI is a progressive disease that manifests\
  \ beyond the active boxing career. \xA9 The Authors Journal compilation. \xA9 2013\
