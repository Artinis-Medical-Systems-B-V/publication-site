abstract: "Cirrhosis causes systemic and metabolic changes that culminate in various\
  \ complications, such as compromised pulmonary function, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy,\
  \ weight loss, and muscle weakness with significant physical function limitations.\
  \ Our aim is to evaluate the effects of training with neuromuscular electrical stimulation\
  \ (NMES) on the muscular and functional capacity of patients with cirrhosis classified\
  \ as Child-Pugh B and C. A total of 72 patients diagnosed with cirrhosis will be\
  \ recruited and randomized to perform an NMES protocol for 50 minutes, 3 times a\
  \ week, for 4 weeks. The evaluations will be performed at the beginning and after\
  \ 12 sessions, and patients will be submitted to a pulmonary function test, an ultrasound\
  \ evaluation of the rectus femoris, an evaluation of peripheral muscle strength,\
  \ a submaximal exercise capacity test associated with an evaluation of peripheral\
  \ tissue oxygenation, a quality of life evaluation, and orientation about monitoring\
  \ daily physical activities. The evaluators and patients will be blinded to the\
  \ allocation of the groups. Training Group will be treated with the following parameters:\
  \ frequency of 50 Hz, pulse width of 400 $\u03BC$s, rise and fall times of 2 s,\
  \ and on:off 1:1; Sham Group: 5 Hz, 100 $\u03BC$s, on:off 1:3. The data will be\
  \ analyzed using the principles of the intention to treat. This study provides health\
  \ professionals with information on the benefits of this intervention. In this way,\
  \ we believe that the results of this study could stimulate the use of NMES as a\
  \ way of rehabilitating patients with more severe cirrhosis, with the objective\
  \ of improving these patients' functional independence."
