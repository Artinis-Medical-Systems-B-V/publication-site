abstract: Audiovisual stimuli during exercise can improve affective and perceptual
  responses; however, the factors moderating this benefit as well as the associated
  cerebral haemodynamic responses remain largely unexplored. Accordingly, the present
  work investigated the moderating role of exercise intensity on affective, perceptual
  and haemodynamic responses to audiovisual stimuli. Fifty participants (Mage = 20.24
  ± 2.89 years, 45 females) were randomly assigned to either audiovisual stimuli group
  or control group. Both groups completed separate 20-min bouts of aerobic exercise
  at 10% below and 10% above participant-specific ventilatory threshold (VT). Functional
  near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to measure prefrontal cortex oxygenated
  haemoglobin (O2Hb), as marker of brain activity, during exercise. Affective valence,
  perceived activation, perceived exertion, and attentional focus were measured every
  5 min during exercise. Data were analysed using linear mixed models with Bonferroni
  adjustment for multiple comparisons. The intensity × time interaction for affective
  valence was statistically significant (p = .02). Post hoc tests showed exercise
  at 10% above VT induced less pleasure than 10% below VT at 15 min (b = −0.70, p
  = .01) and 20 min (b = −0.96, p textless .01). The time × hemisphere interaction
  for O2Hb was also significant (p textless .01). Post hoc tests indicated that greater
  PFC activity was observed in the right hemisphere than in the left hemisphere at
  5–10 min (b = 0.001, p textless .01) during exercise. Finally, the results showed
  significantly greater dissociation (i.e., external thoughts) in the audiovisual
  group compared to the control group (b = 15.42, p textless .01), The use of audiovisual
  stimuli during exercise represents a cost-effective intervention to shift the individual's
  attentional focus away from internal, typically unpleasant interoceptive sensations
  perceived at higher exercise intensities, to external thoughts. Exercise at an intensity
  below VT may be beneficial for physically inactive individuals who intend to exercise.
