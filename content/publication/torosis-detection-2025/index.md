abstract: High-tone pelvic floor dysfunction (HTPFD) is a neuromuscular disorder of
  the pelvic floor characterized by non-relaxing pelvic floor muscles, resulting in
  voiding and defecatory symptoms, sexual dysfunction, and pelvic pain. A challenge
  in the management of HTPFD has been a lack of quantitative measures of pelvic floor
  muscle physiology for accurate diagnosis. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a
  non-invasive diagnostic tool for real time measurement of physiologic muscle parameters.
  A vaginal probe incorporating a multipoint NIRS emitter/detector array was linked
  wirelessly to a four-wavelength continuous wave NIRS instrument. Concentration changes
  in O2Hb and HHb were recorded, and the difference between the two (HbDiff) was calculated
  for the right and left pelvic floor musculature over the course of five maximum
  voluntary contractions (MVCs) and one sustained maximum voluntary contraction (SMVC)
  of the PFM. Half-recovery time of hemoglobin difference, HbDiff(½RT), following
  sustained maximal voluntary contraction (SMVC), was calculated. It is a validated,
  NIRS-derived, oxygen kinetic parameter indicating muscle metabolic function. The
  aim was to evaluate if differences in HbDiff(½RT) could be detected in women with
  HTPFD compared to controls. Serial measures were recorded for 24 asymptomatic control
  and 5 women with HTPFD. In women with HTPFD there was an absence of desaturation
  as well as a failure to recover to pre-contraction oxygenation even after relaxation.
  Throughout the pelvic floor HbDiff(½RT) was prolonged in the HTPFD subjects, indicating
  worsened pelvic floor metabolic function. This confirmed that assessment of pelvic
  floor muscle dysfunction using NIRS monitoring is feasible for the detection of
  HTPFD.
