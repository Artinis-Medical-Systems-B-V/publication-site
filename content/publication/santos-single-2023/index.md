abstract: In the present study, it was evaluated whether microencapsulated cocoa supplementation
  could attenuate endothelial dysfunction caused by eccentric exercise in healthy
  subjects. Thirteen volunteers were enrolled in this double-blind, placebo-controlled,
  crossover study. Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), blood flow and muscle O2 saturation
  (StO2) were evaluated by ultrasound and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), respectively,
  before and after microencapsulated cocoa supplementation. The eccentric exercise
  was performed after microencapsulated cocoa supplementation to generate vascular
  dysfunction. Eccentric exercise significantly reduced FMD in the PLA condition,
  but cocoa attenuated this exercise effect. No significant effect was observed on
  muscle StO2 and blood flow after eccentric exercise and nutritional supplementation.
  In conclusion, the present study showed that a single dose of microencapsulated
  cocoa ingestion attenuated FMD-induced eccentric exercise. These findings suggest
  that a single dose of microencapsulated cocoa may be an alternative nutritional
  strategy to attenuate vascular dysfunction induced by eccentric exercise in healthy
  individuals.
