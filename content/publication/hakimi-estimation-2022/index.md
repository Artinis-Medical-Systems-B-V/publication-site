abstract: 'Objective: Respiration is recognized as a systematic physiological interference
  in functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). However, it remains unanswered
  as to whether it is possible to estimate the respiratory rate (RR) from such interference.
  Undoubtedly, RR estimation from fNIRS can provide complementary information that
  can be used alongside the cerebral activity analysis, e.g., sport studies. Thus,
  the objective of this paper is to propose a method for RR estimation from fNIRS.
  Our primary presumption is that changes in the baseline wander of oxygenated hemoglobin
  concentration (O2Hb) signal are related to RR. Methods: fNIRS and respiratory signals
  were concurrently collected from subjects during controlled breathing tasks at a
  constant rate from 0.1 Hz to 0.4 Hz. Firstly, the signal quality index algorithm
  is employed to select the best O2Hb signal, and then a band-pass filter with cut-off
  frequencies from 0.05 to 2 Hz is used to remove very low- and high-frequency artifacts.
  Secondly, troughs of the filtered O2Hb signal are localized for synthesizing the
  baseline wander (S1) using cubic spline interpolation. Finally, the fast Fourier
  transform of the S1 signal is computed, and its dominant frequency is considered
  as RR. In this paper, two different datasets were employed, where the first one
  was used for the parameter adjustment of the proposed method, and the second one
  was solely used for testing. Results: The low mean absolute error between the reference
  and estimated RRs for the first and second datasets (2.6 and 1.3 breaths per minute,
  respectively) indicates the feasibility of the proposed method for RR estimation
  from fNIRS. Significance: This paper provides a novel view on the respiration interference
  as a source of complementary information in fNIRS.'
