abstract: Neuromarketing research has emerged as an innovative method of collecting
  accurate consumer data for understanding consumer decisions and improving marketing
  efforts. Using neurophysiological measures with devices such as eye trackers, functional
  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), Electroencephalogram (EEG), heart rate variability
  (HRV), and galvanic skin response (GSR), researchers can collect sensitive measures
  of consumers' reactions to different stimuli and reveal hidden information about
  the consumer experience without having to ask the consumer directly. This information
  may be used by marketers to influence purchasing behavior and increase sales. In
  this paper, we use simultaneous measurements of EEG and functional near-infrared
  spectroscopy (fNIRS), combined with galvanic skin response (GSR) and heart rate
  variability (HRV) measurements, to investigate the effect of pricing on subjects'
  product preference.
