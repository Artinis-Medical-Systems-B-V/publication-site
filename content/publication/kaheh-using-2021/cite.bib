 abstract = {Neuromarketing research has emerged as an innovative method of collecting accurate consumer data for understanding consumer decisions and improving marketing efforts. Using neurophysiological measures with devices such as eye trackers, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), Electroencephalogram (EEG), heart rate variability (HRV), and galvanic skin response (GSR), researchers can collect sensitive measures of consumers' reactions to different stimuli and reveal hidden information about the consumer experience without having to ask the consumer directly. This information may be used by marketers to influence purchasing behavior and increase sales. In this paper, we use simultaneous measurements of EEG and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), combined with galvanic skin response (GSR) and heart rate variability (HRV) measurements, to investigate the effect of pricing on subjects' product preference.},
