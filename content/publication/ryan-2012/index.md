abstract: "Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a well-known method used to measure\
  \ muscle oxygenation and hemodynamics in vivo. The application of arterial occlusions\
  \ allows for the assessment of muscle oxygen consumption (mVO 2) using NIRS. The\
  \ aim of this study was to measure skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity using\
  \ blood volume-corrected NIRS signals that represent oxygenated hemoglobin/myoglobin\
  \ (O2Hb) and deoxygenated hemoglobin/myoglobin (HHb). We also assessed the reliability\
  \ and reproducibility of NIRS measurements of resting oxygen consumption and mitochondrial\
  \ capacity. Twenty-four subjects, including four with chronic spinal cord injury,\
  \ were tested using either the vastus lateralis or gastrocnemius muscles. Ten healthy,\
  \ ablebodied subjects were tested on two occasions within a period of 7 days to\
  \ assess the reliability and reproducibility. NIRS signals were corrected for blood\
  \ volume changes using three different methods. Resting oxygen consumption had a\
  \ mean coefficient of variation (CV) of 2.4% (range 1-32%). The recovery of oxygen\
  \ consumption (mVO2) after electrical stimulation at 4 Hz was fit to an exponential\
  \ curve, which represents mitochondrial capacity. The time constant for the recovery\
  \ of mVO2 was reproducible with a mean CV of 10% (range 1-22%) only when correcting\
  \ for blood volume changes. We also examined the effects of adipose tissue thickness\
  \ on measurements of mVO 2. We found the mVO2 measurements using absolute units\
  \ to be influenced by adipose tissue thickness (ATT), and this relationship was\
  \ removed when an ischemic calibration was performed, supporting its use to compare\
  \ mVO2 between individuals of varying ATT. In conclusion, in vivo oxidative capacity\
  \ can be assessed using blood volume-corrected NIRS signals with a high degree of\
  \ reliability and reproducibility. Copyright \xA9 2012 the American Physiological\
