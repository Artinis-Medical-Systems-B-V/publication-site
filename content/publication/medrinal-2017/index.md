abstract: "Introduction: Early rehabilitation has become widespread practice for patients\
  \ in intensive care; however, the prevalence of intensive care unit-acquired weakness\
  \ remains high and the majority of physiotherapy is carried out in bed. Several\
  \ inbed rehabilitation methods exist, but we hypothesise that techniques that provoke\
  \ muscle contractions are more effective than passive techniques. Methods: A randomised,\
  \ controlled cross-over study will be carried out to evaluate and compare the effectiveness\
  \ of early rehabilitation techniques on cardiac output (CO) in sedated patients\
  \ in intensive care. 20 intubated and sedated patients will undergo 4 10 min rehabilitation\
  \ sessions. 2 sessions will involve \u2018passive' techniques based on mobilisations\
  \ and inbed cycle ergometry and 2 involving electrostimulation of the quadriceps\
  \ muscle and Functional Electrical Stimulation-cycling (FES-cycling). The primary\
  \ outcome is CO measured by Doppler ultrasound. The secondary outcomes are right\
  \ ventricular function, pulmonary systolic arterial pressure, muscle oxygenation\
  \ and minute ventilation during exercise. Results and conclusion: Approval has been\
  \ granted by our Institutional Review Board (Comit\xE9 de Protection des Personnes\
  \ Nord-Ouest 3). The results of the trial will be presented at national and international\
  \ meetings and published in peer-reviewed journals."
