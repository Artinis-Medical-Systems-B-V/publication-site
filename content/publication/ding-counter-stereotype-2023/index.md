abstract: 'The generation and stock of construction and demolition (C&D) waste is
  increasing, which makes the environmental and economic problems serious. In recent
  years, China has also launched many policies to encourage and guide C&D waste recycling.
  However, most of these policies are aimed at contractors and recycling utilization
  parties, while the lack of publicity and promotion has led to the acceptance in
  the market is generally low. People may have a negative stereotype of this recycled
  material recycled from C&D waste.  In order to explore a measure that can alleviate
  this problem, this study used experimental research methods from psychology and
  neuroscience to investigate the mechanisms of different presentation forms of counter-stereotype
  intervention materials. This study included two experiments: the pretest experiment
  verified the implicit-explicit stereotype and neuronal image representation of C&D
  recycling products through single category implicit association test (SC-IAT), semantic
  difference scale and functional near-infrared (fNIRS). The posttest experiment was
  based on the counter-stereotype intervention method and intergroup contact theory.
  A within-participants design was used to investigate the effectiveness of counter-stereotype
  intervention and the differences in two intervene presentation forms based on the
  pretest experiment.  The results showed that the counter-stereotype intervention
  was effective in suppressing the activation of stereotypes. The effects of the intervention
  were similar for both the video and graphic formats. In the neuron imaging representation
  of the posttest experiment, the significantly activated brain region shifted from
  the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (R-dlPFC) to the left dorsolateral prefrontal
  cortex (L-dlPFC). L-dlPFC is highly associated with the modulation of cognition,
  indicating that after the counter-stereotype intervention, the necessity of C&D
  waste recycling and the credibility of the recycling product influenced the participants.
  So when the stereotype was reactivated, the signal in the L-dlPFC was suppressed,
  weakening the expression of the stereotype. This also suggests that the mechanism
  of counter-stereotype intervention is to strengthen the brain regulatory system
  rather than to inhibit the activation of stereotypes at the source.'
