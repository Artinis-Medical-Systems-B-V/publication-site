abstract: 'Background: Cognitive processes are required during walking to appropriately
  respond to environmental and task demands. There are now many studies that have
  used functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) to record brain activation to
  investigate neural bases of cognitive contributions in gait. The aim of this systematic
  review was to summarize the published research regarding Prefrontal cortical (PFC)
  activation patterns during simple and complex walking tasks in young adults, older
  adults and clinical groups with balance disorders using fNIRS. Our secondary aim
  was to evaluate each included study based on methodological reporting criteria important
  for good data quality. Methods: We conducted searches in June 2018 using four databases:
  Embase, PubMed, Scopus and PsycINFO. The strategy search used was: (((((near infrared
  spectroscopy) OR functional near infrared spectroscopy) OR nirs) OR fnirs) AND (((gait)
  OR walking) OR locomotion) AND (((((young) OR adult) OR older) OR elderly) NOT children))
  AND (((Brain) OR cortex) OR cortical) for our search. The papers included met the
  specific review criteria: (i) used fNIRS to measure PFC activation patterns; (ii)
  included walking tasks (simple and complex) and; (iii) assessed young people, older
  people and/or clinical groups with balance disorders. Results: Thirty five (describing
  75 brain activation comparisons) of the 308 studies retrieved through our search
  met the inclusion criteria. Based on 6 methodological reporting considerations,
  20 were of high quality, 10 were of medium quality and 5 were of low quality. Eleven/20
  comparisons in young people, 23/37 comparisons in older people and 15/18 comparisons
  in clinical groups reported increased PFC activation with increased walking task
  complexity. The majority of comparisons that used verbal fluency, counting backwards
  or secondary motor tasks reported increases in PFC activation (83%, 64% and 58%
  of these studies, respectively). In contrast, no studies found secondary visual
  tasks increased PFC activation. Conclusion: Increased PFC activation was most common
  in studies that involved walks comprising secondary verbal fluency and arithmetic
  tasks. Clinical groups generally showed increased PFC activation irrespective of
  type of secondary task performed during walking which suggests these groups require
  more attentional resources for safe walking. Systematic review registration number:
