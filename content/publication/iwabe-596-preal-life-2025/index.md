abstract: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a progressive neuromuscular disease characterized
  by muscle weakness and wasting due to motor neuron degeneration. It may present
  anywhere from birth up to adult life. Risdiplam is an oral splicing modifier of
  SMN2 which has been approved to treat these patients. Real-life data on Risdiplam
  beyond European and North American cohorts are scarce. To describe the real-life
  experience with Risdiplam in a Brazilian cohort of patients with SMA and mixed phenotypes.
  This is a prospective collection of data from all patients with SMA treated with
  Risdiplam at the University of Campinas (UNICAMP) since xx2023. All subjects on
  treatment for at least 11 months were included. Clinical efficacy was assessed using
  the CHOP-INTEND and/or HFMSE scales performed every 3 months after therapy was started.
  There were 20 patients (11 male and 9 female). Mean age was 23.7 years (ranging
  from 6 to 60 years). According to the phenotypes, there were 4 with SMA type 1,
  13 with SMA type 2 and 3 with SMA type 3. Clinical scores remained stable in 4 patients
  and improved in the remaining 16 patients. The extent of improvement varied from
  xx 11,11 to xx 33,33 %. None of the patients had motor function decline. Among those
  with stable scores, there were xx 04 with SMA type 2 and xx 01 with SMA type 3,
  whereas among those who improved, there were 4 with SMA type 1, 10 with SMA type
  2 and 2 with SMA type 3. Risdiplam was well tolerated in all patients. Even in this
  short-term follow-up, we were able to show that Risdiplam led to clinical improvements
  in most patients treated in this cohort.
