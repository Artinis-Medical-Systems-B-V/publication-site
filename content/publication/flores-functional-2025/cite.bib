 abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this case series was to explore the feasibility and impact of a 3-week activities-based locomotor training (AB-LT) program on functional activities and neurophysiological adaptations in 5 children with cerebral palsy (CP).
Methods: Children, aged 2-6 years who were classified as Gross Motor Function Classification Scale levels III or IV, participated in the intervention 5 days per week for 3 hours per day. The Gross Motor Function Measure-66 (GMFM-66) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy neuroimaging were performed pre- and post-intervention.
Results: After AB-LT, increases in GMFM-66 scores were observed for Children 1 (Δ3.3), 2 (Δ5.6), 4 (Δ1.8), and 5 (Δ1.3), beyond expected natural progression. A reduction in total hemoglobin activation and increased neural demand was observed. Child 3 had minimal functional changes with no observed neurophysiological adaptations.
Conclusions: The 3-week AB-LT regimen is a short duration, high-intensity program with the potential to benefit children with CP.},
