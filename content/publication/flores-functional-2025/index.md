abstract: 'Purpose: The purpose of this case series was to explore the feasibility
  and impact of a 3-week activities-based locomotor training (AB-LT) program on functional
  activities and neurophysiological adaptations in 5 children with cerebral palsy
  (CP). Methods: Children, aged 2-6 years who were classified as Gross Motor Function
  Classification Scale levels III or IV, participated in the intervention 5 days per
  week for 3 hours per day. The Gross Motor Function Measure-66 (GMFM-66) and functional
  near-infrared spectroscopy neuroimaging were performed pre- and post-intervention.
  Results: After AB-LT, increases in GMFM-66 scores were observed for Children 1 (Δ3.3),
  2 (Δ5.6), 4 (Δ1.8), and 5 (Δ1.3), beyond expected natural progression. A reduction
  in total hemoglobin activation and increased neural demand was observed. Child 3
  had minimal functional changes with no observed neurophysiological adaptations.
  Conclusions: The 3-week AB-LT regimen is a short duration, high-intensity program
  with the potential to benefit children with CP.'
