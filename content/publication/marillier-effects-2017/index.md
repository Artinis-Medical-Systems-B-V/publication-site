abstract: "Purpose: While acute hypoxic exposure enhances exercise-induced central\
  \ fatigue and can alter corticospinal excitability and inhibition, the effect of\
  \ prolonged hypoxic exposure on these parameters remains to be clarified. We hypothesized\
  \ that 5\_days of altitude exposure would (i) normalize exercise-induced supraspinal\
  \ fatigue during isolated muscle exercise to sea level (SL) values and (ii) increase\
  \ corticospinal excitability and inhibition. Methods: Eleven male subjects performed\
  \ intermittent isometric elbow flexions at 50% of maximal voluntary contraction\
  \ to task failure at SL and after 1 (D1) and 5 (D5)\_days at 4350\_m. Transcranial\
  \ magnetic stimulation and peripheral electrical stimulation were used to assess\
  \ supraspinal and peripheral fatigues. Pre-frontal cortex and biceps brachii oxygenation\
  \ was monitored by near-infrared spectroscopy. Results: Exercise duration was not\
  \ statistically different between SL (1095\_\xB1\_562\_s), D1 (1132\_\xB1\_516\_\
  s), and D5 (1440\_\xB1\_689\_s). No significant differences were found between the\
  \ three experimental conditions in maximal voluntary activation declines at task\
  \ failure (SL \u221216.8\_\xB1\_9.5%; D1 \u221225.5\_\xB1\_11.2%; D5 \u221221.8\_\
  \xB1\_7.0%; p\_>\_0.05). Exercise-induced peripheral fatigue was larger at D5 versus\
  \ SL (100\_Hz doublet at task failure: \u221258.8\_\xB1\_16.6 versus \u221241.8\_\
  \xB1\_20.1%; p\_<\_0.05). Corticospinal excitability at 50% maximal voluntary contraction\
  \ was lower at D5 versus SL (brachioradialis p\_<\_0.05, biceps brachii p\_=\_0.055).\
  \ Cortical silent periods were shorter at SL versus D1 and D5 (p\_<\_0.05). Conclusions:\
  \ The present results show similar patterns of supraspinal fatigue development during\
  \ isometric elbow flexions at SL and after 1 and 5\_days at high altitude, despite\
  \ larger amount of peripheral fatigue at D5, lowered corticospinal excitability\
  \ and enhanced corticospinal inhibition at altitude."
