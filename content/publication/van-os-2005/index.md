abstract: "Background: Sufficient O2 supply to the brain is necessary for adequate\
  \ cerebral energy metabolism, function and growth. Objectives: To elucidate the\
  \ relation between changes in cerebral arterial O2 content and cerebral O2 supply\
  \ and changes in the oxygenation state of cerebral hemoglobin, and to determine\
  \ whether concentration changes in oxyhemoglobin ($\u0394$cO2Hb), deoxyhemoglobin\
  \ ($\u0394$cHHb), and cerebral arterial oxygenation ($\u0394$cHbD; the difference\
  \ between $\u0394$cO2Hb and $\u0394$cHHb), and cerebral blood volume ($\u0394$CBV)\
  \ can be used to assess the decline in brain cell function during hypoxemia in lambs\
  \ born near term. Methods: 17 preterm lambs were delivered at a mean gestational\
  \ age of 133 days. Decreases in cerebral arterial oxygen content were induced by\
  \ a stepwise reduction in inspired oxygen concentration. Mean values of all continuous\
  \ variables were calculated over the last 180 s of each hypoxemic level. Cerebral\
  \ arterial blood gases were analyzed at the end of each level to calculate cerebral\
  \ arterial O2 content and cerebral O2 supply. Results: Changes in cerebral arterial\
  \ O2 content and cerebral O2 supply were positively linearly related with $\u0394\
  $cO 2Hb and $\u0394$cHbD, and negatively with $\u0394$cHHb and the concentration\
  \ changes in total hemoglobin. Electrocortical brain activity remained stable until\
  \ the cO2Hb and cHbD decreased to >3.0 \xB1 0.9and >8.1 \xB1 1.9 (mean \xB1 SD)\
  \ $\u03BC$mol/100 g, respectively, and cHHb and CBV increased to >4.3 \xB1 1.7 and\
  \ 1.37 \xB1 0.48 ml/100 g, respectively, as compared to baseline. Conclusions: Changes\
  \ in cerebral arterial O2 content and cerebral O2 supply are adequately reflected\
  \ by changes in the oxygenation state of cerebral hemoglobin. Concentration changes\
  \ in $\u0394$cO2Hb, $\u0394$cHHb, $\u0394$cHbD and $\u0394$CBV can be used to assess\
  \ the decline in brain cell function during hypoxemia in lambs born near term. Copyright\
