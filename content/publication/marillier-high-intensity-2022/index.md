abstract: 'eft/right prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation is linked to positive/negative
  affects, respectively. Besides, larger left PFC oxygenation during exercise relates
  to higher cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). High-intensity interval training (HIIT)
  is superior to moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) in improving CRF. The
  influence of training on PFC oxygenation and affects during exercise in individuals
  with obesity is, however, currently unknown. Twenty participants with obesity (14
  males, 48 ± 8 years, body-mass index = 35 ± 6 kg·m−2) were randomised to MICT [50%
  peak work rate (WRpeak)] or HIIT (1-min bouts 100% WRpeak; 3 sessions/week, 8 weeks).
  Before/after training, participants completed an incremental ergocycle test. Near-infrared
  spectroscopy and the Feeling Scale assessed PFC oxygenation and affects during exercise,
  respectively. Improvements in CRF (e.g., WRpeak: 32 ± 14 vs 20 ± 13 W) were greater
  after HIIT vs MICT (p textless 0.05). Only HIIT induced larger left PFC oxygenation
  (haemoglobin difference from 7 ± 6 to 10 ± 7 μmol) and enhanced affective valence
  (from 0.7 ± 2.9 to 2.2 ± 2.0; p textless 0.05) at intensities ≥ second ventilatory
  threshold. Exercise-training induced changes in left PFC oxygenation correlated
  with changes in CRF [e.g., WRpeak (% predicted), r = 0.46] and post-training affective
  valence (r = 0.45; p textless 0.05). HIIT specifically improved left PFC oxygenation
  and affects during exercise in individuals with obesity. Implementing HIIT in exercise
  programmes may therefore have relevant implications for the management of obesity,
  since greater affective response to exercise is thought to be associated with future
  commitment to physical activity.'
