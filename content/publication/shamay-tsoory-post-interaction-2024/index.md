abstract: Inter-brain coupling has been increasingly recognized for its role in supporting
  connectedness during social communication. Here we investigate whether inter-brain
  coupling is plastic and persists beyond the offset of social interaction, facilitating
  the emergence of social closeness. Dyads were concurrently scanned using functional
  near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) while engaging in a task that involved movement
  synchronization. To assess post-interaction neuroplasticity, participants performed
  a baseline condition with no interaction before and after the interaction. The results
  reveal heightened inter-brain coupling in neural networks comprising the inferior
  frontal gyrus (IFG) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex in the post-task compared
  to the pre-task baseline. Critically, the right IFG emerged as a highly connected
  hub, with post-task inter-brain coupling in this region predicting the levels of
  motivation to connect socially. We suggest that post-interactions inter-brain coupling
  may reflect consolidation of socially related cues, underscoring the role of inter-brain
  plasticity in fundamental aspects of relationship development.
