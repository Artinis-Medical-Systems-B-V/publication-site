abstract: "Aim: Montmorency cherries are rich in polyphenols that possess antioxidant,\
  \ anti-inflammatory and vasoactive properties. We investigated whether 7-day Montmorency\
  \ cherry powder supplementation improved cycling time-trial (TT) performance. Methods:\
  \ 8 trained male cyclists (V\u02D9 O 2 peak : 62.3 \xB1 10.1\_ml\_kg \u22121 \_\
  min \u22121 ) completed 10-min steady-state (SS) cycling at $\u223C$ 65% V\u02D9\
  \ O 2 peak followed by a 15-km TT on two occasions. Participants consumed 6 pills\
  \ per day (Montmorency cherry powder, MC; anthocyanin 257 mg\_day \u22121 or dextrose\
  \ powder, PL) for a 7-day period, 3 pills in the morning and evening. Capillary\
  \ blood [lactate] was measured at baseline, post SS and post TT. Pulmonary gas exchange\
  \ and tissue oxygenation index (TOI) of m. vastus lateralis via near-infrared spectroscopy,\
  \ were measured throughout. Results: TT completion time was 4.6 \xB1 2.9% faster\
  \ following MC (1506 \xB1 86\_s) supplementation compared to PL (1580 \xB1 102\_\
  s; P = 0.004). Blood [lactate] was significantly higher in MC after SS (PL: 4.4\
  \ \xB1 2.1 vs. MC: 6.7 \xB1 3.3\_mM, P = 0.017) alongside an elevated baseline TOI\
  \ (PL: 68.7 \xB1 2.1 vs. MC: 70.4 \xB1 2.3%, P = 0.018). Discussion: Montmorency\
  \ cherry supplementation improved 15-km cycling TT performance. This improvement\
  \ in exercise performance was accompanied by enhanced muscle oxygenation suggesting\
  \ that the vasoactive properties of the Montmorency cherry polyphenols may underpin\
  \ the ergogenic effects."
