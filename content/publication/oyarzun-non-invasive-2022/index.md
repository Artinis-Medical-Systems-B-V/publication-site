abstract: Abstract  Background Transverse myelitis (TM) is characterized by acute
  development of motor, sensory and autonomic dysfunctions due to horizontally diffused
  inflammation in one or more segments of the spinal cord in the absence of a compressive
  lesion. The not well-known inflammation process induces demyelination resulting
  in neurological dysfunction.   Case presentation In this case report we used a functional
  Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) technique to evaluate changes in the peri-spinal
  vascular response induced by a peripheral median nerve electrical stimulation in
  a patient with chronic transverse myelitis (TM). fNIRS showed drastically reduced
  signal amplitude in the peri-spinal vascular response, compared to that obtained
  from a healthy control group throughout most of the C7-T1 and T10-L2 spinal cord
  segments.   Conclusion The potential use of this relatively non-invasive fNIRS technology
  support the potential clinical application of this method for functional test of
  the spinal cord through the assessment of the spinal neurovascular response.
