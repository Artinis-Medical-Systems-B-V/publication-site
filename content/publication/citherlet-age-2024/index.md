abstract: Microvascular impairments are typical of several cardiovascular diseases.
  Near‐infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined with a vascular occlusion test provides
  non‐invasive insights into microvascular responses by monitoring skeletal muscle
  oxygenation changes during reactive hyperaemia. Despite increasing interest in the
  effects of sex and ageing on microvascular responses, evidence remains inconsistent.
  Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of sex and age on
  microvascular responsiveness. Twenty‐seven participants (seven young men and seven
  young women; seven older men and six older women; aged 26 ± 1, 26 ± 4, 67 ± 3 and
  69 ± 4 years, respectively) completed a vascular occlusion test consisting of 5 min
  of arterial occlusion followed by 5 min reperfusion. Oxygenation changes in the
  vastus lateralis were monitored by near‐infrared spectroscopy. The findings revealed
  that both women (referring to young and older women) and older participants (referring
  to both men and women) exhibited lower microvascular responsiveness. Notably, both
  women and older participants demonstrated reduced desaturation (−38% and −59%, respectively)
  and reperfusion rates (−24% and −40%, respectively) along with a narrower range
  of tissue oxygenation (−39% and −39%, respectively) and higher minimal tissue oxygenation
  levels (+34% and +21%, respectively). Women additionally displayed higher values
  in resting (+12%) and time‐to‐peak (+15%) tissue oxygenation levels. In conclusion,
  this study confirmed decreased microvascular responses in women and older individuals.
  These results emphasize the importance of considering sex and age when studying
  microvascular responses. Further research is needed to uncover the underlying mechanisms
  and clinical relevance of these findings, enabling the development of tailored strategies
  for preserving vascular health in diverse populations.
