abstract: 'Background: Mirror therapy (MT) has been shown to be effective for motor
  recovery of the upper limb after a stroke. The cerebral mechanisms of mirror therapy
  involve the precuneus, premotor cortex and primary motor cortex. Activation of the
  precuneus could be a marker of this effectiveness. MT has some limitations and video
  therapy (VT) tools are being developed to optimise MT. While the clinical superiority
  of these new tools remains to be demonstrated, comparing the cerebral mechanisms
  of these different modalities will provide a better understanding of the related
  neuroplasticity mechanisms. Methods: Thirty-three right-handed healthy individuals
  were included in this study. Participants were equipped with a near-infrared spectroscopy
  headset covering the precuneus, the premotor cortex and the primary motor cortex
  of each hemisphere. Each participant performed 3 tasks: a MT task (right hand movement
  and left visual feedback), a VT task (left visual feedback only) and a control task
  (right hand movement only). Perception of illusion was rated for MT and VT by asking
  participants to rate the intensity using a visual analogue scale. The aim of this
  study was to compare brain activation during MT and VT. We also evaluated the correlation
  between the precuneus activation and the illusion quality of the visual mirrored
  feedback. Results: We found a greater activation of both precunei during VT than
  during MT. We also showed that activation of primary motor cortex and premotor cortex
  contralateral to visual feedback was more extensive in VT than in MT. Illusion perception
  was not correlated with precuneus activation. Conclusion: VT led to greater activation
  of a parieto-frontal network than MT. This could result from a greater focus on
  visual feedback and a reduction in interhemispheric inhibition in VT because of
  the absence of an associated motor task. These results suggest that VT could promote
  neuroplasticity mechanisms in people with brain lesions more efficiently than MT.
