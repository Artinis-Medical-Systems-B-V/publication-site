abstract: "Altitude ascending represents an intriguing experimental model reproducing\
  \ physiological and pathophysiological conditions sharing hypoxemia as the denominator.\
  \ The aim of the present study was to investigate fractional oxygen extraction and\
  \ blood dynamics in response to hypobaric hypoxia and to acute resistance exercises,\
  \ taking into account several factors including different ethnic origin and muscle\
  \ groups. As part of the \u201CKanchenjunga Exploration & Physiology\u201D project,\
  \ six Italian trekkers and six Nepalese porters took part in a high altitude trek\
  \ in the Himalayas. The measurements were carried out at low (1,450 m) and high\
  \ altitude (HA; 4,780 m). Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-derived parameters,\
  \ i.e., Tot-Hb and tissue saturation index (TSI), were gathered at rest and after\
  \ bouts of 3-min resistive exercise, both in the quadriceps and in the forearm muscles.\
  \ TSI decreased with altitude, particularly in forearm muscles (from 66.9 to 57.3%),\
  \ whereas the decrement was less in the quadriceps (from 62.5 to 57.2%); Nepalese\
  \ porters were characterized by greater values in thigh TSI than Italian trekkers.\
  \ Tot-Hb was increased after exercise. At altitude, such increase appeared to be\
  \ higher in the quadriceps. This effect might be a consequence of the long-term\
  \ adaptive memory due to the frequent exposures to altitude. Although speculative,\
  \ we suggest a long-term adaptation of the Nepalese porters due to improved oxygenation\
  \ of muscles frequently undergoing hypoxic exercise. Muscle structure, individual\
  \ factors, and altitude exposure time should be taken into account to move on the\
  \ knowledge of oxygen delivery and utilization at altitude."
