abstract: The operating room (OR) is a dynamic and complex environment consisting
  of a multidisciplinary team working together in a high take environment to provide
  safe and efficient patient care. Additionally, surgeons are frequently exposed to
  multiple psycho-organisational stressors that may cause negative repercussions on
  their immediate technical performance and long-term health. Many factors can therefore
  contribute to increasing the Cognitive Workload (CWL) such as temporal pressures,
  unfamiliar anatomy or distractions in the OR. In this paper, a cascade of two machine
  learning approaches is suggested for the multimodal recognition of CWL in four different
  surgical task conditions. Firstly, a model based on the concept of transfer learning
  is used to identify if a surgeon is experiencing any CWL. Secondly, a Convolutional
  Neural Network (CNN) uses this information to identify different degrees of CWL
  associated to each surgical task. The suggested multimodal approach considers adjacent
  signals from electroencephalogram (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
  and eye pupil diameter. The concatenation of signals allows complex correlations
  in terms of time (temporal) and channel location (spatial). Data collection was
  performed by a Multi-sensing AI Environment for Surgical Task &amp; Role Optimisation
  platform (MAESTRO) developed at the Hamlyn Centre, Imperial College London. To compare
  the performance of the proposed methodology, a number of state-of-art machine learning
  techniques have been implemented. The tests show that the proposed model has a precision
  of 93%.
