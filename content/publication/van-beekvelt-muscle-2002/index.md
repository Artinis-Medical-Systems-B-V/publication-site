  Request Permissions Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a direct, non-invasive
  optical method for measuring local oxygenation and haemodynamics in muscle tissue.
  Although measurement of local oxygenation by NIRS has been used for the diagnosis
  of metabolic myopathies, the technique has not previously been applied to inflammatory
  myopathies. Dermatomyositis is a muscle disorder characterised by complement mediated
  capillary necrosis, resulting in ischaemia and hypoperfusion. We have now employed
  NIRS to study the effect of corticosteroid treatment on haemodynamics in muscle
  tissue in dermatomyositis. The pathological features of dermatomyositis are characterised
  by a decreased number of capillaries per muscle fibre and necrosis of single muscle
  fibres or clusters of fibres at the periphery of the fasciculi.1 Muscle fibre regeneration
  and an increased number of capillaries have been shown in dermatomyositis after
  intravenous immune globulin treatment,2 but corticosteroids are still considered
  to be the first line of therapy. In the clinical setting, the effect of treatment
  is mainly assessed by muscle strength and creatine kinase (CK) levels. Direct measurement
  of capillary and muscle fibre status can only be done by repeated muscle biopsies.
  However, apart from the fact that muscle biopsies are invasive, they are also a
  static representation of muscle tissue at a fixed time point and at a particular
  location (selection bias).
