abstract: 'Introduction: The role of skeletal muscle health on preventing and ameliorating
  chronic disease is emerging. The improvements in skeletal muscle metabolism are
  likely mediated by myokines, such as myostatin, IL-6, and decorin. Whether or not
  basal skeletal muscle health contributes to the myokine response to Whole body vibration
  (WBV), an exercise mimetic, has yet to be elucidated. Methods: Data from Sixty-three
  young adults (32.5± 0.7 years, 57.1% female, 42.9% non-Hispanic Black) were included
  from a longitudinal twin cohort study. Skeletal muscle oxidative capacity (SMOC)
  was determined using near-infrared spectroscopy by measuring the rate of skeletal
  muscle oxygen consumption after stimulation and was represented as a rate constant
  averaged over three trials (AvgRC). The acute WBV protocol consisted of 10 cycles
  of 1 min of vibration exercise followed by 30s of standing rest. Blood was collected
  at baseline (PRE), immediately post, and 1h, 3h, and 24h post WBV and myokine concentrations
  of IL-6, myostatin, and decorin were measured at each of these timepoints. Participants
  were divided into two groups by SMOC: low skeletal muscle oxidative capacity (AvgRC
  textless 1.82) and high skeletal muscle oxidative capacity (AvgRC textgreater 2.13).
  Results: Participant characteristics including age, BMI, body fat percentage, handgrip,
  and skeletal muscle index (SMI) were similar between groups. SMOC was positively
  associated with myostatin at baseline (ß= 564.6, SE=232.4, p=0.045) and 24H following
  WBV (ß= 661.0, SE=189.4, p=0.029). In addition, a significantly higher overall myostatin
  (p=0.026) and IL-6 response (p=0.001) to WBV was observed in in the high skeletal
  muscle oxidative capacity group when compared to the low skeletal muscle oxidative
  capacity group. Conclusions: Higher skeletal muscle oxidative capacity is associated
  with a greater myostatin and IL-6 response to acute WBV. These data suggest that
  a higher SMOC at baseline may positively impact the myokine response to WBV, independent
  of adiposity, and demonstrates the importance of skeletal muscle health on preventing
  and ameliorating chronic disease.'
