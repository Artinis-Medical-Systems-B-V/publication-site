abstract: "Introduction: Visuo-spatial working memory (VSWM) performances undergo\
  \ a decline throughout aging and are affected by the space in which the task is\
  \ performed (reaching or navigational). Cerebral oxygenation and cognitive capabilities\
  \ could explain this decline. We assessed the effects of age on cerebral oxygenation\
  \ of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in VSWM tasks in reaching and navigational\
  \ space. We also assessed cognitive correlates of VSWM performance in each space.\
  \ Method: Thirty-one (31) young adults (YA) and 24 healthy older adults (OA) performed\
  \ a battery of neuropsychological tests and the electronic Corsi Block-tapping Test\
  \ in reaching space (e-CBT) and in navigational space on the \u201CVirtual Carpet\u201D\
  \ (VWCT). Participants were asked to memorize and recall a sequential pathway, progressively\
  \ increasing from 2 to 9 blocks. Their span score reflected VSWM performance. The\
  \ dlPFC oxygenation (oxyhaemoglobin: $\u0394$O2Hb and deoxyhaemoglobin: $\u0394\
  $HHb) was measured by using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) during\
  \ the encoding of the sequential pathway in both tasks. Results: YA had higher span\
  \ scores than OA in both spaces. We identified a significantly stronger decrease\
  \ of $\u0394$HHb in YA compared to OA during encoding in VWCT. OA also exhibited\
  \ significantly lower cerebral oxygenation in VWCT compared to e-CBT. A decrease\
  \ of $\u0394$HHb was also associated with a better performance in VWCT. Finally,\
  \ we identified the association of mental rotation and executive functions with\
  \ VSWM performance in both tasks. Conclusion: VSWM performance and cerebral oxygenation\
  \ during encoding are impacted by aging. Space in which the task was performed was\
  \ found to be associated with different cognitive functions and revealed differences\
  \ in cerebral oxygenation."
