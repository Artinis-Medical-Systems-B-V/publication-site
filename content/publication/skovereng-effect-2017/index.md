abstract: "The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of cadence\
  \ on joint specific power and cycling kinematics in the ankle joint in addition\
  \ to muscle oxygenation and muscle VO2 in the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior.\
  \ Thirteen cyclists cycled at a cadence of 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 and 110 rpm at a\
  \ constant external work rate of 160.1 \xB1 21.3 W. Increasing cadence led to a\
  \ decrease in ankle power in the dorsal flexion phase and to an increase in ankle\
  \ joint angular velocity above 80 rpm. In addition, increasing cadence increased\
  \ deoxygenation and desaturation for both the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior\
  \ muscles. Muscle VO2 increased following increased cadence but only in the tibialis\
  \ anterior and only at cadences above 80 rpm, thus coinciding with the increase\
  \ in ankle joint angular velocity. There was no effect of cadence in the gastrocnemius.\
  \ This study demonstrates that high cadences lead to increased mVO2 in the TA muscles\
  \ that cannot be explained by power in the dorsal flexion phase."
