abstract: "This study quantified the inter- and intra-test reliability of telemetric\
  \ surface electromyography (EMG) and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during resistance\
  \ exercise. Twelve well-trained young men performed high-intensity back squat exercise\
  \ (12 sets at 70-90% 1-repetition maximum) on two occasions, during which EMG and\
  \ NIRS continuously monitored muscle activation and oxygenation of the thigh muscles.\
  \ Intra-test reliability for EMG and NIRS variables was generally higher than inter-test\
  \ reliability. EMG median frequency variables were generally more reliable than\
  \ amplitude-based variables. The reliability of EMG measures was not related to\
  \ the intensity or number of repetitions performed during the set. No notable differences\
  \ were evident in the reliability of EMG between different agonist muscles. NIRS-derived\
  \ measures of oxyhaemoglobin, deoxyhaemoglobin and tissue saturation index were\
  \ generally more reliable during single-repetition sets than multiple-repetition\
  \ sets at the same intensity. Tissue saturation index was the most reliable NIRS\
  \ variable. Although the reliability of the EMG and NIRS measures varied across\
  \ the exercise protocol, the precise causes of this variability are not yet understood.\
  \ However, it is likely that biological variation during multi-joint isotonic resistance\
  \ exercise may account for some of the variation in the observed results. \xA9 2014\
