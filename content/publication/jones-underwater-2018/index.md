abstract: The development of an underwater near-infrared spectroscopy (uNIRS) device
  has enabled previously unattainable measurements of peripheral muscle hemodynamics
  and oxygenation to be taken within the natural aquatic environment. The purposes
  of this study were (i) to trial the use of uNIRS, in a real world training study,
  and (ii) to monitor the effects of a swim training program upon muscle oxygenation
  status in short distance swimming. A total of 14 junior club level swimmers completed
  a repeated swim sprint test before and after an eight week endurance training program.
  A waterproof, portable Near-Infrared Spectroscopy device was attached to the vastus
  lateralis. uNIRS successfully measured changes in muscle oxygenation and blood volume
  in all individuals; rapid sub-second time resolution of the device was able to demonstrate
  muscle oxygenation changes during the characteristic swim movements. Post training
  heart rate recovery and swim performance time were significantly improved. uNIRS
  data also showed significant changes. A larger rise in deoxyhemoglobin during individual
  sprints suggested training induced an increase in muscle oxygen extraction; a faster
  recovery time for muscle oxygenation suggested positive training induced changes
  and significant changes in muscle blood flow also occur. As a strong correlation
  was seen between an increased reoxygenation rate and an improved swim performance
  time, these findings support the use of uNIRS as a new performance analysis tool
  in swimming.
