abstract: This study aimed at investigating the behavioral and neuro-electrical impacts
  of a coordinative exercise intervention on the updating function of the working
  memory (WM) in young children. Children in the experimental group was tested on
  the 1-back working memory task before and after a coordinative exercise program
  that involved a 60 min session twice per week for eight weeks (totally 16 sessions),
  while the control group underwent routine classroom activities with the same WM
  tests. The results showed that the hit rates of performing the 1-back task increased
  significantly in the experimental group compared with that of the control group.
  The experimental group demonstrated a larger decrease in both reaction time and
  false alarm rates from pre-test to post-test than the control group. Physical fitness
  improved after exercise intervention in the experimental group. Neural adaptations
  due to the exercise training were evaluated using functional near-infrared spectroscopy
  (fNIRS) and the results indicated that the experimental group experienced a greater
  cortical oxygenated hemoglobin (Oxy-Hb) increase in the prefrontal area after the
  intervention than the control group. These results suggest that coordinative exercises
  are beneficial for improving WM as well as reaction time and physical fitness in
  young children.
