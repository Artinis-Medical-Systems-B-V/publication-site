abstract: Previous findings indicate that facilitation of primary motor cortex (PMC)
  activity using trans-cranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) could improve resistance
  to physical fatigue. However, studies have failed to consistently replicate these
  results. Using non-focal-tDCS during a fatiguing task, recent work showed no enhancement
  of corticospinal excitability of the PMC despite a longer endurance time and suggested
  that contamination in other brain regions involved in motor command may have occurred.
  In accordance with recent evidence supporting the role of the prefrontal cortex
  (PFC) in exercise maintenance, this double-blind sham-controlled crossover study
  (N = 22) compared the effect of high definition (HD)-tDCS of the PMC or the PFC
  on endurance time of a sustained contraction task of the elbow flexor. Brain activity
  was monitored using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to measure the neurovascular
  response elicited by HD-tDCS. Electromyography (EMG) and force obtained during maximal
  voluntary and evoked contractions were assessed before and after the contraction
  task to explore the effect of brain stimulation on peripheral and central fatigue.
  While the stimulation affected the brain response in the PFC during the contraction
  task, no effects of the stimulation were observed on endurance time or fatigue indices.
  These results are discussed in relation to the neurocognitive models of physical
  effort.
