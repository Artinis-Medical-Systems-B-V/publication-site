abstract: Menopause is associated with reduced endothelial-dependent vasodilation
  and increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Dietary nitrate, a non-pharmacological
  approach, may increase vasodilatory capacity consequentially reducing CVD risk.
  We investigated macro- and microvascular function after acute nitrate supplementation
  in postmenopausal females (PMF). Vascular function was studied with flow-mediated
  vasodilation (FMD) and near-infrared post occlusive reactive hyperemia (PORH). Incremental
  handgrip exercise was performed to investigate blood flow and tissue oxygenation.
  We hypothesized acute dietary nitrate would not impact resting endothelial measures
  but would increase post ischemic vasodilation and incremental exercise blood flow.
  Late-phase PMF (n = 12) participated in a randomized crossover design with 140 mL
  of nitrate-rich (NR) beetroot juice or nitrate-poor black currant juice. Testing
  included a 5-min FMD, a 3-min ischemic exercise FMD, and incremental exercise at
  10%, 15%, and 20% maximal voluntary contraction to measure blood flow and pressure
  responses. A p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. One-way ANOVA indicated lower
  resting pressures, but no change to FMD, or PORH in either protocol. Two-way repeated
  measures ANOVA indicated NR supplementation significantly reduced mean arterial
  pressure at rest and during incremental exercise at all intensities without changes
  to blood flow. Acute nitrate is effective for resting and exercising blood pressure
  management in PMF.
