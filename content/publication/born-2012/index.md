abstract: "Purpose: The current investigation assessed tissue oxygenation and local\
  \ blood volume in both vastus lateralis muscles during 3000-m race simulations in\
  \ elite speed skaters on ice and the effects of leg compression on physiological,\
  \ perceptual, and performance measures. Methods: Ten (6 female) elite ice speed\
  \ skaters completed 2 on-ice trials with and without leg compression. Tissue oxygenation\
  \ and local blood volume in both vastus lateralis muscles were assessed with near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy. Continuous measures of oxygen uptake, ventilation, heart rate, and\
  \ velocity were conducted throughout the race simulations, as well as blood lactate\
  \ concentration and ratings of perceived exertion before and after the trials. In\
  \ addition, lap times were assessed. Results: The investigation of tissue oxygenation\
  \ in both vastus lateralis muscles revealed an asymmetry (P < .00; effect size =\
  \ 1.81) throughout the 3000-m race simulation. The application of leg compression\
  \ did not affect oxygenation asymmetry (smallest P = .99; largest effect size =\
  \ 0.31) or local blood volume (P = .33; 0.95). Lap times (P = .88; 0.43), velocity\
  \ (P = .24; 0.84), oxygen uptake (P = .79; 0.10), ventilation (P = .11; 0.59), heart\
  \ rate (P = .21; 0.89), blood lactate concentration (P = .82; 0.59), and ratings\
  \ of perceived exertion (P = .19; 1.01) were also unaffected by the different types\
  \ of clothing. Conclusion: Elite ice speed skaters show an asymmetry in tissue oxygenation\
  \ of both vastus lateralis muscles during 3000-m events remaining during the long\
  \ gliding phases along the straight sections of the track. Based on the data, the\
  \ authors conclude that there are no performance-enhancing benefits from wearing\
  \ leg compression under a normal racing suit. \xA9 2014 Human Kinetics, Inc."
