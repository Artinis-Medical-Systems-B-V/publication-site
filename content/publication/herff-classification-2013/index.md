abstract: "Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is rapidly gaining interest\
  \ in both the Neuroscience, as well as the Brain-Computer-Interface (BCI) community.\
  \ Despite these efforts, most single-trial analysis of fNIRS data is focused on\
  \ motor-imagery, or mental arithmetics. In this study, we investigate the suitability\
  \ of different mental tasks, namely mental arithmetics, word generation and mental\
  \ rotation for fNIRS based BCIs. We provide the first systematic comparison of classification\
  \ accuracies achieved in a sample study. Data was collected from 10 subjects performing\
  \ these three tasks. \xA9 2013 IEEE."
