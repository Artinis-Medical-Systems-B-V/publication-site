abstract: 'Purpose: To assess the association between skeletal-muscle endurance performance
  and mitochondrial oxidative capacity of the hamstrings as respectively measured
  by biomechanical and physiological standards. Methods: Nineteen (12 men and 7 women)
  healthy, young, recreationally active participants enrolled in our study. Participant
  characteristics comprised a mean and SD age of 21.3 (3.4) years, body mass index
  of 22 (3.3) kg/m2, hamstrings adipose tissue thickness of 13.1 (4.2) mm, and International
  Physical Activity Questionnaire score of 3692 (1528) metabolic equivalent-min/wk.
  Isokinetic dynamometry quantified total work, normalized to body mass (in joules
  per kilogram), performed by the hamstrings through a maximal number of dynamic contractions
  at 240°/s produced over 45 seconds. Near-infrared spectroscopy calculated the recovery
  of oxygen consumption rate, yielding the k (per minute) constant. The means of bilateral
  measures were analyzed. The Pearson product–moment correlation coefficient assessed
  the relation between normalized total work and k. Statistical significance was denoted
  as P textless .05. Results: Data displayed a normal distribution and randomness.
  The mean and SD were 69.2 (22.4) J/kg for muscle endurance and 1.78 (0.26)/min for
  mitochondrial oxidative capacity. There was a significant positive linear association
  (r = .68, P = .001) between isokinetic-dynamometry-derived normalized total work
  and near-infrared spectroscopy k values for the hamstrings, which can be regarded
  as moderately strong. Conclusions: The isokinetic dynamometry protocol described
  is applicable to infer mitochondrial oxidative capacity underpinning hamstrings
  endurance performance in young, healthy, highly active adults. Muscle oximetry is
  useful for inferring total work propensity of the hamstrings in these individuals.'
