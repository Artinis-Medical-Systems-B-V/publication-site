abstract: "Background: Fetal well-being is determined in large part by how well the\
  \ placenta is able to supply oxygen and nutrients, but current technology is unable\
  \ to directly measure how well a placenta functions. Near-infrared spectroscopy\
  \ (NIRS) utilizes optical methods to measure tissue oxygenation. This pilot project\
  \ evaluated the feasibility of NIRS for fetal monitoring through the maternal abdominal\
  \ wall using a sheep model. Methods: A miniature wireless 2-wavelength NIRS device\
  \ was placed on the abdominal skin over the placenta of a pregnant ewe whose fetus\
  \ had been chronically catheterized to allow arterial sampling for measurement of\
  \ arterial oxygen saturation. The NIRS device has 3-paired light emitting diodes\
  \ and a single photodiode detector; allowing measurement of an index of tissue oxygen\
  \ saturation (TSI%). Fetal limb TSI% values were compared before and during fetal\
  \ breathing movements. Correlation was made during these events between arterial\
  \ values and placental TSI% monitored continuously in real time. Results: Serial\
  \ measurements were obtained in a single experiment. The correlation between transcutaneous\
  \ NIRS derived TSI% and direct arterial oxygen saturation was very high (R2=0.86).\
  \ Measures of fetal limb TSI% were declined after episodes of fetal breathing (P\
  \ < 0.005). Conclusions: This correlation suggests that NIRS is sensitive enough\
  \ to detect changes in fetal tissue oxygenation noninvasively through the maternal\
  \ abdominal wall in real-time in a sheep model. NIRS data confirmed that fetal breathing\
  \ movements decrease arterial oxygen saturation in fetal lambs. If validated by\
  \ further study this optical methodology could be applied as means of monitoring\
  \ fetal wellbeing in humans. \xA9 2012 SPIE."
