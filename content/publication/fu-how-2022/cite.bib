 abstract = {A large number of scholars have conducted detailed studies on the effectiveness of commercial advertising by using neuroimaging methods, but only a few scholars have used this method to study the effectiveness of public service announcements (PSAs). To research the relationship between the effectiveness of PSAs and the audienceâ€™s implicit awareness, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was employed to record the neural activity data of participants in this study. The results showed that there was a correlation between activation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and the effectiveness of PSAs; The activation of the dlPFC could also be used as an indicator to represent the appeal of advertising content. The results means that neuroimaging tool can also be used to investigate the effectiveness of PSAs, not just commercial advertisements and a few PSAs study, and that neural activity can predict and improve the effectiveness of PSAs before they are released.},
