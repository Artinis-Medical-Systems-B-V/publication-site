abstract: "This study examined the effects of acute hypoxia on maximal and explosive\
  \ torque and fatigability in knee extensors of skiers. Twenty-two elite male alpine\
  \ skiers performed 35 maximal, repeated isokinetic knee extensions at 180\xB0s-1\
  \ (total exercise duration 61.25 s) in normoxia (NOR, FiO2 0.21) and normobaric\
  \ hypoxia (HYP, FiO2 0.13) in a randomized, single-blind design. Peak torque and\
  \ rate of torque development (RTD) from 0 to 100 ms and associated Vastus Lateralis\
  \ peak EMG activity and rate of EMG rise (RER) were determined for each contraction.\
  \ Relative changes in deoxyhemoglobin concentration of the VL muscle were monitored\
  \ by near-infrared spectroscopy. Peak torque and peak EMG activity did not differ\
  \ between conditions and decreased similarly with fatigue (p < 0.001), with peak\
  \ torque decreasing continuously but EMG activity decreasing significantly after\
  \ 30 contractions only. Compared to NOR, RTD, and RER values were lower in HYP during\
  \ the first 12 and 9 contractions, respectively (both p < 0.05). Deoxyhemoglobin\
  \ concentration during the last five contractions was higher in HYP than NOR (p\
  \ = 0.050) but the delta between maximal and minimal deoxyhemoglobin for each contraction\
  \ was similar in HYP and NOR suggesting a similar muscle O2 utilization. Post-exercise\
  \ heart rate (138 \xB1 24 bpm) and blood lactate concentration (5.8 \xB1 3.1 mmol.l-1)\
  \ did not differ between conditions. Arterial oxygen saturation was significantly\
  \ lower (84 \xB1 4 vs. 98 \xB1 1%, p < 0.001) and ratings of perceived exertion\
  \ higher (6 \xB1 1 vs. 5 \xB1 1, p < 0.001) in HYP than NOR. In summary, hypoxia\
  \ limits RTD via a decrease in neural drive in elite alpine skiers undertaking maximal\
  \ repeated isokinetic knee extensions, but the effect of hypoxic exposure is negated\
  \ as fatigue develops. Isokinetic testing protocols for elite alpine skiers should\
  \ incorporate RTD and RER measurements as they display a higher sensitivity than\
  \ peak torque and EMG activity."
