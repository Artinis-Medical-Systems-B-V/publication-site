abstract: We propose the signal quality index (SQI) algorithm as a novel tool for
  quantitatively assessing the functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signal
  quality in a numeric scale from 1 (very low quality) to 5 (very high quality). The
  algorithm comprises two preprocessing steps followed by three consecutive rating
  stages. The results on a dataset annotated by independent fNIRS experts showed SQI
  performed significantly better (p<0.05) than PHOEBE (placing headgear optodes efficiently
  before experimentation) and SCI (scalp coupling index), two existing algorithms,
  in both quantitatively rating and binary classifying the fNIRS signal quality. Employment
  of the proposed algorithm to estimate the signal quality before processing the fNIRS
  signals increases certainty in the interpretations.
