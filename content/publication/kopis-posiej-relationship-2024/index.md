abstract: 'Positive and negative consequences of using social media (SM) have been
  observed. Excessive use of SM, such as Facebook, can lead to problematic behaviours,
  resulting in emotional and social functioning changes. Moreover, the problematic
  use of SM is negatively associated with empathy''s affective and cognitive components.
  The present study used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to test empathy
  differences between problematic and non-problematic Facebook users. In addition,
  the Facebook-related context that may modulate empathic response was investigated.
  Fifty-two participants (25 females; Mage = 24.6 years [SD ± 2.9]) took part in the
  study and were classified into two groups: non-problematic and problematic Facebook
  users. The study was conducted using the empathy for pain paradigm with three media-related
  contextual conditions: newspaper, Facebook-related, and neutral. The results indicated
  there was a statistically significant difference between the left and right side
  of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) among nonproblematic Facebook users when observing
  pain stimuli in the context of Facebook. For problematic Facebook users, there was
  significantly more activity on the left side of the PFC (compared to the right side)
  when observing painful stimuli in the newspaper context and non-painful stimuli
  in a neutral context. The differences in haemodynamic activity registered by fNIRS
  between the left and right PFCs were observed in both groups and may have resulted
  from difficulties in regulating emotional response and attention, particularly among
  the problematic Facebook user group.'
