abstract: "Introduction: The ability to walk safely and independently is a fundamental\
  \ component of daily living activities. Walking while dual tasking and obstacle\
  \ negotiation are two tasks that have been used to investigate walking in complex\
  \ situations. Deficits in cognitive domains and sensory-motor processes associated\
  \ with aging and neurodegeneration impair the ability to successfully assess the\
  \ environment and react to it. These changes in the ability to walk are modulated\
  \ via neural circuits. However, the actual neural circuits of the brain involved\
  \ in the control of locomotion in different challenging situations are still poorly\
  \ understood. Methods: Two groups of subjects; 20 healthy older adults (mean age\
  \ 69.7\xB11.3 yrs, 50% females) and 47 persons with PD (mean age 71.7\xB11.1 yrs,\
  \ 32% females) were studied. The protocol included real and imagined walking while\
  \ negotiating obstacles and dual tasking. Walking conditions were performed while\
  \ being monitored with fNIRS and imagined walking were assessed in the MR scanner.\
  \ A repeated measures design (condition x group) was conducted with two levels;\
  \ within group and between groups. Results: Significant differences in brain activation\
  \ were observed in the fMRI and fNIRS. Between groups comparison showed that persons\
  \ with PD had a significantly higher activation in frontal, parietal, occipital,\
  \ and cerebellum regions during usual walking compared to healthy older adults (p<0.048).\
  \ Comparison between the walking tasks within each group revealed (1) increased\
  \ activation during walking while negotiating obstacles in both groups (p<0.023)\
  \ and (2) increased activation during walking while dual tasking only in healthy\
  \ older adults (p<0.035). Correlations between brain activation and performance\
  \ in motor-cognitive tests were found in both groups however, healthy older adults\
  \ presented inverse correlation and persons with PD positive correlation. Conclusions:\
  \ These findings indicate that subjects with PD activate larger brain areas than\
  \ healthy older adults even during usual walking. Perhaps, this increased activation\
  \ is a compensatory strategy to enhance performance. The increased activation already\
  \ during usual walking task may limit the ability to increase activation or recruit\
  \ additional brain areas during the more complex walking tasks and may contribute\
  \ to the high prevalence of falls and the dual tasking difficulty in persons with\
  \ PD."
