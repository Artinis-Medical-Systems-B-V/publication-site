abstract: "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive and portable\
  \ brain stimulation technique that is ideally suited to augment human brain performance\
  \ in everyday settings. The aim of this study was to measure and model the time\
  \ course of bilateral cortical hemodynamics (using functional near-infrared spectroscopy,\
  \ fNIRS) and neural activity (using electroencephalography, EEG) during tDCS. Subjects\
  \ received real (tDCS-1 and tDCS-2) and sham anodal tDCS (2 mA) targeting the left\
  \ sensorimotor cortex (SMC) via a 4 \xD7 1 high-definition electrode montage. Simultaneous\
  \ EEG (23 channels) and fNIRS (16 channels) were used to measure changes in left\
  \ and right SMC activity (EEG: frequency) and hemodynamics (fNIRS: oxyhemoglobin\
  \ concentrations, O2Hb) during the stimulation. The O2Hb time course showed a greater\
  \ increase in the fNIRS channels surrounding the anode in the stimulated left SMC\
  \ during the real tDCS sessions compared to the sham. In a subsample of five subjects,\
  \ a Kalman filter using an autoregressive exogenous model was able to appropriately\
  \ track O2Hb signals using EEG band-power signals. The neuronal (EEG) and hemodynamic\
  \ (fNIRS) responses in the stimulated left SMC region can lend to closed-loop control\
  \ of anodal tDCS for optimized neuromodulation in various neuroergonomic applications."
