abstract: Abstract  Microgravity has been shown to be a significant stressor on the
  cardiovascular system and the brain due to the redistribution of fluids that occurs
  in the absence of gravitational force, but there is scarce literature surrounding
  the effects of microgravity on cerebral hemodynamics and cognition. Understanding
  the early effects that simulated gravity has on cognitive function is essential
  for developing proper physical and cognitive countermeasures to assure safe and
  effective cognitive/decisions making while astronauts prepare for the initial launch
  or when they arrive in a microgravity environment. Therefore, this study aims to
  determine how an acute simulation of microgravity would alter cerebral oxygenation
  and executive functions. Sixty-five young healthy participants (22 ± 6 years, 21
  females) completed a thirty (30) minute horizontal (0 0 tilt) followed by a 90-min
  − 6° head-down-tilt (HDT) protocol. Cerebral oxygenation in the prefrontal cortex
  was monitored throughout the testing session using near-infrared spectroscopy. Cognition
  was also measured using a computerized Stroop Task. Our results demonstrate that
  cerebral oxygenation was higher during HDT compared to the horizontal supine position
  (9.11 ± 1.3 vs. 7.51 ± 1.8, p = 0.02). For the cognitive results, the non-executive
  performance of the Stroop task remained stable during HDT (652.46 ± 19.3 vs. 632.49 ± 14.5,
  p = 0.09). However, reaction time during the executive task performance was improved
  after the HDT (1058 ± 195–950 ± 158 ms, p textless 0.01). Our results suggest that
  an acute bout of simulated microgravity can enhance executive functioning.
