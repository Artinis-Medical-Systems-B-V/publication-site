abstract: "Background: The ability to sustain brief high-intensity intermittent efforts\
  \ (HIE) is meant to be a major attribute for performance in team sports. Adding\
  \ changes of direction to HIE is believed to increase the specificity of training\
  \ drills with respect to game demands. The aim of this study was to investigate\
  \ the influence of 90\xB0-changes of direction (COD) during HIE on metabolic and\
  \ neuromuscular responses. Methods: Eleven male, team sport players (30.5 \xB1 3.6\
  \ y) performed randomly HIE without (straight-line, 2\xD7[10\xD7 22 m]) or with\
  \ (2\xD7[10\xD7 $\u223C$16.5 m]) two 90\xB0-COD. To account for the time lost while\
  \ changing direction, the distance for COD runs during HIE was individually adjusted\
  \ using the ratio between straight-line and COD sprints. Players also performed\
  \ 2 countermovement (CMJ) and 2 drop (DJ) jumps, during and post HIE. Pulmonary\
  \ oxygen uptake (VO2), quadriceps and hamstring oxygenation, blood lactate concentration\
  \ ($\u0394$[La]<inf>b</inf>), electromyography amplitude (RMS) of eight lower limb\
  \ muscles and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were measured for each condition.\
  \ Results: During HIE, CODs had no substantial effects on changes in VO<inf>2</inf>,\
  \ oxygenation, CMJ and DJ performance and RPE (all differences in the changes rated\
  \ as unclear). Conversely, compared with straight-line runs, COD-runs were associated\
  \ with a possibly higher $\u0394$[La]<inf>b</inf> (+9.7 \xB1 10.4%, with chances\
  \ for greater/similar/lower values of 57/42/0%) and either a lower (i.e., -11.9\
  \ \xB1 14.6%, 2/13/85 for semitendinosus and -8.5 \xB1 9.3%, 1/21/78 for lateral\
  \ gastrocnemius) or equivalent decrease in electromyography amplitude. Conclusion:\
  \ Adding two 90\xB0-CODs on adjusted distance during two sets of HIE is likely to\
  \ elicit equivalent decreases in CMJ and DJ height, and similar cardiorespiratory\
  \ and perceptual responses, despite a lower average running speed. A fatigue-induced\
  \ modification in lower limb control observed with CODs may have elicited a selective\
  \ reduction of electromyography activity in hamstring muscles and may induce, in\
  \ turn, a potential mechanical loss of knee stability. Therefore, changing direction\
  \ during HIE, with adjusted COD running distances, might be an effective training\
  \ practice 1) to manipulate some components of the acute physiological load of HIE,\
  \ 2) to promote long-term COD-specific neuromuscular adaptations aimed at improving\
  \ performance and knee joint stability."
