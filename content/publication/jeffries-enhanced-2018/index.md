abstract: "Ischemic preconditioning (IPC), which involves intermittent periods of\
  \ ischemia followed by reperfusion, is an effective clinical intervention that reduces\
  \ the risk of myocardial injury and confers ischemic tolerance to skeletal muscle.\
  \ Repeated bouts of IPC have been shown to stimulate long-term changes vascular\
  \ function, however, it is unclear what metabolic adaptations may occur locally\
  \ in the muscle. Therefore, we investigated 7 days of bilateral lower limb IPC (4\
  \ \xD7 5 min) above limb occlusion pressure (220 mmHg; n = 10), or sham (20 mmHg;\
  \ n = 10), on local muscle oxidative capacity and microvascular blood flow. Oxidative\
  \ capacity was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during repeated\
  \ short duration arterial occlusions (300 mmHg). Microvascular blood flow was assessed\
  \ during the recovery from submaximal isometric plantar flexion exercises at 40\
  \ and 60% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). Following the intervention period,\
  \ beyond the late phase of protection (72 h), muscle oxidative recovery kinetics\
  \ were speeded by 13% (rate constant pre 2.89 \xB1 0.47 min-1 vs. post 3.32 \xB1\
  \ 0.69 min-1; P < 0.05) and resting muscle oxygen consumption (mimageO2) was reduced\
  \ by 16.4% (pre 0.39 \xB1 0.16%.s-1 vs. post 0.33 \xB1 0.14%.s-1; P < 0.05). During\
  \ exercise, changes in deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb) from rest to steady state were\
  \ reduced at 40 and 60% MVC (16 and 12%, respectively, P < 0.05) despite similar\
  \ measures of total hemoglobin (tHb). At the cessation of exercise, the time constant\
  \ for recovery in oxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb) was accelerated at 40 and 60% MVC\
  \ (by 33 and 43%, respectively) suggesting enhanced reoxygenation in the muscle.\
  \ No changes were reported for systemic measures of resting heart rate or blood\
  \ pressure. In conclusion, repeated bouts of IPC over 7 consecutive days increased\
  \ skeletal muscle oxidative capacity and microvascular muscle blood flow. These\
  \ findings are consistent with enhanced mitochondrial and vascular function following\
  \ repeated IPC and may be of clinical or sporting interest to enhance or offset\
  \ reductions in muscle oxidative capacity."
