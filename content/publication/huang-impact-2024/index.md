abstract: Background and Purpose There is a growing interest in use vibration foam
  rolling as a warm up and recovery tool. However, whether vibration foam rolling
  offers additional benefits to traditional foam rolling is unclear. The current study
  aims to compare the effects of acute foam rolling, with and without vibration, on
  skeletal muscle metabolism and microvascular reactivity. Methods Fifteen physically
  active young males were tested on two different days, with gastrocnemius muscle
  microvascular function assessed using near-infrared spectroscopy coupled with the
  post-occlusive reactive hyperemia technique, before and after foam rolling, performed
  with or without vibration. The slope of tissue saturation index (TSI) decrease during
  occlusion between 120 s to 150 s (TSI occlusion slope) was assessed for muscle metabolic
  rate. Three commonly used microvascular function indexes, including the first10s
  TSI slope after occlusion (TSI10), time for TSI to reach half of peak magnitude
  (TSI1/2), and TSI peak reactive hyperemia, were also assessed. Results None of the
  measured indexes showed significance for interaction or method (all p textgreater
  0.05). However, there was a main effect for time for TSI occlusion slope, TSI1/2,
  and TSI peak reactive hyperemia (p = 0.005, 0.034 and 0.046, respectively). No main
  effect for time for TSI10 was detected (p = 0.963). Conclusions The application
  of foam rolling can decrease muscle metabolism, and may improve some aspects of
  muscle microvascular function. However, vibration foam rolling does not seem to
  offer any additional benefits compared to traditional foam rolling alone.
