abstract: Abstract Treadmill training (TT) has been extensively used as an intervention
  to improve gait and mobility in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Regional
  and global effects on brain activity could be induced through TT. Training effects
  can lead to a beneficial shift of interregional connectivity towards a physiological
  range. The current work investigates the effects of TT on brain activity and connectivity
  during walking and at rest by using both functional near-infrared spectroscopy and
  functional magnetic resonance imaging. Nineteen PD patients (74.0 ± 6.59 years,
  13 males, disease duration 10.45 ± 6.83 years) before and after 6 weeks of TT, along
  with 19 age-matched healthy controls were assessed. Interregional effective connectivity
  (EC) between cortical and subcortical regions were assessed and its interrelation
  to prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity. Support vector regression (SVR) on the resting-state
  ECs was used to predict prefrontal connectivity. In response to TT, EC analysis
  indicated modifications in the patients with PD towards the level of healthy controls
  during walking and at rest. SVR revealed cerebellum related connectivity patterns
  that were associated with the training effect on PFC. These findings suggest that
  the potential therapeutic effect of training on brain activity may be facilitated
  via changes in compensatory modulation of the cerebellar interregional connectivity.
