abstract: "Background: The efficacy of interlimb-coordinated training on gait and upper limb functional improvement remains unclear. The latest published randomized controlled trials have supported the potential benefits of interlimb-coordinated training to enhance gait function. Upper limb functional recovery may also benefit from interlimb-coordinated training since most everyday activities require the coordinated use of both hands to complete a task. This study investigates the efficacy of interlimb-coordinated training on gait and upper limb functional recovery over a short-medium term period. Methods: A total of 226 acute stroke patients will be recruited from four centres over four years. Patients will be randomly allocated to either conventional therapy or conventional therapy plus interlimb-coordinated training. Outcomes will be recorded at baseline, after 2 weeks of intervention, and at 3- and 6-months post-intervention. Gait speed is the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures include Fuglâ€“Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery, Berg Balance Scale, Timed Up and Go test, Action Research Arm Test, electroencephalography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Conclusion: The results of this trial will provide an in-depth understanding of the efficacy of early interlimb-coordinated intervention on gait and upper functional rehabilitation and how it may relate to the neural plasticity process."
