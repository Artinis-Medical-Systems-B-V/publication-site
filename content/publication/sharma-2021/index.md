abstract: "Introduction: Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with loss of motor\
  \ control and difficulty exercising. This study measured skeletal muscle mitochondrial\
  \ capacity and endurance in individuals with and without PD using novel non-invasive\
  \ methods. We hypothesized that individuals with PD will have decreased mitochondrial\
  \ capacity, reduced oxygen recovery, and decreased endurance compared to controls.\
  \ Methods: Eight participants with PD and nine healthy controls were tested. Mitochondrial\
  \ capacity was measured as the rate of recovery of muscle metabolism after electrical\
  \ stimulation using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and repeated short arterial\
  \ occlusions. Oxygen recovery was measured as the half time of recovery of oxygen\
  \ levels after 5 minutes of ischemia. Muscle endurance was determined from changes\
  \ in twitch contraction acceleration during electrical stimulation at 2, 4, and\
  \ 6 Hz. Results: Mitochondrial capacity was lower in individuals with PD compared\
  \ to controls (1.5\xB10.1min-1 vs. 1.7\xB10.1min-1, p=0.02). Individuals with PD\
  \ had slower oxygen recovery after ischemia compared to controls (8.9\xB12.3s vs.\
  \ 5.4\xB10.8s, p=0.01). Endurance was not different between groups at 6 Hz (PD vs\
  \ controls: 58\xB123% vs. 69\xB116%, p=0.34). The effect sizes for mitochondrial\
  \ capacity and oxygen recovery were large (Cohen's d >0.8). The Cohen's d for endurance\
  \ was 1.11. Conclusion: Individuals with PD had slight impairments in mitochondrial\
  \ capacity and blood flow but did not have reduced muscle endurance. While our study\
  \ suggests that muscle metabolic dysfunction may play a minor role in exercise intolerance\
  \ in people with PD, it demonstrates the use of noninvasive technologies to evaluate\
  \ muscle function in people with neurological disorders."
