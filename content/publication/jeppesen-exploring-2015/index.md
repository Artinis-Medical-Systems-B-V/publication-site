abstract: Purpose Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has proved useful in measuring
  significant hemodynamic changes in the brain during epileptic seizures. The advance
  of NIRS-technology into wireless and portable devices raises the possibility of
  using the NIRS-technology for portable seizure detection. Methods This study used
  NIRS to measure changes in oxygenated (HbO), deoxygenated (HbR), and total hemoglobin
  (HbT) at left and right side of the frontal lobe in 33 patients with epilepsy undergoing
  long-term video-EEG monitoring. Fifteen patients had 34 focal seizures (20 temporal-,
  11 frontal-, 2 parietal-lobe, one unspecific) recorded and analyzed with NIRS. Twelve
  parameters consisting of maximum increase and decrease changes of HbO, HbR and HbT
  during seizures (1 min before- to 3 min after seizure-onset) for left and right
  side, were compared with the patients' own non-seizure periods (a 2-h period and
  a 30-min exercise-period). In both non-seizure periods a 4 min moving windows with
  maximum overlapping were applied to find non-seizure maxima of the 12 parameters.
  Detection was defined as positive when seizure maximum change exceeded non-seizure
  maximum change. Results When analyzing the 12 parameters separately the positive
  seizure detection was in the range of 6-24%. The increase in hemodynamics was in
  general better at detecting seizures (15-24%) than the decrease in hemodynamics
  (6-18%) (P = 0.02). Conclusion NIRS did not seem to be a suitable technology for
  generic seizure detection given the device, settings, and methods used in this study.
  There are still several challenges to overcome before the NIRS-technology can be
  used as a home-monitoring seizure detection device.
