abstract: 'Background: Blood flow restriction caused by peripheral arterial disease
  (PAD) is reflected in reduced walking capacity. The peripheral mechanisms that may
  affect the walking capacity of individuals with PAD are not yet fully understood.
  This study aimed to 1) compare tissue oxygenation and muscle metabolism of individuals
  with PAD with different walking capacities and 2) evaluate which variables have
  the greatest potential to explain the variability in distance walked between performance
  levels. Methods: The sample composed of adults diagnosed with PAD underwent evaluation
  of microvascular function in the gastrocnemius muscle through Near-Infrared Spectroscopy
  (NIRS) at two time points: (1) during the arterial occlusion maneuver; (2) on a
  treadmill test with constant speed and inclination (3.2 km/h, 10 %). The following
  NIRS parameters were selected: (1) percentage of peripheral tissue oxygen saturation
  (StO2); (2) StO2 delta; (3) reoxygenation rate; (4) time to reach lowest StO2; (5)
  ischemia resistance time; (6) StO2 in reactive hyperemia. Participants were divided
  into tertiles (T1, T2, and T3) according to the walking distance in the treadmill
  test. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for comparisons between tertiles
  and multiple linear regression was used for association analyses. Results: There
  were no significant differences between tertiles in baseline values or delta StO2.
  The reoxygenation rate and StO2 in hyperemia of the occlusion maneuver, as well
  as the time to reach the lowest StO2 and the ischemia resistance time in the treadmill
  test, were significantly higher in T3 than in T1 and T2 (p textless 0.05). Linear
  regression demonstrated that the ischemia resistance time is the variable that appears
  to have the greatest influence on the distance walked (adjusted R2 = 0.83). Conclusion:
  Better walking performance was associated with better dynamic response capacity
  to ischemia. Factors such as microvascular, endothelial, and muscular dysfunction
  appear to be decisive in reducing the walking capacity of individuals with PAD.'
