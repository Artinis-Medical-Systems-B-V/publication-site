abstract: "Background: Midazolam sedation and morphine analgesia are commonly used\
  \ in ventilated premature infants. Objectives: To evaluate the effects of midazolam\
  \ versus morphine infusion on cerebral oxygenation and hemodynamics in ventilated\
  \ premature infants. Methods: 11 patients (GA 26.6-33.0 weeks, BW 780-2,335 g) were\
  \ sedated with midazolam (loading dose 0.2 mg/kg, maintenance 0.2 mg/kg/h) and 10\
  \ patients (GA 26.4-33.3 weeks, BW 842-1,955 g) were sedated with morphine (loading\
  \ dose 0.05 mg/kg, maintenance 0.01 mg/kg/h). Changes in oxyhemoglobin ($\u0394\
  $cO2Hb) and deoxyhemoglobin ($\u0394$cHHb) were assessed using near infrared spectrophotometry.\
  \ Changes in cHbD (= $\u0394$cO2Hb - $\u0394$cHHb) reflect changes in cerebral blood\
  \ oxygenation and changes in concentration of total hemoglobin ($\u0394$ctHb = $\u0394\
  $cO2Hb + $\u0394$cHHb) represent changes in cerebral blood volume ($\u0394$CBV).\
  \ Changes in cerebral blood flow velocity ($\u0394$CBFV) were intermittently measured\
  \ using Doppler ultrasound. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MABP),\
  \ arterial oxygen saturation (saO2) and transcutaneous measured pO 2 (tcpO2) and\
  \ pCO2 (tcpCO2) were continuously registered. Statistical analyses were carried\
  \ out using linear mixed models to account for the longitudinal character study\
  \ design. Results: Within 15 min after the loading dose of midazolam, a decrease\
  \ in saO 2, tcpO2 and cHbD was observed in 5/11 infants. In addition, a fall in\
  \ MABP and CBFV was observed 15 min after midazolam administration. Immediately\
  \ after morphine infusion a decrease in saO 2, tcpO2 and cHbD was observed in 6/10\
  \ infants. Furthermore, morphine infusion resulted in a persistent increase in CBV.\
  \ Conclusions: Administration of midazolam and morphine in ventilated premature\
  \ infants causes significant changes in cerebral oxygenation and hemodynamics, which\
  \ might be harmful. Copyright \xA9 2006 S. Karger AG."
