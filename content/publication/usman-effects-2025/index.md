abstract: Introduction Successful execution of normal activities in various populations
  warrants the performance of dual tasks (DTs). DTs involve motor and cognitive tasking
  with the involvement of various brain areas. Transcranial direct current stimulation
  (tDCS) has been used for regulating the excitability of brain cortical regions.
  The purpose of this review was to evaluate the available scientific evidence on
  the effects of tDCS combined with concurrent DT walking on mobility, gait and cognition
  in older adults (OAs) with and without Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD). Methods The PubMed,
  PEDro, Cochrane Library, Embase and Web databases of Science were searched for relevant
  articles published from their beginning until date. Randomized controlled trials
  were retrieved, and their methodological quality and risk of bias were evaluated
  using the PEDro scale and the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool respectively. Qualitative
  and quantitative synthesis were used to analyze the data. Results Five studies were
  included in the review. The results revealed that in individuals with PD, active
  tDCS with concurrent DT walking has more potential to significantly improve DT cost
  to gait speed (p textless 0.05), and the proportion of correct responses during
  DT time up and go test (TUG)count (p = 0.004). DT walking with concurrent tDCS has
  potential to significantly improve DT [gait speed count (p = 0.03), cadence (p =
  0.0005), double limb support time (DBST) (p textless 0.0001), and single-task (ST)
  cadence (p = 0.008)]. Significant improvements were observed in the DT costs for
  stride time (p textless 0.0001), DBST (p = 0.03), stride time variability (p textless
  0.00001), and swing time variability (p = 0.002) with the active tDCS combined with
  concurrent DT training in OAs. Conclusions The effects of tDCS combined with concurrent
  DT walking or training on cognitive, gait and mobility outcomes in OAs with or without
  PD can be better explained by the DTW training itself. However, tDCS could produce
  some specific effects in particular outcomes and scenarios.
