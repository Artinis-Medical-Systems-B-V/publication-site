abstract: "Hypoxia and exercise each exhibit opposing effects on executive function,\
  \ and the mechanisms for this are not entirely clear. This study examined the influence\
  \ of cerebral oxygenation and perfusion on executive function during exercise and\
  \ recovery in normobaric hypoxia (NH) and normoxia (N). METHODS: There were 18 subjects\
  \ who completed cycling trials in NH (12.5% FIo2) and N (20.93% FIo2). Right prefrontal\
  \ cortex (PFC) oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb) and middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAbv)\
  \ were collected during executive function challenges [mathematical processing and\
  \ running memory continuous performance task (RMCPT)] at baseline, following 30\
  \ min of acclimation, during 20 min of cycling (60% V\u02D9 o2max), and at 1, 15,\
  \ 30, and 45 min following exercise. RESULTS: Results indicated effects of time\
  \ for Math, RMCPT, and O2Hb; but not for MCAbv. Results also indicated effects of\
  \ condition for O2Hb. Math scores were improved by 8.0% during exercise and remained\
  \ elevated at 30 min of recovery (12.5%), RMCPT scores significantly improved at\
  \ all time points (7.5-11.9%), and O2Hb increased by 662.2% and 440.9% during exercise\
  \ in N and NH, respectively, and remained elevated through 15 min of recovery in\
  \ both conditions. DISCUSSION: These results support the influence of PFC oxygenation\
  \ and perfusion on executive function during exercise and recovery in N and NH."
