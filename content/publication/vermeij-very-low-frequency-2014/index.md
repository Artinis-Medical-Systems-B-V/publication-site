abstract: "Spontaneous slow oscillations occur in cerebral hemodynamics and blood\
  \ pressure (BP), and may reflect neurogenic, metabolic or myogenic control of the\
  \ cerebral vasculature. Aging is accompanied by a degeneration of the vascular system,\
  \ which may have consequences for regional cerebral blood flow and cognitive performance.\
  \ This degeneration may be reflected in a reduction of spontaneous slow oscillations\
  \ of cerebral hemodynamics and BP. Therefore, we aimed to establish the dependency\
  \ of slow oscillations of cerebral hemodynamics and BP on the factors age and cognitive\
  \ load, by using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Fourteen healthy\
  \ young (23-32. years) and 14 healthy older adults (64-78. years) performed a verbal\
  \ n-back working-memory task. Oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin concentration\
  \ changes were registered by two fNIRS channels located over left and right prefrontal\
  \ cortex. BP was measured in the finger by photoplethysmography. We found that very-low-frequency\
  \ oscillations (0.02-0.07. Hz) and low-frequency oscillations (0.07-0.2. Hz) of\
  \ cerebral hemodynamics and BP were reduced in the older adults compared to the\
  \ young during task performance. In young adults, very-low-frequency oscillations\
  \ of cerebral hemodynamics and BP reduced with increased cognitive load. Cognitive\
  \ load did not affect low-frequency oscillations of the cerebral hemodynamics and\
  \ BP. Transfer function analysis indicated that the relationship between BP and\
  \ cerebral hemodynamic oscillations does not change under influence of age and cognitive\
  \ load. Our results suggest aging-related changes in the microvasculature such as\
  \ declined spontaneous activity in microvascular smooth muscle cells and vessel\
  \ stiffness. Moreover, our results indicate that in addition to local vasoregulatory\
  \ processes, systemic processes also influence cerebral hemodynamic signals. It\
  \ is therefore crucial to take the factors age and BP into consideration for the\
  \ analysis and interpretation of hemodynamic neuroimaging data. \xA9 2013 Elsevier\
