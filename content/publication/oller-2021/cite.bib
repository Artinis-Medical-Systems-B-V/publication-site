 abstract = {Excessive  adiposity  is  associated  with  altered  oxygen  tension  and  comorbidities  in  humans.  In  contrast,  marine  mammals  have  high  adiposity  with  no  apparent  detrimental effects. However, partial pressure of oxygen (Po2) in their subcutaneous adipose  tissue  (blubber)  and  its  relationship  with  fatness  have  not  been  reported.  We  measured Po2 and temperature at different blubber depths in 12 healthy juvenile grey seals. Fatness was estimated from blubber thickness and morphometric parameters. Simultaneously, we monitored breathing pattern; heart rate and arterial blood saturation  with  a  pulse  oximeter;  and  relative  changes  in  total  hemoglobin,  deoxyhemoglobin,  and  oxyhemoglobin  in  blubber  capillaries  using  near-  infrared  spectroscopy  (NIRS) as proxies for local oxygenation changes. Blubber Po2 ranged from 14.5 to 71.4 mmHg (39.2 Â± 14.1 mmHg), which is similar to values reported in other species. Blubber Po2 was strongly and negatively associated with fatness (LME: p < 0.0001, R2marginal  =  0.53,  R2conditional  =  0.64,  n  =  10),  but  not  with  blubber  depth.  No  other  parameters  explained  variability  in  Po2,  suggesting  arterial  blood  and  local  oxygen  delivery did not vary within and between measurements. The fall in blubber Po2 with increased fatness in seals is consistent with other animal models of rapid fat deposition. However, the Po2 levels at which blubber becomes hypoxic and consequences of low blubber Po2 for its health and function, particularly in very fat individuals, remain unknown. How seals avoid detrimental effects of low oxygen tension in adipose tis-sue, despite their high and fluctuating adiposity, is a fruitful avenue to explore.},
