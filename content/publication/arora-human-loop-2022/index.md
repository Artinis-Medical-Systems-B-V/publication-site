abstract: Individual differences in the responsiveness of the brain to transcranial
  electrical stimulation (tES) are increasingly demonstrated by the large variability
  in the effects of tES. Anatomically detailed computational brain models have been
  developed to address this variability; however, static brain models are not “realistic”
  in accounting for the dynamic state of the brain. Therefore, human-in-the-loop optimization
  at the point of care is proposed in this perspective article based on systems analysis
  of the neurovascular effects of tES. First, modal analysis was conducted using a
  physiologically detailed neurovascular model that found stable modes in the 0 Hz
  to 0.05 Hz range for the pathway for vessel response through the smooth muscle cells,
  measured with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). During tES, the transient
  sensations can have arousal effects on the hemodynamics, so we present a healthy
  case series for black-box modeling of fNIRS–pupillometry of short-duration tDCS
  effects. The block exogeneity test rejected the claim that tDCS is not a one-step
  Granger cause of the fNIRS total hemoglobin changes (HbT) and pupil dilation changes
  (p textless 0.05). Moreover, grey-box modeling using fNIRS of the tDCS effects in
  chronic stroke showed the HbT response to be significantly different (paired-samples
  t-test, p textless 0.05) between the ipsilesional and contralesional hemispheres
  for primary motor cortex tDCS and cerebellar tDCS, which was subserved by the smooth
  muscle cells. Here, our opinion is that various physiological pathways subserving
  the effects of tES can lead to state–trait variability, which can be challenging
  for clinical translation. Therefore, we conducted a case study on human-in-the-loop
  optimization using our reduced-dimensions model and a stochastic, derivative-free
  covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy. We conclude from our computational
  analysis that human-in-the-loop optimization of the effects of tES at the point
  of care merits investigation in future studies for reducing inter-subject and intra-subject
  variability in neuromodulation.
