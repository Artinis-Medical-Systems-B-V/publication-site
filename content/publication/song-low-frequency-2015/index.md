abstract: "The aim of this study was to investigate how the interrelationships between\
  \ low-frequency oscillations (LFOs) in the cerebral and systemic cardiovascular\
  \ hemodynamic systems change with aging and systemic hemodynamic perturbation. Seventeen\
  \ young adult (28.4 \xB1 3.5. years) and seventeen elderly subjects (69.4 \xB1 8.7.\
  \ years) underwent continuous measurements of arterial blood pressure (ABP), heart\
  \ rate (HR), and cerebral oxygenation (oxy-hemoglobin, deoxy-hemoglobin, and total\
  \ hemoglobin) using near-infrared spectroscopy. The LFOs were subdivided into three\
  \ frequency intervals (FI-1: 0.01-0.02. Hz, FI-2: 0.02-0.06. Hz, and FI-3: 0.06-0.15.\
  \ Hz) via spectral analysis based on continuous wavelet transform. The amplitudes\
  \ of the LFOs at these FIs were calculated to examine the effects of aging and head-up\
  \ tilt (HUT) on cerebral and cardiovascular hemodynamics. Granger causality (GC)\
  \ was used for analyzing the causal relationships between the LFOs observed in ABP,\
  \ oxy-hemoglobin, and HR. The amplitudes of the LFOs were generally higher in young\
  \ adults than in the elderly and increased significantly only in the younger subjects\
  \ after HUT. GCs in FI-3 oscillations were significantly higher in young subjects\
  \ compared to older participants in the HUT state. These results indicate that aging\
  \ dampens systemic and cerebral hemodynamic regulatory mechanisms, and the interrelationships\
  \ between systemic and cerebral hemodynamics become weaker with age."
