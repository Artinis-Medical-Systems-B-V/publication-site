abstract: The purpose of this study was to clarify the characteristics of muscle fatigue
  by measuring the oxygenation of muscles during wheelchair sprinting in wheelchair
  basketball players, using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). We believe that this
  information will be helpful in planning rehabilitation and training programmes.
  Five male wheelchair basketball players (mean age 30.0 ± 12.0 years, mean height
  166.0 ± 12.1 cm, and mean weight 61.0 ± 15.8 kg) participated in this study. These
  participants performed six 20 m sprint tests after warming up. NIRS measurements
  were obtained at rest before the start of exercise, during sprinting movements,
  and during the recovery time after sprinting. Measurements were taken using a wireless
  NIRS device (PortaMon, Artinis, The Netherlands; sampling rate, 10 Hz) with a single-channel
  system for tissue oxygenation measurements. The NIRS sensor was applied to the triceps
  muscle on the participant’s dominant arm and fixed with an upper arm supporter.
  The measurement data were imported into a dedicated computer and the tissue saturation
  index (TSI) was calculated. Statistical analysis was performed using the Friedman
  test to compare the TSI before sprinting and at each sprint, and a post hoc Bonferroni
  test was conducted. Compared to the pre-sprint measurements, TSI significantly decreased
  during sprints second, fourth, and fifth. In the present study, changes in the oxygen
  status of the triceps muscle during wheelchair driving varied greatly among individuals,
  and a tendency was observed towards the oxygen saturation being lowest by the fourth
  sprint, with the decrease being suppressed from this point on.
