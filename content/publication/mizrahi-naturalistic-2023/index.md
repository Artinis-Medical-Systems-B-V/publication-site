abstract: Disorder of consciousness (DOC) is a devastating condition due to brain
  damage. A patient in this condition is non-responsive, but nevertheless might be
  conscious at least at some level. Determining the conscious level of DOC patients
  is important for both medical and ethical reasons, but reliably achieving this has
  been a major challenge. Naturalistic stimuli in combination with neuroimaging have
  been proposed as a promising approach for DOC patient diagnosis. Capitalizing on
  and extending this proposal, the goal of the present study conducted with healthy
  participants was to develop a new paradigm with naturalistic auditory stimuli and
  functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) - an approach that can be used at
  the bedside. Twenty-four healthy participants passively listened to 9 min of auditory
  story, scrambled auditory story, classical music, and scrambled classical music
  segments while their prefrontal cortex activity was recorded using fNIRS. We found
  much higher intersubject correlation (ISC) during story compared to scrambled story
  conditions both at the group level and in the majority of individual subjects, suggesting
  that fNIRS imaging of the prefrontal cortex might be a sensitive method to capture
  neural changes associated with narrative comprehension. In contrast, the ISC during
  the classical music segment did not differ reliably from scrambled classical music
  and was also much lower than the story condition. Our main result is that naturalistic
  auditory stories with fNIRS might be used in a clinical setup to identify high-level
  processing and potential consciousness in DOC patients.
