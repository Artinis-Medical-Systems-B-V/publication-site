abstract: "Objective: To compare tilt-induced alterations in cardiovascular homeostasis\
  \ and cerebral oxygenation of spinal cord-injured (SCI) to able-bodied (AB) individuals.\
  \ Design: Subjects underwent 10 min supine rest followed by 10 min 70\xB0head-up\
  \ tilt. The last 5 min of supine rest and head-up tilt were analyzed, provided a\
  \ steady state existed. Subjects: SCI individuals (n = 11), with lesions between\
  \ C4 and T4, and AB individuals (n = 10), all males and balanced for age and weight.\
  \ Main outcome measures: Calf circumference, mean arterial pressure (MAP), stroke\
  \ volume, heart rate and cerebral oxygenated ([O2Hb]), deoxygenated ([HHb]) and\
  \ total ([tHb]) haemoglobin concentration changes were measured. Results: Head-up\
  \ tilt evoked a greater fall in MAP (mean (SD): -9 (12) vs 2 (6) mmHg P = 0.02)\
  \ and stroke volume(-43 (12) vs -22 (10)%, P = 0.005), and a greater increase in\
  \ heart rate (27 (12) vs 18 (6) beats, P = 0.04) in SCI than AB. Cardiac output\
  \ decreased during head-up tilt in SCT but not in AB (-17 (15) vs 1 (15)%, P = 0.01).\
  \ The change in cerebral oxygenation ([HHb]: 3.9 (2.8) rs 2.8 (1.4) $\u03BC$mol\u02D9\
  1-1, P = 0.1 and [O2Hb]: -6.1 (5.0) vs -2.1 (5.5) $\u03BC$mol\u02D9l-1, P = 0.1)\
  \ was similar in SCI and AB. All variables mentioned showed a change significantly\
  \ different from zero in both groups, apart from [O2Hb] in AB and [tHb] in both\
  \ groups. Conclusion: SCI demonstrated a greater decrease of MAP and stroke volume\
  \ with a similar decrease in cerebral oxygenation compared to AB. This suggests\
  \ that although systemic circulation was less well regulated in SCI compared with\
  \ AB, cerebral circulation in SCI was maintained as in AB."
