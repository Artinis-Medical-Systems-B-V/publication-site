abstract: "The aim of this study was to investigate local muscle oxygen consumption\
  \ (mVO2) during various protocols of isometric handgrip exercise. mVO2was measured\
  \ by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during sustained, rhythmic, and intermittent\
  \ isometric handgrip exercise. Whereas rhythmic handgrip exercise has the advantage\
  \ that local muscle metabolism can be measured over the full range from low- to\
  \ high-intensity work, the advantage of sustained handgrip exercise is that it is\
  \ less prone to movement artifacts. Intermittent isometric handgrip exercise enables\
  \ calculation of mVO2 at short time intervals providing information about the time\
  \ response of local oxygen consumption in relation to the onset of exercise. Ten\
  \ healthy subjects participated in this study. The different protocols were performed\
  \ on separate days and in random order. mVO2 during rhythmic exercise was significantly\
  \ higher than that during sustained exercise at all work intensities tested (P \u2264\
  \ 0.05). However, the highest oxygen consumption value for the three exercise protocols\
  \ was measured during the steady state of intermittent exercise (P \u2264 0.05).\
  \ These results show that the measurement of task-specific muscle metabolism during\
  \ exercise can be measured noninvasively and with relative ease by near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy. \xA9 (2003) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical\
