abstract: "Aims: We asked whether acclimatization to chronic hypoxia (CH) attenuates\
  \ the level of supraspinal fatigue that is observed after locomotor exercise in\
  \ acute hypoxia (AH). Methods: Seven recreationally active participants performed\
  \ identical bouts of constant-load cycling (131 \xB1 39 W, 10.1 \xB1 1.4 min) on\
  \ three occasions: (i) in normoxia (N, PIO2, 147.1 mmHg); (ii) in AH (FIO2, 0.105;\
  \ PIO2, 73.8 mmHg); and (iii) after 14 days in CH (5260 m; PIO2, 75.7 mmHg). Throughout\
  \ trials, prefrontal-cortex tissue oxygenation and middle cerebral artery blood\
  \ velocity (MCAV) were assessed using near-infrared-spectroscopy and transcranial\
  \ Doppler sonography. Pre- and post-exercise twitch responses to femoral nerve stimulation\
  \ and transcranial magnetic stimulation were obtained to assess neuromuscular and\
  \ corticospinal function. Results: In AH, prefrontal oxygenation declined at rest\
  \ ($\u0394$7 \xB1 5%) and end-exercise ($\u0394$26 \xB1 13%) (P < 0.01); the degree\
  \ of deoxygenation in AH was greater than N and CH (P < 0.05). The cerebral O2 delivery\
  \ index (MCAV \xD7 CaO2) was 19 \xB1 14% lower during the final minute of exercise\
  \ in AH compared to N (P = 0.013) and 20 \xB1 12% lower compared to CH (P = 0.040).\
  \ Maximum voluntary and potentiated twitch force were decreased below baseline after\
  \ exercise in AH and CH, but not N. Cortical voluntary activation decreased below\
  \ baseline after exercise in AH ($\u0394$11%, P = 0.014), but not CH ($\u0394$6%,\
  \ P = 0.174) or N ($\u0394$4%, P = 0.298). A twofold greater increase in motor-evoked\
  \ potential amplitude was evident after exercise in CH compared to AH and N. Conclusion:\
  \ These data indicate that exacerbated supraspinal fatigue after exercise in AH\
  \ is attenuated after 14 days of acclimatization to altitude. The reduced development\
  \ of supraspinal fatigue in CH may have been attributable to increased corticospinal\
  \ excitability, consequent to an increased cerebral O2 delivery. \xA9 2014 Scandinavian\
