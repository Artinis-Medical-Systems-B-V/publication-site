abstract: "Despite having a near perfect control over a ball, professional football/soccer\
  \ players often miss penalties. Psychological factors (anxiety) are often named\
  \ as explanations for these misses. A commonly used terminology is 'choking under\
  \ pressure'. In this study, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used\
  \ to study the influence of the brain on this process. An \u201Din the wild\u201D\
  \ study was set-up (N=22), involving both experienced and inexperienced football\
  \ players. Using permutation statistical tests, it could be concluded that activating\
  \ task-irrelevant areas of the brain (PFC) were related to missed penalties and\
  \ anxious players. Activating task-relevant areas, like the motor cortex, was associated\
  \ with not being anxious. These results are in line with the neural efficiency theory.\
  \ Furthermore the results of this study do suggest, no significant results, that\
  \ the left temporal cortex and the connectivity between DLPFC and the motor cortex\
  \ are involved as well. Anxious experienced players showed increased left temporal\
  \ cortex activity and for inexperienced the opposite was observable and a higher\
  \ DLPFC-motor cortex connectivity was related to performing under pressure. At last,\
  \ this study also shows that it is possible to get reliable results during an \u201D\
  in the wild\u201D fNIRS experiment, involving physical activity."
