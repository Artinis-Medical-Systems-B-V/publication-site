abstract: 'The rapid increase in population aging and associated age-related cognitive
  decline requires identifying innovative and effective methods to prevent it. To
  manage this socio-economic challenge, physical, cognitive, and combined stimulations
  are proposed. The superiority of simultaneous training compared to passive control
  and physical training alone seems to be an efficient method, but very few studies
  assess the acute effect on executive function. This study aimed to investigate the
  acute effect of simultaneous physical and cognitive exercise on executive functions
  in healthy older adults, in comparison with either training alone. Seventeen healthy
  older adults performed three experimental conditions in randomized order: physical
  exercise, cognitive exercise, and simultaneous physical and cognitive exercise.
  The protocol involved a 30 min exercise duration at 60% of theoretical maximal heart
  rate or 30 min of cognitive exercise or both. Executive functions measured by the
  Stroop task and pre-frontal cortex oxygenation were assessed before and after the
  intervention. We found a main effect of time on executive function and all experimental
  condition seems to improve inhibition and flexibility scores (textless0.05). We
  also found a decrease in cerebral oxygenation (Î”[HbO2]) in both hemispheres after
  each intervention in all cognitive performance assessed (p textless 0.05). Simultaneous
  physical and cognitive exercise is as effective a method as either physical or cognitive
  exercise alone for improving executive function. The results of this study may have
  important clinical repercussions by allowing to optimize the interventions designed
  to maintain the cognitive health of older adults since simultaneous provide a time-efficient
  strategy to improve cognitive performance in older adults.'
