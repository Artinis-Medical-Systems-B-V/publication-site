abstract: "During exercise, as end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO2) drops after the respiratory\
  \ compensation point (RCP), so does cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv) and cerebral\
  \ oxygenation. This low-flow, low-oxygenation state may limit work capacity. We\
  \ hypothesized that by preventing the fall in PETCO2 at peak work capacity (Wmax)\
  \ with a newly designed high-flow, low-resistance rebreathing circuit, we would\
  \ improve CBFv, cerebral oxygenation, and Wmax. Ten cyclists performed two incremental\
  \ exercise tests, one as control and one with PETCO2 constant (clamped) after the\
  \ RCP. We analyzed , middle cerebral artery CBFv, cerebral oxygenation, and cardiopulmonary\
  \ measures. At Wmax, when we clamped PETCO2 (39.7\xB15.2mmHg vs. 29.6\xB14.7mmHg,\
  \ P<0.001), CBFv increased (92.6\xB115.9cm/s vs. 73.6\xB112.5cm/s, P<0.001). However,\
  \ cerebral oxygenation was unchanged ($\u0394$TSI -21.3\xB113.1% vs. -24.3\xB18.1%,\
  \ P=0.33), and Wmax decreased (380.9\xB120.4W vs. 405.7\xB126.8W, P<0.001). At Wmax,\
  \ clamping PETCO2 increases CBFv, but this does not appear to improve Wmax. \xA9\
