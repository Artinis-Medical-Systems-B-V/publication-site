abstract: "Background: The aging process alters upright posture and locomotion control\
  \ from an automatically processed to a more cortically controlled one. The present\
  \ study investigated a postural-cognitive dual-task paradigm in young and older\
  \ adults using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Methods: Twenty healthy\
  \ participants (10 older adults 72 \xB1 3 y, 10 young adults 23 \xB1 3 y) performed\
  \ a cognitive (serial subtractions) and a postural task (tandem stance) as single-tasks\
  \ (ST) and concurrently as a dual-task (DT) while the oxygenation levels of the\
  \ dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) were measured. Results: In the cognitive\
  \ task, young adults performed better than older adults in both conditions (ST and\
  \ DT) and could further increase the number of correct answers from ST to DT (all\
  \ ps \u2264 0.027) while no change was found for older adults. No significant effects\
  \ were found for the postural performance. Cerebral oxygenation values (O2Hb) increased\
  \ significantly from baseline to the postural ST (p = 0.033), and from baseline\
  \ to the DT (p = 0.031) whereas no changes were found in deoxygenated hemoglobin\
  \ (HHb). Finally, the perceived exertion differed between all conditions (p \u2264\
  \ 0.003) except for the postural ST and the DT (p = 0.204). Conclusions: There was\
  \ a general lack of age-related changes except the better cognitive performance\
  \ under motor-cognitive conditions in young compared to older adults. However, the\
  \ current results point out that DLPFC is influenced more strongly by postural than\
  \ cognitive load. Future studies should assess the different modalities of cognitive\
  \ as well as postural load."
