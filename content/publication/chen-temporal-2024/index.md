abstract: Emotion recognition remains an intricate task at the crossroads of psychology
  and artificial intelligence, necessitating real-time, accurate discernment of implicit
  emotional states. Here, we introduce a pioneering wearable dual-modal device, synergizing
  functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) to
  meet this demand. The first-of-its-kind fNIRS-EEG ensemble exploits a temporal convolutional
  network (TC-ResNet) that takes 24 fNIRS and 16 EEG channels as input for the extraction
  and recognition of emotional features. Our system has many advantages including
  its portability, battery efficiency, wireless capabilities, and scalable architecture.
  It offers a real-time visual interface for the observation of cerebral electrical
  and hemodynamic changes, tailored for a variety of real-world scenarios. Our approach
  is a comprehensive emotional detection strategy, with new designs in system architecture
  and deployment and improvement in signal processing and interpretation. We examine
  the interplay of emotions and physiological responses to elucidate the cognitive
  processes of emotion regulation. An extensive evaluation of 30 subjects under four
  emotion induction protocols demonstrates our bimodal system’s excellence in detecting
  emotions, with an impressive classification accuracy of 99.81% and its ability to
  reveal the interconnection between fNIRS and EEG signals. Compared with the latest
  unimodal identification methods, our bimodal approach shows significant accuracy
  gains of 0.24% for EEG and 8.37% for fNIRS. Moreover, our proposed TC-ResNet-driven
  temporal convolutional fusion technique outperforms conventional EEG-fNIRS fusion
  methods, improving the recognition accuracy from 0.7% to 32.98%. This research presents
  a groundbreaking advancement in affective computing that combines biological engineering
  and artificial intelligence. Our integrated solution facilitates nuanced and responsive
  affective intelligence in practical applications, with far-reaching impacts on personalized
  healthcare, education, and human–computer interaction paradigms.
