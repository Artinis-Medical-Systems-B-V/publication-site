abstract: "Background: The Richalet hypoxia sensitivity test (RT), which quantifies\
  \ the cardiorespiratory response to acute hypoxia during exercise at an intensity\
  \ corresponding to a heart rate of $\u223C$130 bpm in normoxia, can predict susceptibility\
  \ of altitude sickness. Its ability to predict exercise performance in hypoxia is\
  \ unknown. Objectives: Investigate: (1) whether cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral\
  \ tissue oxygenation (O2Hb; oxygenated hemoglobin, HHb; deoxygenated hemoglobin)\
  \ responses during RT predict time-trial cycling (TT) performance in severe hypoxia;\
  \ (2) if subjects with blunted cardiorespiratory responses during RT show greater\
  \ impairment of TT performance in severe hypoxia. Study design: Thirteen men [27\
  \ \xB1 7 years (mean \xB1 SD), Wmax: 385 \xB1 30 W] were evaluated with RT and the\
  \ results related to two 15 km TT, in normoxia and severe hypoxia (FIO2 = 0.11).\
  \ Results: During RT, mean middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv: index of\
  \ CBF) was unaltered with hypoxia at rest (p > 0.05), while it was increased during\
  \ normoxic (+22 \xB1 12 %, p < 0.05) and hypoxic exercise (+33 \xB1 17 %, p < 0.05).\
  \ Resting hypoxia lowered cerebral O 2Hb by 2.2 \xB1 1.2 $\u03BC$mol (p < 0.05 vs.\
  \ resting normoxia); hypoxic exercise further lowered it to -7.6 \xB1 3.1 $\u03BC\
  $mol below baseline (p < 0.05). Cerebral HHb, increased by 3.5 \xB1 1.8 $\u03BC\
  $mol in resting hypoxia (p < 0.05), and further to 8.5 \xB1 2.9 $\u03BC$mol in hypoxic\
  \ exercise (p < 0.05). Changes in CBF and cerebral tissue oxygenation during RT\
  \ did not correlate with TT performance loss (R = 0.4, p > 0.05 and R = 0.5, p >\
  \ 0.05, respectively), while tissue oxygenation and SaO2 changes during TT did (R\
  \ = -0.76, p < 0.05). Significant correlations were observed between SaO2, MCAv\
  \ and HHb during RT (R = -0.77, -0.76 and 0.84 respectively, p < 0.05 in all cases).\
  \ Conclusions: CBF and cerebral tissue oxygenation changes during RT do not predict\
  \ performance impairment in hypoxia. Since the changes in SaO2 and brain HHb during\
  \ the TT correlated with performance impairment, the hypothesis that brain oxygenation\
  \ plays a limiting role for global exercise in conditions of severe hypoxia remains\
  \ to be tested further. \xA9 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."
