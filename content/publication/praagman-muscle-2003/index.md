abstract: "Local oxygen consumption in a muscle (V\u0307O2) can be determined by near\
  \ infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). In principle it should be possible to use this measure\
  \ to validate musculoskeletal models. However, the relationship between V\u0307\
  O2 and external force, or between V\u0307O2 and surface EMG, as a measure for muscle\
  \ activity, is hardly known. The aim of this study was: (1) to evaluate the characteristics\
  \ of the relationship between V\u0307O2 and external moments and (2) to determine\
  \ whether differences exist between the EMG-moment relationship and the V\u0307\
  O2-moment relationship. Subjects (n=5) were asked to perform isometric contractions\
  \ exerting combinations of elbow flexion and pro/supination moments at force levels\
  \ up to 70% of their maximum. Simultaneous surface-EMG and NIRS measurements were\
  \ performed on the m. biceps breve (BB) and the m. brachioradialis (BR). A linear\
  \ relationship was found between EMG and V\u0307O2. For the BB V\u0307O2 and EMG\
  \ were linearly related to both the flexion moment and the pro/supination moment.\
  \ However, for the BR only a linear relationship with flexion moment was found.\
  \ As expected, based on the findings above, the relationship between V\u0307O2 and\
  \ elbow flexion moment can be described by a linear equation, under the conditions\
  \ of this study (isometric, and force levels up to 70%). These findings suggest\
  \ that load sharing is independent of force level and that next to EMG, V\u0307\
  O2 can be used for the validation of musculoskeletal models. \xA9 2003 Elsevier\
