abstract: Researchers implementing non-invasive neuroimaging have reported distinct
  load-dependent brain activity patterns in older adults compared with younger adults.
  Although findings are mixed, these age-related patterns are often associated with
  compensatory mechanisms of cognitive decline even in the absence of direct comparisons
  between brain activity and cognitive performance. This study investigated the effects
  of cognitive load on brain-behavior relationships in younger and older adults using
  a data-driven, multivariate partial least squares (PLS) analysis of functional near-infrared
  spectroscopy (fNIRS) data. We measured bilateral prefrontal brain activity in 31
  older and 27 younger adults while they performed single and dual 2-back tasks. Behavioral
  PLS analysis was used to determine relationships between performance metrics (reaction
  time and error rate) and brain oxygenation (HbO) and deoxygenation (HbR) patterns
  across groups and task loads. Results revealed significant age-group differences
  in brain-behavior relationships. In younger adults, increased brain activity (i.e.,
  increased HbO and decreased HbR) was associated with faster reaction times and better
  accuracy in the single task, indicating sufficient neural capacity. Conversely,
  older adults showed a negative correlation between HbR and error rates in the single
  task; however, in the dual task, they demonstrated a positive relationship between
  HbO and performance, indicative of compensatory mechanisms under the higher cognitive
  load. Overall, older adultsâ€™ showed relationships with either HbR or HbO, but not
  both, indicating that the robustness of the relationship between brain activity
  and behavior varies across task load conditions. Our PLS approach revealed distinct
  load-dependent brain activity between age groups, providing further insight into
  neurocognitive aging patterns, such as compensatory mechanisms, by emphasizing the
  variability and complexity of brain-behavior relationships. Our findings also highlight
  the importance of considering task complexity and cognitive demands in interpreting
  age-related brain activity patterns.
