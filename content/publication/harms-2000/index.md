abstract: "Background and Purpose - Patients with orthostatic hypotension due to sympathetic\
  \ failure become symptomatic when standing, although their capability to maintain\
  \ cerebral blood flow is reported to be preserved. We tested the hypothesis that\
  \ in patients with sympathetic failure, orthostatic symptoms reflect reduced cerebral\
  \ perfusion with insufficient oxygen supply. Methods - This study addressed the\
  \ relationship between orthostatic tolerance, mean cerebral artery blood velocity\
  \ (V(mean), determined by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography), oxygenation (oxyhemoglobin\
  \ [O2Hb], determined by near-infrared spectroscopy), and mean arterial pressure\
  \ at brain level (MAP(MCA), determined by finger arterial pressure monitoring [Finapres])\
  \ in 9 patients (aged 37 to 70 years; 4 women) and their age- and sex-matched controls\
  \ during 5 minutes of standing. Results - Supine MAP(MCA) (108\xB114 versus 86\xB1\
  14 mm Hg) and V(mean) (84\xB121 versus 62\xB113 cm \u02D9 s-1) were higher in the\
  \ patients. After 5 minutes of standing, MAP(MCA) was lower in the patients (31\xB1\
  14 versus 72\xB114 mm Hg) as was V(mean) (51\xB18 versus 59\xB19 cm \u02D9 s-1),\
  \ with a larger reduction in O2Hb (-11.6\xB14 versus - 6.7\xB14.5 $\u03BC$mol \u02D9\
  \ L-1). Four patients terminated standing after 1 to 3.5 minutes. In these symptomatic\
  \ patients, the orthostatic fall in V(mean) was greater (45\xB16 versus 64\xB110\
  \ cm \u02D9 s-1), and the orthostatic decrease in O2Hb (-12.0\xB13.3 versus -7.6\xB1\
  3.9 $\u03BC$mol \u02D9 L-1) tended to be larger. The reduction in MAP(MCA) was larger\
  \ after 10 seconds of standing, and MAP(MCA) was lower after 1 minute (25\xB18 versus\
  \ 40\xB16 mm Hg). Conclusions - In patients with sympathetic failure, the orthostatic\
  \ reduction in cerebral blood velocity and oxygenation is larger. Patients who become\
  \ symptomatic within 5 minutes of standing are characterized by a pronounced orthostatic\
  \ fall in blood pressure, cerebral blood velocity, and oxygenation manifest within\
  \ the first 10 seconds of standing."
