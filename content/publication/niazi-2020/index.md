abstract: "There is growing evidence showing that spinal manipulation increases muscle\
  \ strength in healthy individuals as well as in people with some musculoskeletal\
  \ and neurological disorders. However, the underlying mechanism by which spinal\
  \ manipulation changes muscle strength is less clear. This study aimed to assess\
  \ the effects of a single spinal manipulation session on the electrophysiological\
  \ and metabolic properties of the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle. Maximum voluntary\
  \ contractions (MVC) of the ankle dorsiflexors, high-density electromyography (HDsEMG),\
  \ intramuscular EMG, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) were recorded from the\
  \ TA muscle in 25 participants with low level recurring spinal dysfunction using\
  \ a randomized controlled crossover design. The following outcomes: motor unit discharge\
  \ rate (MUDR), strength (force at MVC), muscle conduction velocity (CV), relative\
  \ changes in oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin were assessed pre and post a spinal manipulation\
  \ intervention and passive movement control. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to\
  \ assess within and between-group differences. Following the spinal manipulation\
  \ intervention, there was a significant increase in MVC (p = 0.02; avg 18.87 \xB1\
  \ 28.35%) and a significant increase in CV in both the isometric steady-state (10%\
  \ of MVC) contractions (p < 0.01; avg 22.11 \xB1 11.69%) and during the isometric\
  \ ramp (10% of MVC) contractions (p < 0.01; avg 4.52 \xB1 4.58%) compared to the\
  \ control intervention. There were no other significant findings. The observed TA\
  \ strength and CV increase, without changes in MUDR, suggests that the strength\
  \ changes observed following spinal manipulation are, in part, due to increased\
  \ recruitment of larger, higher threshold motor units. Further research needs to\
  \ investigate the longer term and potential functional effects of spinal manipulation\
  \ in various patients who may benefit from improved muscle function and greater\
  \ motor unit recruitment."
