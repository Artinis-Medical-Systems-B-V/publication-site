abstract: "Already in an early disease stage, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary\
  \ disease (COPD) are confronted with impaired skeletal muscle function and physical\
  \ performance due to a loss of oxidative type I muscle fibers and oxidative capacity\
  \ (i.e. oxidative phenotype; Oxphen). Physical activity is a well-known stimulus\
  \ of muscle Oxphen and crucial for its maintenance. We hypothesized that a blunted\
  \ response of Oxphen genes to an acute bout of exercise could contribute to decreased\
  \ Oxphen in COPD. For this28 patients with less advanced COPD (age 6567 yrs, FEV1\
  \ 59616% predicted) and 15 age- and gender-matched healthy controls performed an\
  \ incremental cycle ergometry test. The Oxphen response to exercise was determined\
  \ by the measurement of gene expression levels of Oxphen markers in pre and 4h-post\
  \ exercise quadriceps biopsies. Because exercise-induced hypoxia and oxidative stress\
  \ may interfere with Oxphen response, oxygen saturation and oxidative stress markers\
  \ were assessed as well. Regardless of oxygen desaturation and absolute exercise\
  \ intensities, the Oxphen regulatory response to exercise was comparable between\
  \ COPD patients and controls with no evidence of increased oxidative stress. In\
  \ conclusion, the muscle Oxphen regulatory response to acute exercise is not blunted\
  \ in less advanced COPD, regardless of exercise-induced hypoxia. Hence, this study\
  \ provides further rationale for incorporation of exercise training as integrated\
  \ part of disease management to prevent or slow down loss of muscle Oxphen and related\
  \ functional impairment in COPD. \xA9 2014 Slot et al."
