abstract: "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) results in a failure to adequately supply\
  \ blood and oxygen (O2) to working tissues and presents as claudication pain during\
  \ walking. Nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability is essential for vascular health and\
  \ function. Plasma nitrite (NO2-) is a marker of vascular NO production but may\
  \ also be a protected circulating \"source\" that can be converted to NO during\
  \ hypoxic conditions, possibly aiding perfusion. We hypothesized that dietary supplementation\
  \ of inorganic nitrate in the form of beetroot (BR) juice would increase plasma\
  \ NO2- concentration, increase exercise tolerance, and decrease gastrocnemius fractional\
  \ O2 extraction, compared with placebo (PL). This was a randomized, open-label,\
  \ crossover study. At each visit, subjects (n = 8) underwent resting blood draws,\
  \ followed by consumption of 500 ml BR or PL and subsequent blood draws prior to,\
  \ during, and following a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise (CPX) test. Gastrocnemius\
  \ oxygenation during the CPX was measured by near-infrared spectroscopy. There were\
  \ no changes from rest for [NO2-] (152 \xB1 72 nM) following PL. BR increased plasma\
  \ [NO2-] after 3 h (943 \xB1 826 nM; P \u2264 0.01). Subjects walked 18% longer\
  \ before the onset of claudication pain (183 \xB1 84 s vs. 215 \xB1 99 s; P \u2264\
  \ 0.01) and had a 17% longer peak walking time (467 \xB1 223 s vs. 533 \xB1 233\
  \ s; P \u2264 0.05) following BR vs. PL. Gastrocnemius tissue fractional O2 extraction\
  \ was lower during exercise following BR (7.3 \xB1 6.2 vs. 10.4 \xB16.1 arbitrary\
  \ units; P \u2264 0.01). Diastolic blood pressure was lower in the BR group at rest\
  \ and during CPX testing (P \u2264 0.05). These findings support the hypothesis\
  \ that NO2--related NO signaling increases peripheral tissue oxygenation in areas\
  \ of hypoxia and increases exercise tolerance in PAD. Copyright \xA9 2011 the American\
