abstract: "Background: Torsion of the testis compromises blood flow through the spermatic\
  \ cord; testicular ischemia results which if not diagnosed promptly and corrected\
  \ surgically irrevocably damages the testis. Current diagnostic modalities aimed\
  \ at rationalizing surgical exploration by demonstrating interruption of spermatic\
  \ cord blood flow or testicular ischemia have limited applicability. Near infrared\
  \ spectroscopy (NIRS) offers a non-invasive optical method for detection of ischemia;\
  \ continuous wave and frequency domain devices have been used experimentally; no\
  \ device customized for clinical use has been designed. Methods: A miniature spatially\
  \ resolved NIRS device with light emitting diode light source was applied over the\
  \ right and left spermatic cord and the difference in oxygen saturation between\
  \ the two sides measured. Results: In a 14-month old boy with a history of unilateral\
  \ testicular pain color Doppler ultrasonography was equivocal but the NIRS-derived\
  \ tissue oxygen saturation index (TSI) was significantly reduced on the left side.\
  \ Confirmation of torsion of the left testicle was made surgically. Conclusions:\
  \ Spatially resolved NIRS monitoring of spermatic cord oxygen saturation is feasible\
  \ in children, adding to prior studies of testicular oxygen saturation in adults.\
  \ Customized device design and further clinical trials would enhance the applicability\
  \ of NIRS as a diagnostic entity for torsion. \xA9 2014 SPIE."
