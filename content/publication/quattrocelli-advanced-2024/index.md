abstract: This study investigates the use of machine learning to differentiate between
  Parkinson's patients and healthy individuals using functional near infrared spectroscopy
  (fNIRS) signals collected during walking. fNIRS data, which monitor brain activity,
  were acquired from both groups to identify distinctive patterns. Using machine learning
  techniques, the model was trained to discriminate the two classes, with the goal
  of improving early and non-invasive diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and the method
  delivered an accuracy of 72.00%. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
  method in accurately distinguishing patients from healthy individuals from cortical
  activity during walking.
