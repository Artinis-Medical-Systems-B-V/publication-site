abstract: "Background: Blood flow to the limbs has shown to be significantly reduced\
  \ in elderly when  compared to their younger counterparts. The knowledge on the\
  \ effect of age on microvascular  function is still limited. Near infrared spectroscopy\
  \ (NIRS) is a non-invasive method which  can measure skeletal muscle microvascular\
  \ responsiveness and muscle oxygen uptake. Although NIRS is thought to be a reliable\
  \ method there are certain confounders like adipose  tissue thickness over the muscle\
  \ and physical fitness that should be considered. Objective: The main aim of this\
  \ study was to further investigate if there is a difference in muscle  microvascular\
  \ response and muscle oxygen uptake (mVO2) between elderly and young,  taking into\
  \ consideration physical performance parameters and adipose tissue thickness  (ATT).\
  \ The secondary aim of this study is to investigate the difference between an arterial\
  \  occlusion fixed for time and an arterial occlusion fixed for the level of desaturation,\
  \ between  elderly and young. Methodology: A total of 37 participants completed\
  \ the testing protocols,  19 young (25\xC2\xB10,5 years) and 18 elderly (69\xC2\xB1\
  1,4 years). To measure the participants  microvascular response and mVO2 two arterial\
  \ occlusion tests (AOT) were performed, one  with a fixed duration (AOT10) and one\
  \ with a fixed desaturation (AOT20). The performance  parameters measured were peak-incremental\
  \ dynamic handgrip test (IHT-peak) and whole body peak oxygen uptake (VO2-peak).\
  \ Results: No difference in microvascular response and  mVO2 between elderly and\
  \ young, in the m. vastus lateralis (VL). In the m. flexor digitorum  superficialis\
  \ (FDS) there was observed a higher mVO2 for the young group. We found a  relationship\
  \ between ATT for both microvascular response and mVO2 in the VL. While in the FDS\
  \ there was only observed a relationship between ATT and microvascular reperfusion\
  \ rate (RR). We did also find a weak relationship between peak IHT-peak duration\
  \ and the  microvascular hyperaemic response (\xCE\u201DSmO2-max) in the FDS. Our\
  \ study showed no  difference in microvascular response and mVO2 between elderly\
  \ and young when using  AOT20. While we did observe a difference in microvascular\
  \ response and muscle oxygen  uptake between AOT20 and AOT10. Conclusion: We found\
  \ no difference in microvascular  response and mVO2 between elderly and young for\
  \ neither AOT10 nor AOT20. We did  observe that ATT did affect the NIRS-signals.\
  \ We found a relationship between IHT-peak  duration and microvascular hyperaemic\
  \ response. We did observe a larger microvascular  response for the AOT10 compared\
  \ to AOT20."
