abstract: "Buzza, G, Lovell, GP, Askew, CD, and Solomon, C. The effect of short- and\
  \ long-term aerobic training years on systemic O2 utilization, and muscle and prefrontal\
  \ cortex tissue oxygen extraction in young women. J Strength Cond Res 33(8): 2128-2137,\
  \ 2019-This study aimed to determine if systemic O2 utilization (VO2) and tissue\
  \ oxygen extraction (deoxyhemoglobin [HHb]) in the vastus lateralis (VL), gastrocnemius\
  \ (GAST), and prefrontal cortex were different during exercise between short-term\
  \ trained (STT, 6-24 months) and long-term trained (LTT, >5 years) young women while\
  \ controlling for current training load. Thirteen STT and 13 LTT participants completed\
  \ ramp incremental (RI) and square-wave constant load (SWCL) tests on a cycle ergometer.\
  \ In LTT compared with STT: (a) VO2 was higher during the RI (p = 0.024) and SWCL\
  \ (p = 0.001) tests; (b) HHb in the VL (p = 0.044) and GAST (p = 0.027) was higher\
  \ in the RI test; and (c) there were significant group \xD7 intensity interactions\
  \ for VO2 in the SWCL test. The additional years of aerobic training in LTT compared\
  \ with STT (LTT 7.1 \xB1 1.9 vs. STT 1.5 \xB1 0.4 years) resulted in higher VO2\
  \ and HHb in the VL and GAST. These results indicate that in young women, independent\
  \ of current training load, systemic VO2 and peripheral muscle O2 extraction during\
  \ exercise continues to increase beyond 24 months of aerobic training."
