abstract: "The aim of the present study was to examine the respective importance of\
  \ locomotor profile and muscle oxygen uptake (mV\u0307 O2) recovery on repeated-sprint\
  \ ability (RSA) and overall repeated-sprint performance. 11 sprint- (STR) and 10\
  \ middle-distance-trained (MDTR) athletes (20.8\xB14.0 yr) performed an incremental\
  \ test and a 40-to-50-m sprint to estimate their maximal aerobic (MAS) and sprinting\
  \ (MSS) speeds. They also performed 6\xD730-m sprints, departing every 30 s, where\
  \ mean (RSmean) sprint time was calculated. Muscle oxygenation (Near-infrared spectroscopy,\
  \ NIRS, [Hbdiff]) was measured for $\u223C$ 4 min post test. The mean response time\
  \ of [Hbdiff]-mV\u0307 O 2 recovery (monoexponential curve fitting, MRT[Hbdiff]-mV\u0307\
  \ O 2) was calculated. Compared with MDTR, STR presented faster MSS (+11.4\xB16.7%,\
  \ with 99% chances to observe a substantially greater value) and RSmean (-3.7\xB1\
  5.4%, 78%), but slower MAS (-15.8\xB18.0%, 100%) and MRT[Hbdiff]-mV\u0307 O 2 (+46.2\xB1\
  31.7%, 96%). RS mean was largely correlated with MSS [r=-0.83 (90%CL, -0.92;-0.67)],\
  \ but neither with MAS [r=-0.12 (-0.47;0.25)] nor MRT[Hbdiff]-mV\u0307 O 2 [r=-0.27(-0.58;0.11)].\
  \ RSmean adjusted for MSS (which indirectly reflects RSA) was largely correlated\
  \ with both MAS [r=0.51(0.18;0.74)] and MRT[Hbdiff]-mV\u0307 O 2 [r=0.53(0.20;0.75)].\
  \ While a fast mV\u0307 O 2 recovery is associated with an improved RSA, MSS remains\
  \ of primary importance for overall repeated-sprint performance (i.e., RSmean).\
