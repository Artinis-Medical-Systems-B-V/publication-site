abstract: Background To understand the relationship between blood pressure changes
  during standing up and clinical outcome, cerebral oxygenation needs to be measured,
  which may be performed using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). However, the role
  of potential determinants of NIRS-derived orthostatic cerebral oxygenation, i.e.,
  age, sex, type of postural change (i.e., standing up from sitting versus supine
  position), blood pressure (BP) and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) is still unknown
  and needed to better interpret findings from studies using orthostatic NIRS measurements.  Methods
  34 younger (median age 25 years, inter quartile range (IQR) 22–45) and 31 older
  adults (median age 77 years, IQR 72–81) underwent BP, BRS and NIRS measurements
  during standing up from sitting and supine position. Linear regression models were
  used to assess the potential determinant role of age, sex, type of postural change,
  BP and BRS in orthostatic cerebral oxygenation drop and recovery. Orthostatic cerebral
  oxygenation test-retest reliability was assessed using intra class correlations.  Results
  Younger age, male sex and standing up from supine compared to sitting position were
  positively associated with cerebral oxygenation drop; older age and standing up
  from sitting compared to supine position were associated with higher cerebral oxygenation
  recovery. Test-retest reliability was highest (ICC textgreater 0.83) during standing
  up from supine position.  Conclusion Based on the findings of this study, age, sex
  and type of postural change are significant determinants of NIRS-derived orthostatic
  cerebral oxygenation and should be taken into account in the interpretation of NIRS
  measurements. In the design of new studies, standing up from supine position is
  preferable (higher reliability) over standing up from sitting position.
