abstract: "Purpose: To examine the reliability and the maturity-related differences\
  \ of fatigue thresholds (FTs) among youth males. Methods: Twenty-nine youth males\
  \ (11\u201317 y) completed 2 ramp exercise tests on a cycle ergometer. Systemic\
  \ FTs were calculated from gas exchange and ventilation variables. Localized FTs\
  \ were calculated from electromyography and near-infrared spectroscopy of the vastus\
  \ lateralis. All FTs were determined using the maximal distance method and expressed\
  \ relative to maximal oxygen consumption. All participants were grouped according\
  \ to the number of years from peak height velocity into PRE- (< \u22121.5 y), PERI-\
  \ (\u22121.5 to +1.5 y) and POST- (> +1.5 y) peak height velocity. Reliability was\
  \ assessed with intraclass correlation coefficients, and differences between groups\
  \ were assessed with analysis of variance and Cohen's d coefficients. Results: Analysis\
  \ of variance revealed significant group differences with PRE having significantly\
  \ greater systemic pulmonary FTs than POST, while localized muscular FTs were significantly\
  \ greater in PRE when compared with PERI and POST. All FTs exhibited excellent reliability\
  \ (intraclass correlation coefficient > .75) in all maturity groups. Conclusion:\
  \ Maturity status appears to influence the onset of FTs among youth male athletes,\
  \ with FTs occurring later in younger athletes. Furthermore, all FTs were reliable\
  \ measures regardless of maturity."
