abstract: 'Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of fatigue
  on muscular performance, oxygenation saturation, and cognition following acute hypoxic
  exposure at Normoxia, Moderate Hypoxia (MH), and Severe Hypoxia (SH).  Methods Twelve
  males performed 3 sets of leg extensions to failure under Normoxia (FiO2: 21%),
  MH (Fi02: 15.4%), and SH (Fi02: 12.9%). Heart rate, peripheral oxygenation saturation,
  total saturation index, psychomotor vigilance testing reaction time, psychomotor
  vigilance error rate, maximum strength, and repetitions to failure were measured
  throughout each visit.  Results The primary findings indicated that MH and SH resulted
  in significant decreases in psychomotor vigilance test performance (MH: 388.25–427.17
  ms, 0.41–0.33 error rate; SH: 398.17–445.42 ms reaction time, 0.25–1.00 error rate),
  absolute muscle tissue oxygen saturation (Abs-StO2) (MH:67.22% compared to SH:57.56%),
  but similar muscular strength, heart rate, and patterns of muscle tissue oxygen
  saturation responses (StO2%) during fatigue when compared to Normoxia. There was
  an acute decrease in the ability to remain vigilant and/or respond correctly to
  visual stimuli as indicated by the worsened reaction time (PVTRT) during MH (FiO2:
  15.4%) and increased PVTRT and error rate (PVTE) during SH (FiO2: 12.9%) conditions.  Conclusions
  Acute hypoxic exposure in the current study was not a sufficient stimuli to elicit
  hypoxic-related changes in HR, muscular strength (1-RM), or repetitions to failure.
  The SpO2 responses were hypoxic-level dependent with increasing levels of hypoxia
  resulting in greater and more sustained reductions in SpO2. The combined SpO2 and
  StO2 responses at MH and SH suggested a balance between the muscles metabolic demand
  remaining lower than the muscle oxygen diffusion capacity. During the SH condition,
  Abs-StO2 suggested greater metabolic stress than Normoxia and MH conditions during
  the fatiguing leg extensions. The patterns of responses for StO2% during the three
  sets of leg press to failure indicated that exercise is a more potent influencer
  to muscle oxygenation status than hypoxic conditions (FiO2: 15.4 and 12.9%).'
