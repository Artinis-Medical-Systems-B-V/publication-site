abstract: "We describe a case of experimentally induced pre-syncope in a healthy young\
  \ man when exposed to increased inspired CO2 in a background of hypoxia. Acute severe\
  \ hypoxia (FIO2=0.10) was tolerated, but adding CO2 to the inspirate caused pre-syncope\
  \ symptoms accompanied by hypotension and large reductions in both mean and diastolic\
  \ middle cerebral artery velocity, while systolic flow velocity was maintained.\
  \ The mismatch of cerebral perfusion pressure and vascular tone caused unique retrograde\
  \ cerebral blood flow at the end of systole and a reduction in cerebral tissue oxygenation.\
  \ We speculate that this occurrence of pre-syncope was due to hypoxia-induced inhibition\
  \ of brain regions responsible for compensatory sympathetic activity to relative\
  \ hypercapnia. \xA9 Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014."
