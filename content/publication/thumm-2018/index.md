abstract: "Background: Among patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), gait is typically\
  \ disturbed and less automatic. These gait changes are associated with impaired\
  \ rhythmicity and increased prefrontal activation, presumably in an attempt to compensate\
  \ for reduced automaticity. Research question: We investigated whether during treadmill\
  \ walking, when the pace is determined and fixed, prefrontal activation in patients\
  \ with PD is lower, as compared to over-ground walking. Methods: Twenty patients\
  \ with PD (age: 69.8 \xB1 6.5 yrs.; MoCA: 26.9 \xB1 2.4; disease duration: 7.9 \xB1\
  \ 4.2 yrs) walked at a self-selected walking speed over-ground and on a treadmill.\
  \ A wireless functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) system measured prefrontal\
  \ lobe activation, i.e., oxygenated hemoglobin (Hb02) in the pre-frontal area. Gait\
  \ was evaluated using 3D-accelerometers attached to the lower back and ankles (Opal\u2122\
  \ APDM). Dynamic gait stability was assessed using the maximum Lyapunov exponent\
  \ to investigate automaticity of the walking pattern. Results: Hb02 was lower during\
  \ treadmill walking than during over-ground walking (p = 0.001). Gait stability\
  \ was greater on the treadmill, compared to over-ground walking, in both the anteroposterior\
  \ and medio-lateral axes (p < 0.001). Significance: These findings support the notion\
  \ that when gait is externally paced, prefrontal lobe activation is reduced in patients\
  \ with PD, perhaps reflecting a reduced need for compensatory cognitive mechanisms."
