abstract: The development of novel miniaturized wireless and wearable functional near-infrared
  spectroscopy (fNIRS) devices has paved the way for new functional brain imaging
  that could revolutionize the cognitive research fields. Over the past few decades,
  several studies have been conducted with conventional fNIRS systems that have demonstrated
  the suitability of this technology for a wide variety of populations and applications,
  to investigate both the healthy brain and the diseased brain. However, what makes
  wearable fNIRS even more appealing is its capability to allow measurements in everyday-life
  scenarios that are not possible with other gold-standard neuroimaging modalities,
  such as functional magnetic resonance imaging. This could have a huge impact on
  the way we explore the neural bases and mechanisms underpinning human brain functioning.
  The aim of this review is to provide an overview of studies conducted with wearable
  fNIRS in naturalistic settings in the field of cognitive neuroscience. In addition,
  we present the challenges associated with the use of wearable fNIRS in unrestrained
  contexts, discussing solutions that will allow accurate inference of functional
  brain activity. Finally, we provide an overview of the future perspectives in cognitive
  neuroscience that we believe would benefit the most from the study of wearable fNIRS
  devices.
