abstract: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a recessive genetic disorder marked by
  a deficiency in SMN2 protein, primarily affecting lower motor neurons and the neuromuscular
  junction, leading to muscle weakness and fatigue. While neuronal and neuromuscular
  pathology are central to SMA symptoms, emerging evidence indicates significant non-neuronal
  tissue changes. Recent disease-modifying therapies targeting the central nervous
  system can enhance SMN2 production and mitigate clinical severity; however, persistent
  weakness and fatigue suggest underlying muscle pathology that these treatments do
  not address. Animal models of SMA have revealed mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired
  biogenesis. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive technique that allows
  for real-time assessment of local oxygen metabolism in skeletal muscle in vivo.
  Previous NIRS studies in SMA have demonstrated decreased oxygen consumption and
  increased fatigue, aligning with findings from cardiopulmonary exercise testing
  (CPET). NIRS can provide insights into muscle tissue characteristics and potential
  therapeutic targets. In this study, we evaluated 45 participants (8 controls and
  37 with SMA) during the assisted six-minute cycle test (A6MCT). Each participant
  engaged in a 6-minute upper extremity exercise followed by a 5-minute recovery period,
  wearing two portable SRS NIRS devices (Artinis, PortaLite) on the bicep and triceps.
  These devices measured relative changes in deoxyhemoglobin (ΔHHb) and oxyhemoglobin
  (ΔO2Hb) at 10 Hz during both periods. The data were used to calculate the tissue
  saturation index (TSI), a semi-quantitative measure reflecting real-time muscle
  oxygen saturation, which correlates closely with the minute rate of oxygen consumption
  (VO2m). Group-level comparisons revealed that SMA participants exhibited significantly
  higher minimum oxygen saturation (61.54 ± 5.56) and a reduced slope (-9.35 ± 5.54)
  during exercise compared to controls (58.67 ± 5.53 and -11.65 ± 3.56). During recovery,
  SMA patients showed a lower maximum TSI (78.1 ± 3.21) and a slower recovery rate
  (15.41 ± 3.56) compared to controls (82.24 ± 5.58 and 21.3 ± 3.2). This study confirms
  reduced skeletal muscle function and oxidative capacity in SMA during exercise,
  consistent with prior research. The diminished magnitude and slower recovery rate
  observed in SMA patients suggest primary muscle pathology, potentially linked to
  mitochondrial dysfunction. Further investigation, in conjunction with CPET and electromyography
  (EMG), is essential to elucidate the impact on skeletal muscle function and identify
  mechanisms that could inform more effective treatments.
