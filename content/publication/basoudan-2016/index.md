abstract: "Purpose: To non-invasively examine the effect of acute hypoxia and inspiratory\
  \ threshold loading (ITL) on inspiratory muscles [sternocleidomastoid (SCM), scalene\
  \ (SA) and parasternal (PS)] oxygenation in healthy adults using near-infrared spectroscopy\
  \ (NIRS). Methods: Twenty healthy adults (12\_M/8\_F) were randomly assigned to\
  \ perform two ITL tests while breathing a normoxic or hypoxic (FIO2\_=\_15\_%) gas\
  \ mixture. NIRS devices were placed over the SCM, PS, SA, and a control muscle,\
  \ tibialis anterior (TA), to monitor oxygenated (O2Hb), deoxygenated (HHb), total\
  \ hemoglobin (tHb) and tissue saturation index (TSI). With the nose occluded, subjects\
  \ breathed normally for 4\_min through a mouthpiece that was connected to a weighted\
  \ threshold loading device. ITL began by adding a 100-g weight to the ITL device.\
  \ Then, every 2\_min 50-g was added until task failure. Vital signs, ECG and ventilatory\
  \ measures were monitored throughout the protocol. Result: Participants were 31\_\
  \xB1\_12\_year and had normal spirometry. At task failure, the maximum load and\
  \ ventilatory parameters did not differ between the hypoxic and normoxic ITL. At\
  \ hypoxic ITL task failure, SpO2 was significantly lower, and \u2206HHb increased\
  \ more so in SA, SCM and PS than normoxic values. SCM \u2206TSI decreased more so\
  \ during hypoxic compared to normoxic ITL. \u2206tHb in the inspiratory muscles\
  \ (SCM, PS and SA) increased significantly compared to the decrease in TA during\
  \ both hypoxic and normoxic ITL. Conclusion: The SCM, an accessory inspiratory muscle\
  \ was the most vulnerable to deoxygenation during incremental loading and this response\
  \ was accentuated by acute hypoxia."
