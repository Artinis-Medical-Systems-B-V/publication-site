abstract: Over the past decades, virtual reality (VR) technology has gained significant
  popularity and interest, both in research as well as on the consumer market. One
  promising application area of VR is virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET), which
  treats anxiety disorders by gradually exposing the patient to his/her fear using
  VR. To make VRET safe and effective, it is important to monitor the patient?s fear
  levels during the exposure. Non-invasive neuroimaging can be used to unobtrusively
  detect fear responses, among which functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
  technology exhibits the greatest potential for a combination with VR, due to its
  comparably low susceptibility to motion artifacts. This thesis aims to investigate
  to what extent the fNIRS signals captured from people with a fear of heights response
  and people without a fear of heights response during VR exposure differ, and to
  what extent a person?s fear of heights response to a VR environment can be detected
  using fNIRS data. Only a very limited amount of work has investigated how fear responses
  are reflected in fNIRS signals. Furthermore, no previous work on the automatic detection
  of fear responses using fNIRS data exists. The literature indicates that a combination
  of VR and fNIRS technology is feasible and that it allows for experiments with greater
  ecological validity than traditional lab experiments. An experiment was conducted
  during which participants with moderate fear of heights (experimental group, n=15)
  and participants with no to little fear of heights (control group, n=14) were exposed
  to VR scenarios involving heights (height condition) and no heights (ground condition).
  During the experiment, the participants' fNIRS signals were recorded. As an additional
  measurement, the heart rate (HR) of every participant was extracted from the fNIRS
  signals. Permutation tests were used to perform between-group statistical analyses
  and within-group statistical analyses (for the experimental group) on the fNIRS
  data and HR data. Furthermore, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Support Vector
  Machines (SVM) were used to train and test subject-dependent classifiers and subject-independent
  classifiers on the data of the significant fNIRS channels of the experimental group,
  in order to detect fear responses. The between-group statistical analyses show that
  the fNIRS data of the control group and the experimental group are only significantly
  different in channel 3, where the grand average ?[HbO] contrast signal of the experimental
  group exceeds that of the control group. Furthermore, the HR data of both groups
  are not significantly different. The within-group statistical analyses show that
  there are significant differences between the grand average ?[HbO] values during
  fear responses and those during no-fear responses, where the ?[HbO] values of the
  fear responses were significantly higher than those of the no-fear responses in
  the channels located towards the frontal part of the pre-frontal cortex. Also, channel
  23 was found to be significant for the grand average ?[HbR] signals. No significant
  differences were found between the HR data during fear responses or no fear responses
  of the experimental group. The subject-dependent SVM classifier using 1-second history
  of the fNIRS signals can detect fear responses at an average accuracy of 72.47%
  (SD 20.61). The subject-independent SVM classifier using 5-second history of the
  fNIRS signals can detect fear responses at an average accuracy of 77.29% (SD 10.64).
  The subject-independent classifiers show potential for usage in online detection
  scenarios, as they can be trained beforehand on existing fNIRS data and can classify
  the unseen data of a new person at an average accuracy above 75%.
