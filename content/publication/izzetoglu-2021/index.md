abstract: Cerebral tissue oximetry (CTO) based on near-infrared spectroscopy provides
  clinically relevant information on tissue perfusion and has been used specifically
  in infant monitoring and during cardiac surgeries. With different sensor designs
  in the selection and configuration of light sources and detectors and implemented
  analysis algorithms in tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) extraction, substantial differences
  were observed between different commercially available CTO device measurements.
  Tissue models (phantoms) mimicking a human head both optically and anatomically
  provide the controllable, safe, universally agreeable, and reproducible environment
  for the evaluation of CTO device performances. In this article, we implemented our
  realistic and dynamic multilayer mixed solid and liquid phantom design with controlled
  and repeatable test procedures in the evaluation of multiple commercially available
  CTO devices. Performances were evaluated for each CTO device within themselves,
  across each other and a reference device simultaneously under continuously changing
  oxygen saturation conditions. Results indicated the feasibility of our phantoms
  in CTO device performance testing and suggested that in general, CTO device measurements
  were very precise ( S_ res < 1.48 %) and highly correlated ( R^2 > 0.89 and p <
  0.0001 ) but had varying levels of accuracy, sensitivity, static, and proportional
  bias ( 15.4%< A_ rms < 21.1 %, 0.31 < sensitivity (regression slope) <0.43, and
  35.94< bias (regression intercept) <49.74). In addition, gauge repeatability and
  reproducibility (Gauge R&R) analysis provided that most of the CTO devices were
  within acceptable ranges with precision-to-tolerance (P/T) ratio <10%, a number
  of distinct categories (NDC) >5, and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) >80%.
