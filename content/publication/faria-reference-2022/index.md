abstract: Abstract  Objective. To establish the reference values for peripheral tissue
  perfusion of the triceps surae muscle assessed by Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)
  at rest and in progressive effort. Approach. A total of 288 apparently healthy individuals
  of both sexes were included; between 30 and 79 years of age; nonsmokers; without
  diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, systemic arterial hypertension, kidney disease,
  symptoms of angina and intermittent claudication, or any musculoskeletal alteration
  that would prevent physical exertion; and without diagnosis of Peripheral arterial
  disease (PAD) or other associated symptoms. All individuals performed anthropometric
  measurements, physical activity levels, and tissue oxygen saturation (StO 2 ) assessments
  by NIRS during and after arterial occlusion maneuver and incremental shuttle walking
  test. The variables obtained by NIRS were presented in percentiles (P) for general
  comparison between sexes and for comparison between sexes according to age group.
  The relationship between the NIRS data and other variables was tested. Main results.
  Considering P50 and ptextless0.05, men had lower StO2 values, higher deoxygenation
  and reoxygenation (Tx-reox) rates at rest, and higher Tx-reox during progressive
  effort. There were correlations (ptextless0.0001) of body composition with the lowest
  StO2 and Tx-reox values and of functional capacity with Tx-reox in occlusion and
  Tx-reox. Significance. The percentiles presented can clinically assist in the diagnosis
  and monitoring of different health conditions; however, it is important to consider
  the individual’s sex, body composition, and functional capacity.
