abstract: Near Infrared Spectroscopy is a method that measures the brain's haemodynamic
  response. It is of interest in brain-computer interfaces where haemodynamic patterns
  in motor tasks are exploited to detect movement. However, the NIRS signal is usually
  corrupted with background biological processes, some of which are periodic or quasi-periodic
  in nature. Singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is a time-series decomposition method
  which separates a signal into a trend, oscillatory components and noise with minimal
  prior assumptions about their nature. Due to the frequency spectrum overlap of the
  movement response and of background processes such as Mayer waves, spectral filters
  are usually suboptimal. In this study, we perform SSA both in an online and a block
  fashion resulting in the removal of periodic components and in increased classification
  performance. Our study indicates that SSA is a practical method that can replace
  spectral filtering and is evaluated on healthy participants and patients with tetraplegia.
