abstract: "The modified Oxford maneuver is the reference standard for assessing arterial\
  \ baroreflex function. The maneuver comprises a systemic bolus injection of 100\
  \ $\u03BC$g sodium nitroprusside (SNP) followed by 150 $\u03BC$g phenylephrine (PE).\
  \ On the one hand, this results in an increase in oxyhemoglobin and total hemoglobin\
  \ followed by a decrease within the cerebral sample volume illuminated by near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy (NIRS). On the other hand, it produces a decrease in cerebral blood\
  \ flow velocity (CBFv) within the middle cerebral artery (MCA) during SNP and an\
  \ increase in CBFv during PE as measured by transcranial Doppler ultrasound. To\
  \ resolve this apparent discrepancy, we hypothesized that SNP dilates, whereas PE\
  \ constricts, the MCA. We combined transcranial Doppler ultrasound of the right\
  \ MCA with NIRS illuminating the right frontal cortex in 12 supine healthy subjects\
  \ 18-24 yr old. Assuming constant O2 consumption and venous saturation, as estimated\
  \ by partial venous occlusion plethysmography, we used conservation of mass (continuity)\
  \ equations to estimate the changes in arterial inflow ($\u0394$Qa) and venous outflow\
  \ ($\u0394$Qv) of the NIRS-illuminated area. Oxyhemoglobin and total hemoglobin,\
  \ respectively, increased by 13.6 \xB1 1.6 and 15.2 \xB1 1.4 $\u03BC$mol/kg brain\
  \ tissue with SNP despite hypotension and decreased by 6 \xB1 1 and 7 \xB1 1 $\u03BC\
  $mol/kg with PE despite hypertension. SNP increased $\u0394$Qa by 0.36 \xB1.03 $\u03BC\
  $mol\u02D9kg-1\u02D9s-1 (21.6 $\u03BC$mol\u02D9kg-1\u02D9min-1), whereas CBFv decreased\
  \ from 71 \xB1 2 to 62 \xB1 2 cm/s. PE decreased $\u0394$Qa by 0.27 \xB1.2 $\u03BC\
  $mol\u02D9kg-1\u02D9s-1 (16.2 $\u03BC$mol\u02D9kg-1\u02D9min-1), whereas CBFv increased\
  \ to 75 \xB1 3 cm/s. These results are consistent with dilation of the MCA by SNP\
  \ and constriction by PE. \xA9 2013 the American Physiological Society."
