abstract: The microvasculature is important for both health and exercise tolerance
  in a range of populations. However, methodological limitations have meant changes
  in micro- vascular blood flow are rarely assessed in humans during interventions
  designed to affect skeletal muscle blood flow such as the wearing of compression
  garments. The aim of this study is, for the first time, to use contrast- enhanced
  ultrasound to directly measure the effects of compression on muscle microvascular
  blood flow alongside measures of femoral artery blood flow and muscle oxygenation
  following intense exercise in healthy adults. It was hypothesized that both muscle
  microvascular and femoral artery blood flows would be augmented with compression
  garments as com- pared with a control condition. Ten recreationally active participants
  completed two repeated- sprint exercise sessions, with and without lower- limb compression
  tights. Muscle microvascular blood flow, femoral arterial blood flow (2D and Doppler
  ul- trasound), muscle oxygenation (near- infrared spectroscopy), cycling performance,
  and venous blood samples were measured/taken throughout exercise and the 1- hour
  post- exercise recovery period. Compared with control, compression reduced mus-
  cle microvascular blood volume and attenuated the exercise- induced increase in
  mi- crovascular velocity and flow immediately after exercise and 1 hour post- exercise.
  Compression increased femoral artery diameter and augmented the exercise- induced
  increase in femoral arterial blood flow during exercise. Markers of blood oxygen
  extraction in muscle were increased with compression during and after exercise.
  Compression had no effect on blood lactate, glucose, or exercise performance. We
  provide new evidence that lower- limb compression attenuates the exercise- induced
  increase in skeletal muscle microvascular blood flow following exercise, despite
  a divergent increase in femoral artery blood flow. Decreased muscle microvascular
  perfusion is offset by increased muscle oxygen extraction, a potential mechanism
  al- lowing for the maintenance of exercise performance.
