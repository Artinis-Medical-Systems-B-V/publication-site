abstract: "Objective: High-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS)\
  \ using a 4 \xD7 1 electrode montage has been previously shown using modeling and\
  \ physiological studies to constrain the electric field within the spatial extent\
  \ of the electrodes. The aim of this proof-of-concept study was to determine if\
  \ functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging can be used to determine\
  \ a hemodynamic correlate of this 4 \xD7 1 HD-tDCS electric field on the brain.\
  \ Materials and Methods: In a three session cross-over study design, 13 healthy\
  \ males received one sham (2 mA, 30 sec) and two real (HD-tDCS-1 and HD-tDCS-2,\
  \ 2 mA, 10 min) anodal HD-tDCS targeting the left M1 via a 4 \xD7 1 electrode montage\
  \ (anode on C3 and 4 return electrodes 3.5 cm from anode). The two real HD-tDCS\
  \ sessions afforded a within-subject replication of the findings. fNIRS was used\
  \ to measure changes in brain hemodynamics (oxygenated hemoglobin integral-O2Hbint)\
  \ during each 10 min session from two regions of interest (ROIs) in the stimulated\
  \ left hemisphere that corresponded to \u201Cwithin\u201D (Lin) and \u201Coutside\u201D\
  \ (Lout) the spatial extent of the 4 \xD7 1 electrode montage, and two corresponding\
  \ ROIs (Rin and Rout) in the right hemisphere. Results: The ANOVA showed that both\
  \ real anodal HD-tDCS compared to sham induced a significantly greater O2Hbint in\
  \ the Lin than Lout ROIs of the stimulated left hemisphere; while there were no\
  \ significant differences between the real and sham sessions for the right hemisphere\
  \ ROIs. Intra-class correlation coefficients showed \u201Cfair-to-good\u201D reproducibility\
  \ for the left stimulated hemisphere ROIs. Conclusions: The greater O2Hbint \u201C\
  within\u201D than \u201Coutside\u201D the spatial extent of the 4 \xD7 1 electrode\
  \ montage represents a hemodynamic correlate of the electrical field distribution,\
  \ and thus provides a prospective reliable method to determine the dose of stimulation\
  \ that is necessary to optimize HD-tDCS parameters in various applications."
