abstract: 'The aim of this study was to assess the effects of oxygen availability
  (normoxia vs. hypoxia), muscle mass and exercise type on pulse oxygen saturation,
  and quadriceps muscle oxygenation during repeated sprint exercises. Sixteen healthy
  participants completed 5 mathematical equation 12 s sprints (21 s rest). This sprint-like
  exercise was performed under two environmental conditions (normoxia: FiO2 = 21%;
  systemic hypoxia: FiO2 = 13%) and for three exercise modalities: unilateral knee
  extensions (KE) involving the right leg extensors (UNI), bilateral KE involving
  both legs extensors (BIL), and bilateral leg cycling (CYC). Measurements included
  power output, pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2), and vastus lateralis oxygenation (delta
  in tissue saturation index; ΔTSI). In hypoxia, a similar minimal SpO2 was reported
  in UNI and BIL but SpO2 was lower in CYC (p = 0.047 and p = 0.021). ΔTSI during
  sprints and recoveries were similar in UNI and BIL but greater in CYC (p textless
  0.001) and in normoxia compared to hypoxia (main condition effect; p = 0.002). The
  power output was lower during KE exercises than during cycling, and no effect of
  hypoxia has been reported. The main results of this study indicate that unilateral
  and bilateral KE at high intensity induce comparable pulse and local muscular desaturation
  in hypoxia, and that these alterations are exacerbated during cycling.'
