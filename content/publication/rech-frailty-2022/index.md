abstract: 'Introduction Frailty is highly prevalent in heart failure (HF) patients.
  HF is associated with oxidative stress and chronic inflammation, which impair oxygen
  use by skeletal muscles. Little is known about the influence of frailty on vascular
  responsiveness and tissue oxygenation.  Objective Analyze the influence of frailty
  on vascular responsiveness and muscle oxygenation in elderly individuals with and
  without HF.  Methods Individuals aged ≥60 years, with or without HF, were evaluated
  for frailty (phenotype). Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to assess muscle
  oxygenation at rest (oxygen saturation – StO2 and deoxyhemoglobin) and during handgrip
  exercise (minimum StO2 and maximum deoxyhemoglobin), and oxygenation variables.  Statistical
  analysis Results were grouped according to the frailty phenotype: non-frail, pre-frail,
  and frail. Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess normality. Data were compared using
  a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Bonferroni post hoc test was applied to
  determine the influence of frailty or HF on NIRS variables. SPSS software was used
  in the analyses; p textless 0.05 was considered significant.  Results 55 elderly
  participants (61.8% female; 70.4 ± 7.2 years old; 28 HF patients) participated in
  the study. 32.7% (n = 18) were classified as non-frail, 43.3% (n = 24) as pre-frail,
  and 23.6% (n = 13) as frail. The analysis of vascular responsiveness (n = 52) identified
  an influence (p textless 0.05) of frailty on the reperfusion rate (slope 2 and ∆StO2
  of nadir-peak) and desaturation during occlusion (area under the curve of StO2)
  in HF patients. There was no influence of frailty or HF on muscle oxygenation at
  rest and during exercise (n = 54; p textgreater 0.05).  Conclusion The coexistence
  of frailty and HF seems to impair vascular responsiveness, as frail elderly participants
  with HF presented lower reperfusion rates and higher desaturation levels during
  the arterial occlusion test. However, the presence of frailty or HF alone had no
  influence on muscle oxygenation at rest or during exercise.'
