abstract: 'Abstract  Purpose To determine the effects of load carriage in normoxia
  and normobaric hypoxia on ventilatory responses, hemodynamics, tissue oxygenation,
  and metabolism.   Methods  Healthy males (n = 12) completed 3 randomly ordered baseline
  graded exercise tests in the following conditions: (1) unloaded normoxic (U: F I
  O 2 = 20.93%), (2) loaded (~ 30 kg) normoxic (LN), and (3) loaded hypoxic simulating ~ 3650 m
  (LH: F I O 2 =  ~ 13%). Thereafter, experimental exercise trials were completed
  in quasi-randomized order (i.e., U completed first) consisting of 3 × 10 min of
  walking (separated by 5 min seated rest) with stages matched with the U condition
  (in ascending order) for relative intensity, absolute oxygen consumption ([VO 2
  ]; 1.7 L min −1 ), and walking speed (1.45 ± 0.15 m s −1 ).    Results  Load carriage
  increased perceived exertion and reduced VO 2max (LN: − 7%; LH: − 32%; p textless 0.05).
  At matched VO 2 , stroke volume and tidal volume were reduced and maintained with
  LN and LH vs. U, respectively ( p textless 0.05). Increases in cardiac output and
  minute ventilation at matched VO 2 (with LH) and speed (with LN and LH), were primarily
  accomplished via increases in heart rate and breathing frequency ( p textless 0.05).
  Cerebral oxygenated hemoglobin (O 2 HHb) was increased at all intensities with LN,
  but deoxygenated hemoglobin and total hemoglobin were increased with LH ( p textless 0.05).
  Muscle oxygen kinetics and substrate utilization were similar between LN and U,
  but LH increased CHO dependence and reduced muscle O 2 HHb at matched speed ( p
  textless 0.05).    Conclusion Load carriage reduces cardiorespiratory efficiency
  and increases physiological strain, particularly in hypoxic environments. Potential
  load carriage-induced alterations in cerebral blood flow may increase the risk for
  altitude illnesses and requires further study.'
