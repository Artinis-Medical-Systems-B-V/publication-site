abstract: "Although severe intermittent hypoxi Although severe intermittent hypoxia\
  \ (IH) is well known to induce deleterious cardiometabolic consequences, moderate\
  \ IH may induce positive effects in obese individuals. The present study aimed to\
  \ evaluate the effect of two hypoxic conditioning programs on cardiovascular and\
  \ metabolic health status of overweight or obese individuals. In this randomized\
  \ single-blind controlled study, 35 subjects (54 \xB1 9.3 yr, 31.7 \xB1 3.5 kg/m2)\
  \ were randomized into three 8-wk interventions (three 1-h sessions per week): sustained\
  \ hypoxia (SH), arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) = 75%; IH, 5 min SpO2 = 75% \u2013\
  \ 3 min normoxia; normoxia. Ventilation, heart rate, blood pressure, and tissue\
  \ oxygenation were measured during the first and last hypoxic conditioning sessions.\
  \ Vascular function, blood glucose and insulin, lipid profile, nitric oxide metabolites,\
  \ and oxidative stress were evaluated before and after the interventions. Both SH\
  \ and IH increased ventilation in hypoxia (+1.8 \xB1 2.1 and +2.3 \xB1 3.6 L/min,\
  \ respectively; P < 0.05) and reduced normoxic diastolic blood pressure (-12 \xB1\
  \ 15 and -13 \xB1 10 mmHg, respectively; P < 0.05), whereas changes in normoxic\
  \ systolic blood pressure were not significant (+3 \xB1 9 and -6 \xB1 13 mmHg, respectively;\
  \ P > 0.05). IH only reduced heart rate variability (e.g., root-mean-square difference\
  \ of successive normal R-R intervals in normoxia -21 \xB1 35%; P < 0.05). Both SH\
  \ and IH induced no significant change in body mass index, vascular function, blood\
  \ glucose, insulin and lipid profile, nitric oxide metabolites, or oxidative stress,\
  \ except for an increase in superoxide dismutase activity following SH. This study\
  \ indicates that passive hypoxic conditioning in obese individuals induces some\
  \ positive cardiovascular and respiratory improvements despite no change in anthropometric\
  \ data and even a reduction in heart rate variability during IH exposure."
