abstract: "When healthy subjects stand up, it is associated with a reduction in cerebral\
  \ blood velocity and oxygenation although cerebral autoregulation would be considered\
  \ to prevent a decrease in cerebral perfusion. Aging is associated with a higher\
  \ incidence of falls, and in the elderly falls may occur particularly during the\
  \ adaptation to postural change. This study evaluated the cerebrovascular adaptation\
  \ to postural change in 15 healthy younger (YNG) vs. 15 older (OLD) subjects by\
  \ recordings of the near-infrared spectroscopy-determined cerebral oxygenation (cO2Hb)\
  \ and the transcranial Doppler-determined mean middle cerebral artery blood velocity\
  \ (MCA Vmean). In OLD (59 (52-65) years) vs. YNG (29 (27-33) years), the initial\
  \ postural decline in mean arterial pressure (-52\xB13% vs. -67\xB13%), cO2Hb (-3.4\xB1\
  2.5$\u03BC$moll-1 vs. -5.3\xB11.7$\u03BC$moll-1) and MCA Vmean (-16\xB14% vs. -29\xB1\
  3%) was smaller. The decline in MCA Vmean was related to the reduction in MAP. During\
  \ prolonged orthostatic stress, the decline in MCA Vmeanand cO2Hb in OLD remained\
  \ smaller. We conclude that with healthy aging the postural reduction in cerebral\
  \ perfusion becomes less prominent. \xA9 2009 Elsevier Inc."
