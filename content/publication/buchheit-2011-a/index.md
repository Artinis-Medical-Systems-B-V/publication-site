abstract: "The purpose of this study was to assess the reliability of postexercise\
  \ near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-derived measurements and their sensitivity to\
  \ different exercise intensities in the field. Seventeen athletes (24\u02D91\xB1\
  5\u02D96year) repeated, on three occasions, two 2-min submaximal shuttle-runs at\
  \ 40% and 60% of V IFT (final speed of the 30-15 intermittent fitness test) and\
  \ a 50-m shuttle-run sprint (Sprint), with (OCC) or without (CON) repeated transient\
  \ arterial occlusions of the medial gastrocnemius during the postexercise period.\
  \ NIRS variables (i.e. oxyhaemoglobin [HbO 2], deoxyhaemoglobin [HHb] and their\
  \ difference [Hb diff]) were measured continuously for 3min after each exercise.\
  \ Half-recovery (1/2Rec) and mean response (MRT; monoexponential curve fitting)\
  \ times of muscle reoxygenation and muscle oxygen uptake recovery were calculated.\
  \ Reliability was assessed using the typical error of measurement, expressed as\
  \ a coefficient of variation (CV). Postexercise recovery of muscle reoxygenation\
  \ revealed CVs ranging from 16\u02D98% to 37\u02D93%; CV for recovery ranged from\
  \ 6\u02D92% to 20\u02D99%, with no substantial differences shown between NIRS variables\
  \ and exercise intensities. While running, intensity did not affect MRT or 1/2Rec\
  \ for muscle reoxygenation, and differences were found for recovery (e.g. [Hb diff]-\
  \ MRT=28\u02D97\xB15\u02D92, 34\u02D92\xB15\u02D91 and 37\u02D93\xB16\u02D92s for\
  \ 40%, 60% and Sprint, respectively, P<0\u02D901). To conclude, the kinetics of\
  \ postexercise NIRS measurements showed CV values ranging from 6% to 37%, with no\
  \ substantial differences between exercise intensities or NIRS-derived variables.\
  \ However, exercise intensity did influence recovery kinetics, but not that of muscle\
  \ reoxygenation in an occlusion-free condition. \xA9 2011 The Authors. Clinical\
