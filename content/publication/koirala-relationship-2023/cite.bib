 abstract = {A linear relationship between skeletal muscle venous (C
T

) and oxygenated (ΔHbMbO
2,N
) or deoxygenated (ΔHHbMb
N
) near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) signal suggests a main Hb contribution to the NIRS signal. However, experimental, and computational evidence supports a significant contribution of Mb to the NIRS. Venous and NIRS measurements from a canine model of muscle oxidative metabolism (Med. Sci. Sports Exerc. 48(10):2013-2020, 2016) were integrated into a computational model of muscle O

transport and utilization to evaluate whether the relationship between venous and NIRS oxygenation can be affected by a significant Mb contribution to the NIRS signals. The mathematical model predicted well the measure of the changes of C
T

and NIRS signals for different O

delivery (blood flow, arterial O

content) in muscle at rest (T1, T2) and during contraction (T3). Furthermore, computational analysis indicates that for adequate O

delivery, Mb contribution to NIRS signals was significant (20-30%) even in presence of a linear C
T
ven
-NIRS relationship; for a reduced O
2
delivery the non-linearity of the C
T
ven
-NIRS relationship was related to the Mb contribution (50%). In this case (T3), the deviation from linearity is observed when O
