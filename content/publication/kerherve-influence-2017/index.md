abstract: "Purpose. The physiological mechanisms for alterations in oxygen utilization\
  \ (V\u02D9O2) and the energy cost of running (Cr) during prolonged running are not\
  \ completely understood, and could be linked with alterations in muscle and cerebral\
  \ tissue oxygenation. Methods. Eight trained ultramarathon runners (three women;\
  \ mean \xB1 SD; age 37 \xB1 7 yr; maximum V\u02D9O2 60 \xB1 15 mL min-1 kg-1) completed\
  \ a 6 hr treadmill run (6TR), which consisted of four modules, including periods\
  \ of moderate (3 min at 10 km h-1, 10-CR) and heavy exercise intensities (6 min\
  \ at 70% of maximum VO2, HILL), separated by three, 100 min periods of self-paced\
  \ running (SP). We measured V\u02D9O2, minute ventilation (V\u02D9E), ventilatory\
  \ efficiency (V\u02D9E:VO2), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), Cr, muscle and cerebral\
  \ tissue saturation index (TSI) during the modules, and heart rate (HR) and perceived\
  \ exertion (RPE) during the modules and SP. Results. Participants ran 58.3 \xB1\
  \ 10.5 km during 6TR. Speed decreased and HR and RPE increased during SP. Across\
  \ the modules, HR and V\u02D9O2 increased (10-CR), and RER decreased (10-CR and\
  \ HILL). There were no significant changes in V\u02D9E, V\u02D9E:V\u02D9O2, Cr,\
  \ TSI and RPE across the modules. Conclusions. In the context of positive pacing\
  \ (decreasing speed), increased cardiac drift and perceived exertion over the 6TR,\
  \ we observed increased RER and increased HR at moderate and heavy exercise intensity,\
  \ increased V\u02D9O2 at moderate intensity, and no effect of exercise duration\
  \ on ventilatory efficiency, energy cost of running and tissue oxygenation."
