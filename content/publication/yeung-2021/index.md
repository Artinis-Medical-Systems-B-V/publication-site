abstract: "Despite decades of research, our understanding of functional brain development\
  \ throughout childhood and adolescence remains limited due to the challenges posed\
  \ by certain neuroimaging modalities. Recently, there has been a growing interest\
  \ in using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to elucidate the neural\
  \ basis of cognitive and socioemotional development and identify the factors shaping\
  \ these types of development. This article, focusing on the fNIRS methods, presents\
  \ an up-to-date systematic review of fNIRS studies addressing the effects of age\
  \ and other factors on brain functions in children and adolescents. Literature searches\
  \ were conducted using PubMed and PsycINFO. A total of 79 fNIRS studies involving\
  \ healthy individuals aged 3\u201317 years that were published in peer-reviewed\
  \ journals in English before July 2020 were included. Six methodological aspects\
  \ of these studies were evaluated, including the research design, experimental paradigm,\
  \ fNIRS measurement, data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and result presentation.\
  \ The risk of bias, such as selective outcome reporting, was assessed throughout\
  \ the review. A qualitative synthesis of study findings in terms of the factor effects\
  \ on changes in oxyhemoglobin concentration was also performed. This unregistered\
  \ review highlights the strengths and limitations of the existing literature and\
  \ suggests directions for future research to facilitate the improved use of fNIRS\
  \ in developmental cognitive neuroscience research."
