abstract: 'The onset of menopause and accompanying changes to ovarian hormones often
  precedes endothelial dysfunction in women. In particular, accelerated impairments
  in macrovascular and microvascular function coincides with the loss of estrogen,
  as does impaired endothelial responses to ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. In healthy,
  early postmenopausal women (n=12; 3.9 Â± 1.5 years since menopause) we tested the
  hypothesis that acute dietary nitrate (NO3-) supplementation would improve endothelial
  function and attenuate the magnitude of endothelial dysfunction following whole-arm
  IR in comparison to placebo. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
  crossover study we tested participants before and after NO3--rich (BRnitrate) and
  NO3--depleted (BRplacebo) beetroot juice consumption, as well as following IR injury,
  and 15 minutes after IR to assess recovery. Analyses with repeated measures general
  linear models revealed a condition*time interaction for brachial artery flow-mediated
  dilation (FMD; p=0.04), and no interaction effect was found for the NIRS-derived
  reperfusion slope (p=0.86). Follow up analysis showed a significant decline in FMD
  following IR injury with BRplacebo in comparison to all other timepoints (all, ptextless0.05),
  whilst this decline was not present with BRnitrate (all, ptextgreater0.05). Our
  findings demonstrate that a single dose of dietary NO3- minimizes IR-induced macrovascular
  endothelial dysfunction in healthy, early postmenopausal women, but does not improve
  resting macrovascular and microvascular function.  Novelty:  -In healthy, early
  postmenopausal women, a single dose of NO3--rich beetroot juice can protect against
  IR-induced endothelial dysfunction  -This protection may be due to NO bioactivity
  during IR rather than improved endothelial function prior to IR'
