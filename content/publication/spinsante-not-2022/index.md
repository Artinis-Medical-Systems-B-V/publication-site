abstract: Quantified-self sleep tracking devices such as Fitbit are gaining great
  popular in recent years. However, users often complain about the discrepancy between
  the data collected with sleep trackers and their subjective sleep experience, which
  is often attributed to the accuracy issue of the devices. In this pilot study, we
  aim to provide an explanation to such discrepancy from a neuroscience perspective.
  We investigated the associations of subjective sleep rating and Fitbit measured
  sleep data to cortical hemodynamics in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during the first
  sleep cycle. Correlation analysis results showed that subjective sleep rating mainly
  correlated to the median of the concentration changes in oxyhemoglobin (ΔO2Hb) and
  deoxyhemoglobin (ΔHHb) in a set of channels, with positive correlation coefficients.
  In contrast, the sleep score computed by Fitbit mainly correlated to the mean of
  the ΔO2Hb and ΔHHb in a different set of channels, with negative correlation coefficients.
  The findings suggested that better perceived sleep quality may be positively associated
  to increased hemodynamics during the first sleep cycle, and the opposite may be
  true for objective sleep metrics such as sleep score measured by Fitbit. The result
  implies that users’ subjective perception of sleep and the sleep tracking devices
  may be capturing different dimensions of sleep. As such, improving device accuracy
  may help little in addressing the discrepancy between the subjective sleep experience
  and the objective data. The findings provided design implications for the development
  of future sleep tracking technologies.
