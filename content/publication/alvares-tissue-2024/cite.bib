 abstract = {Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined with vascular occlusion test (NIRS-VOT) is a reactive hyperemia technique for in vivo evaluation of skeletal muscle microvascular reactivity. Previous studies using NIRS-VOT have been shown to be able to detect impairments in microvascular function in high-risk cardiovascular disease (CVD) populations such as older individuals. It has been demonstrated that older individuals have slower reactive hyperemia compared to young individuals. Importantly, older individuals also show less desaturation during ischemia compared to young. Based on these findings, it has been suggested that the slower reactive hyperemia observed in older individuals is explained by the lower desaturation during blood flow occlusion (reduced ischemic stimulus). This retrospective analysis compared reactive hyperemia in 36 young and 47 older tissue desaturation-matched individuals that underwent 5-min blood flow occlusion. Overall, we showed that older individuals have impaired reactive hyperemia compared to young when matching for the degree of desaturation and blood flow occlusion time. These findings provide evidence that lower tissue desaturation during ischemia is not a major determinant of impaired reactive hyperemia in older individuals.},
