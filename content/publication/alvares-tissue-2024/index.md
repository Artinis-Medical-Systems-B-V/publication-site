abstract: Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined with vascular occlusion test
  (NIRS-VOT) is a reactive hyperemia technique for in vivo evaluation of skeletal
  muscle microvascular reactivity. Previous studies using NIRS-VOT have been shown
  to be able to detect impairments in microvascular function in high-risk cardiovascular
  disease (CVD) populations such as older individuals. It has been demonstrated that
  older individuals have slower reactive hyperemia compared to young individuals.
  Importantly, older individuals also show less desaturation during ischemia compared
  to young. Based on these findings, it has been suggested that the slower reactive
  hyperemia observed in older individuals is explained by the lower desaturation during
  blood flow occlusion (reduced ischemic stimulus). This retrospective analysis compared
  reactive hyperemia in 36 young and 47 older tissue desaturation-matched individuals
  that underwent 5-min blood flow occlusion. Overall, we showed that older individuals
  have impaired reactive hyperemia compared to young when matching for the degree
  of desaturation and blood flow occlusion time. These findings provide evidence that
  lower tissue desaturation during ischemia is not a major determinant of impaired
  reactive hyperemia in older individuals.
