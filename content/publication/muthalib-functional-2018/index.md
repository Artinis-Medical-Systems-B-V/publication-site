abstract: "This study used non-invasive functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)\
  \ neuroimaging to monitor bilateral sensorimotor region activation during unilateral\
  \ voluntary (VOL) and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES)-evoked movements.\
  \ Methods. In eight healthy male volunteers, fNIRS was used to measure relative\
  \ changes in oxyhaemoglobin (O2Hb) and deoxyhaemoglobin (HHb) concentrations from\
  \ a cortical sensorimotor region of interest in the left (LH) and right (RH) hemispheres\
  \ during NMES-evoked and VOL wrist extension movements of the right arm. Results.\
  \ NMES-evoked movements induced significantly greater activation (increase in O2Hb\
  \ and concomitant decrease in HHb) in the contralateral LH than in the ipsilateral\
  \ RH (O2Hb: 0\u02D944\_\xB1\_0\u02D916\_$\u03BC$M and 0\u02D925\_\xB1\_0\u02D922\_\
  $\u03BC$M, P\_=\_0\u02D9017; HHb: \u22120\u02D919\_\xB1\_0\u02D910\_$\u03BC$M and\
  \ \u22120\u02D912\_\xB1\_0\u02D909\_$\u03BC$M, P\_=\_0\u02D9036, respectively) as\
  \ did VOL movements (0\u02D951\_\xB1\_0\u02D924 $\u03BC$\u039C and 0\u02D934\_\xB1\
  \_0\u02D921\_$\u03BC$M, P\_=\_0\u02D9031; HHb: \u22120\u02D918\_\xB1\_0\u02D907\
  \ $\u03BC$\u039C and \u22120\u02D912\_\xB1\_0\u02D904 $\u03BC$\u039C, P\_=\_0\u02D9\
  05, respectively). There was no significant difference between conditions for O2Hb\
  \ (P\_=\_0\u02D9144) and HHb (P\_=\_0\u02D9958). Conclusion. fNIRS neuroimaging\
  \ enables quantification of bilateral sensorimotor regional activation profiles\
  \ during voluntary and NMES-evoked wrist extension movements."
