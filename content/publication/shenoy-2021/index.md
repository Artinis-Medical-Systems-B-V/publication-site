abstract: 'Several neuroimaging studies have examined the effect of different types
  and combinations of exercises on activation of brain associated with cognitive testing
  but none of these studies have examined the role of high intensity intermittent
  exercise (HIIE) in altering cortical activation from simple to complex cognitive
  tasks. The purpose of this study was to find if HIIE has a role in modulating executive
  functions related to inhibitory control as expressed by changes in prefrontal cortex
  (PFC) activation. Materials and methods. 40 healthy adults aged between 18-30 years
  volunteered for the study. They were randomly divided into HIIE a (n = 20) group
  and a control (n = 20) group. The HIIE group performed 4*4 min of high intensity
  exercise on a cycle ergometer with 3 minutes of active recovery at lower intensities
  between the bouts, whereas the control group performed no exercise. Prefrontal hemodynamics
  (oxy and deoxy haemoglobin) were assessed using functional near infrared spectroscopy
  (fNIRS) during the Colour Word Stroop test (CWST) on two sessions: pre-session and
  post-session (1 week after pre-session). Results. The results indicate a significant
  difference in CWST scores which coincided with a significant difference in hemodynamics
  of PFC between a congruent and a complex incongruent task in the HIIE group. There
  was a greater activation of the right frontopolar area, the left ventrolateral prefrontal
  cortex, and the left frontopolar area during the incongruent task in response to
  acute HIIE. Conclusion. HIIE plays a role in changing brain activation during more
  complex interference related tasks.'
