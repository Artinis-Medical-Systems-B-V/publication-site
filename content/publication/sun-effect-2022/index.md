abstract: Background Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common developmental
  disorder in childhood, with a 5%-6% worldwide prevalence. Children with ADHD often
  demonstrate impaired executive function, which is closely related to the development
  of the commonly observed behavioral problems such as inattention, impaired inhibition,
  and hyperactivity. The purpose of this study is to examine whether a game-based
  high-intensity interval training (HIIT) program can improve the executive function
  of children with ADHD, compared with a traditional structured aerobic exercise program
  and a non-treatment control group.   Methods/Design A total of 42 children with
  ADHD will be recruited to participate in this three-arm school-based randomized
  controlled trial. An 8-week specially designed game-based HIIT (GameHIIT) program
  and a traditional game-based structured aerobic exercise (GameSAE) program will
  be delivered to those children randomly assigned to these two intervention groups,
  while the children in the control group will maintain their regular physical activity
  over the same period. A number of outcome measures including executive function,
  cerebral hemodynamic response, physical activity, physical fitness, and enjoyment
  and adherence to the intervention will be assessed for both groups at baseline (T0),
  immediately after the intervention period (T1), and after the follow-up period (T2).   Discussion
  HIIT has recently emerged as a feasible and efficacious strategy for increasing
  physical health outcomes and cognitive function, including executive function, in
  healthy young people. However, research has yet to investigate whether the executive
  function of children with ADHD can be effectively enhanced through HIIT. If, as
  hypothesized, GameHIIT program improves outcomes for children with ADHD, the present
  research will inform the development of targeted exercise programs that can be more
  broadly used with this particular population.
