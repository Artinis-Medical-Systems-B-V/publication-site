abstract: 'Introduction Moving in real environments requires to consider not only
  ecological motor tasks (e.g., curvilinear walking), but also the cognitive load
  associated with the motor performance [1,2]. Wearable technology provides non-invasive
  monitoring solutions for both aspects, through inertial sensors and functional Near-Infrared
  Spectroscopy (fNIRS) technique. Specifically, fNIRS assesses cortical activity through
  the hemodynamic response of the brain [3] and can be performed while the participant
  freely moves in the environment [3,4]. In this context, the prefrontal cortex (PFC)
  is of particular interest: it regulates executive functions and has the potential
  to reveal crucial information related to cognitive processes and dynamic gait indices
  [1,3,4]. While it is well known that different motor tasks are characterized by
  different PFC activations, it is not clearly understood how PFC activation changes
  with increased complexity of balance locomotion tasks yet. Therefore, the study
  aims at filling this gap investigating motor-cognitive interference in balance and
  gait tasks of increasing difficulty.  Methods Twenty healthy young adults (11 females,
  24.4±2.7 years) randomly performed four different motor tasks of 60 s each related
  to dynamic (linear walking, LW, and tandem walking, TW) and static (doubleleg stance,
  DLS, and single-leg stance, SLS) balance while wearing: i) a fNIRS brain cap (Brite
  24, Artinis, The Netherlands) to measure the PFC changes in oxygenated hemoglobin
  (ΔO2Hb), and ii) 4 synchronized measurement units (IMUs, Opal, APDM, USA) at sternum,
  pelvis and both lateral malleoli to quantify gait and balance motor patterns. Repeated
  measures ANOVA (ΔO2Hb) and t-tests (IMUs) were computed to investigate differences
  among tasks.  Results fNIRS (top panel) and IMUs (bottom panels) results are displayed
  in Fig. 1.  Discussion As expected, more challenging motor tasks (TW and SLS) require
  greater PFC activation, suggesting the use of additional attentional resources during
  tasks of increased difficulty. In addition, motor performance suffers of tasks complexity,
  as clearly emerge from dynamic gait indices and postural parameters. This study
  lays foundation for better understanding the motor-cognitive interference in ecological
  gait and balance tasks.'
