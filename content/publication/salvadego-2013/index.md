abstract: "Oxidative function during exercise was evaluated in 11 young athletes with\
  \ marked skeletal muscle hypertrophy induced by long-term resistance training (RTA;\
  \ body mass 102.6 \xB1 7.3 kg, mean \xB1 SD) and 11 controls (CTRL; body mass 77.8\
  \ \xB1 6.0 kg). Pulmonary O2 uptake (V\u0307o 2) and vastus lateralis muscle fractional\
  \ O2extraction (by near-infrared spectroscopy) were determined during an incremental\
  \ cycle ergometer (CE) and one-leg knee-extension (KE) exercise. Mitochondrial respiration\
  \ was evaluated ex vivo by high-resolution respirometry in permeabilized vastus\
  \ lateralis fibers obtained by biopsy. Quadriceps femoris muscle cross-sectional\
  \ area, volume (determined by magnetic resonance imaging), and strength were greater\
  \ in RTA vs. CTRL (by \u223C40%, \u223C33%, and \u223C20%, respectively). V\u0307\
  o2peak during CE was higher in RTA vs. CTRL (4.05 \xB1 0.64 vs. 3.56 \xB1 0.30 l/min);\
  \ no difference between groups was observed during KE. The O2 cost of CE exercise\
  \ was not different between groups. When divided per muscle mass (for CE) or quadriceps\
  \ muscle mass (for KE), V\u0307o2 peak was lower (by 15-20%) in RTA vs. CTRL. Vastus\
  \ lateralis fractional O2 extraction was lower in RTA vs. CTRL at all work rates,\
  \ during both CE and KE. RTA had higher ADP-stimulated mitochondrial respiration\
  \ (56.7 \xB1 23.7 pmol O2\u02D9s-1\u02D9mg -1 ww) vs. CTRL (35.7 \xB1 10.2 pmol\
  \ O2\u02D9s -1mg-1 ww) and a tighter coupling of oxidative phosphorylation. In RTA,\
  \ the greater muscle mass and maximal force and the enhanced mitochondrial respiration\
  \ seem to compensate for the hypertrophy-induced impaired peripheral O2 diffusion.\
  \ The net results are an enhanced whole body oxidative function at peak exercise\
  \ and unchanged efficiency and O2 cost at submaximal exercise, despite a much greater\
  \ body mass. Copyright \xA9 2013 the American Physiological Society."
