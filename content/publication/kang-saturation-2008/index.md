abstract: "The aim of this study was to establish if patients with hemodynamically\
  \ relevant or irrelevant stenoses of the extracranial internal carotid artery have\
  \ different intracranial arterial oxygen saturation as measured by transcranial\
  \ pulse oximetry using near infrared spectroscopy. Patients with unilateral stenosis\
  \ 70% according to North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET)\
  \ were included. Hemodynamic relevance was assessed using ultrasound criteria. Transcranial\
  \ spectroscopy recordings were taken before and after surgical or interventional\
  \ treatment of the stenosis. Optodes were placed bilaterally on the intact frontoparietal\
  \ aspect of the skull. Oxygen saturation and diversion angle alpha from the hemoglobin\
  \ plane were measured. There were no significant differences regarding arterial\
  \ oxygen saturation between the two groups. Oxygen saturation ranged from 0.910\
  \ \xB1 0.08 to 0.957 \xB1 0.028 in the subgroups (all values asmean\xB1 S.E.). These\
  \ values are consistent with previous studies and theoretical values. In smokers\
  \ we found a significantly shifted diversion angle from the hemoglobin plane to\
  \ the negative side. This indicates the presence of an absorber other than oxy-\
  \ and desoxyhemoglobin in the optical field. Weconclude that transcranial pulse\
  \ oximetry cannot distinguish between patients with hemodynamically relevant and\
  \ irrelevant stenosis of the internal carotid artery. However it seems to be capable\
  \ of distinguishing smokers from non-smokers. \xA9 2008 Springer Science+Business\
