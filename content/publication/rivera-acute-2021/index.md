abstract: 'Background: The application of blood flow restriction (BFR) induces local
  ischemic hypoxia within the muscle(s) distal to the restriction device. Systemic
  hypoxemia via oxygen or barometric pressure manipulation achieves whole-body hypoxia
  and thus may be a more potent exercise adjunct than BFR. Therefore, the purpose
  of this study was to examine the acute effects of local ischemic hypoxia versus
  systemic hypoxemia on maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) torque, electromyographic
  amplitude (EMG AMP), EMG mean power frequency (MPF), and cognition.  Materials and
  Methods: Twelve recreationally trained women (mean age ± standard deviation = 21 ± 1.6
  years) performed 75 submaximal (1 × 30, 3 × 15) unilateral leg extension muscle
  actions under normoxia, local ischemic hypoxia, and systemic hypoxemia. Before and
  immediately after the 75 repetitions, MVIC muscle actions were performed, and surface
  EMG was simultaneously assessed from the vastus lateralis. Cognitive function was
  assessed immediately after each exercise using the Automated Neuropsychological
  Assessment Metrics (ANAM). Separate repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs)
  were performed to examine changes in MVIC, reaction time, EMG AMP, and EMG MPF responses
  during the MVIC muscle actions.  Results: There were no significant (p = 0.21–0.953)
  Condition × Time interactions for MVIC, EMG AMP, or EMG MPF but a significant (p textless 0.001–0.005)
  main effect for the Time collapsed across Condition for MVIC torque (pretest 238.8 ± 19.5,
  posttest 212.7 ± 20.1 Nm) and EMG MPF (88.5% ± 1.4% of pretest). There were no significant
  (p = 0.503) differences in reaction time among Conditions.  Conclusions: The findings
  of the present study suggest that all three conditions elicited comparable acute
  changes in performance as assessed by MVIC torque that were associated with no changes
  in muscle activation but decrease in action potential conduction velocity. Therefore,
  the application of local ischemic hypoxia or systemic hypoxemia during low-load
  resistance exercise can be used to elicit similar acute physiological responses
  and not adversely affect cognitive function relative to nonhypoxic conditions.'
