 abstract = {(1) Background: Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is an innovative and non-invasive technology used to investigate muscular oxygenation. The aim of this study is to assess the within- and between-session reliability of the NIRS Portamon (Artinis, Elst, Netherlands) device following three sets of induced muscle ischemia. (2) Methods: Depending on the experimental group (G1, G2 or G3), a cuff was inflated three times on the left upper arm to 50 mmHg (G1), systolic blood pressure (SBP) + 50 mmHg (G2) or 250 mmHg (G3). Maximum, minimum and reoxygenation rate values were assessed after each occlusion phase, using a Portamon device placed on the left brachioradialis. Reliability was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) value and ICC 95% confidence interval (CI-95%), coefficient of variation (CV) and standard error of measurement (SEM) (3) Results: Our results showed a good to excellent reliability for maximums and minimums within-session. However, the reoxygenation rate within sessions as well as measurements between sessions cannot predominantly show good reliability. (4) Conclusions: Multiple measurements of maximums and minimums within a single session appeared to be reliable which shows that only one measurement is necessary to assess these parameters. However, it is necessary to be cautious with a comparison of maximum, minimum and reoxygenation rate values between sessions.},
