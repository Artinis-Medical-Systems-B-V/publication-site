abstract: '(1) Background: Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is an innovative and
  non-invasive technology used to investigate muscular oxygenation. The aim of this
  study is to assess the within- and between-session reliability of the NIRS Portamon
  (Artinis, Elst, Netherlands) device following three sets of induced muscle ischemia.
  (2) Methods: Depending on the experimental group (G1, G2 or G3), a cuff was inflated
  three times on the left upper arm to 50 mmHg (G1), systolic blood pressure (SBP)
  + 50 mmHg (G2) or 250 mmHg (G3). Maximum, minimum and reoxygenation rate values
  were assessed after each occlusion phase, using a Portamon device placed on the
  left brachioradialis. Reliability was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficient
  (ICC) value and ICC 95% confidence interval (CI-95%), coefficient of variation (CV)
  and standard error of measurement (SEM) (3) Results: Our results showed a good to
  excellent reliability for maximums and minimums within-session. However, the reoxygenation
  rate within sessions as well as measurements between sessions cannot predominantly
  show good reliability. (4) Conclusions: Multiple measurements of maximums and minimums
  within a single session appeared to be reliable which shows that only one measurement
  is necessary to assess these parameters. However, it is necessary to be cautious
  with a comparison of maximum, minimum and reoxygenation rate values between sessions.'
