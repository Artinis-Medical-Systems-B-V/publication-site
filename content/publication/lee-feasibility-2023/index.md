abstract: To date, budget management in virtual shopping training has not been given
  much importance. The main objective of this study was to investigate the effects
  of virtual shopping budget-management training on executive functions and brain
  activation. Sixteen participants were randomly assigned to the experimental group
  that received virtual shopping budget-management training or the waitlist control
  group for a total of 16 sessions. To examine the effects of virtual shopping budget-management
  training on brain activation, HbO2 was measured in the prefrontal cortex via functional
  near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during the Trail Making Test Part B (TMT-B) and
  Stroop test. Mannâ€“Whitney and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare outcomes
  between and within the two groups. The virtual shopping budget-management training
  showed no significant difference in all outcomes between both groups (p textgreater
  0.05). No significant differences were observed in HbO2 levels during both TMT-B
  (p textgreater 0.05) and the Stroop test (p textgreater 0.05). However, in the pre-post
  comparisons, there was a significant difference in the TMT-B (p textless 0.05) and
  Stroop test (p textless 0.05) in the experimental group. In this study, although
  we did not find a distinct advantage in training, it confirmed its potential for
  clinical benefits in healthy young adults through training.
