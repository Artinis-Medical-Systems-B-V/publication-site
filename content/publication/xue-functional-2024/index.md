abstract: Understanding the clinical implications of combined patterns of blood pressure
  and brain oxygenation dynamics during the transition from lying to standing remains
  limited. These dynamics can be investigated non-invasively in humans through a standardized
  active stand (AS) test, which involves continuous monitoring of blood pressure using
  digital artery photoplethysmography and frontal brain oxygenation using near-infrared
  spectroscopy (NIRS). While NIRS output is commonly assessed in terms of the tissue
  saturation index (TSI), it can also be quantified by the absolute concentration
  of oxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb). This study aimed to explore functional clustering
  of systolic blood pressure (sBP) and frontal brain oxygenation during the AS test
  within The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA), comparing the health correlates
  of TSI and O2Hb clustered with the K-shape algorithm. 2793 participants from TILDA
  wave 3 were included, with a mean age of 64.5 years and 46.9% being male. Both clustering
  methodologies revealed statistically significant associations with participantsâ€™
  characteristics, including age, sex, body mass index, pulse wave velocity, cardiovascular
  medication usage, and usual gait speed. Notably, the TSI_sBP clustering approach
  uniquely captured variations in the MMSE cognitive score and history of cardiovascular
  disease, whereas the O2Hb_sBP clustering method specifically identified variations
  in post-stand orthostatic intolerance symptoms and future mortality. It was revealed
  that, when coupled with sBP signal, O2Hb information was associated with a clinically
  important longitudinal outcome, whereas TSI was not. However, external validation
  of this finding is warranted to confirm its robustness and generalizability.
