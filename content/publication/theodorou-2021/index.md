abstract: "The present study aimed to investigate whether acute L-citrulline supplementation\
  \ would affect inspiratory muscle oxygenation and respiratory performance. Twelve\
  \ healthy males received 6 g of L-citrulline or placebo in a double-blind crossover\
  \ design. Pulmonary function (i.e., forced expired volume in 1 s, forced vital capacity\
  \ and their ratio), maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), fractional exhaled nitric\
  \ oxide (NO\u2022), and sternocleidomastoid muscle oxygenation were measured at\
  \ baseline, one hour post supplementation, and after an incremental resistive breathing\
  \ protocol to task failure of the respiratory muscles. The resistive breathing task\
  \ consisted of 30 inspirations at 70% and 80% of MIP followed by continuous inspirations\
  \ at 90% of MIP until task failure. Sternocleidomastoid muscle oxygenation was assessed\
  \ using near-infrared spectroscopy. One-hour post-L-citrulline supplementation,\
  \ exhaled NO\u2022 was significantly increased (19.2%; p < 0.05), and this increase\
  \ was preserved until the end of the resistive breathing (16.4%; p < 0.05). In contrast,\
  \ no difference was observed in the placebo condition. Pulmonary function and MIP\
  \ were not affected by the L-citrulline supplementation. During resistive breathing,\
  \ sternocleidomastoid muscle oxygenation was significantly reduced, with no difference\
  \ noted between the two supplementation conditions. In conclusion, a single ingestion\
  \ of 6 g L-citrulline increased NO\u2022 bioavailability but not the respiratory\
  \ performance and inspiratory muscle oxygenation."
