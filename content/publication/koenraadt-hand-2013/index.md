abstract: "Fast cyclic movements and discrete motor acts are controlled differently,\
  \ presumably because fast cyclic tasks are more automated, thereby depending on\
  \ different circuits. If fast cyclic movements are made less predictable (e.g.,\
  \ by mixing frequencies), one would predict that their control will be less automated,\
  \ requiring increased activity in motor cortical areas. The present functional near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy (fNIRS) study investigated whether switching between frequencies\
  \ increases the motor cortex activity compared to movements at single rates. Therefore,\
  \ hand tapping at mixed frequencies (\"mixed\") was compared with hand tapping at\
  \ 0.4 (\"low frequency\"), 0.8 (\"mid-frequency\"), and 1.4 Hz (\"high frequency\"\
  ). Oxy-hemoglobin (HbO) and deoxy-hemoglobin (HbR) concentration changes were studied\
  \ in eleven healthy subjects with eight-channel fNIRS covering the hand motor cortex.\
  \ Repeated-measures ANOVAs revealed significant main effects for the type of task\
  \ in HbO and HbR. Post hoc analysis showed a larger HbO increase and HbR decrease\
  \ for the mixed task compared to the low- and high-frequency conditions. In addition,\
  \ the mid-frequency condition revealed a smaller HbR decrease compared to the mixed\
  \ task. Single frequency data indicated the existence of separate motor control\
  \ systems for low- and high-frequency movements. The increased activity for the\
  \ mixed task is suggested to be the result of the recruitment of a voluntary command\
  \ motor system instead of automated systems. \xA9 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."
