  \ during locomotor exercise in humans. J Appl Physiol 115: 634-642, 2013. First\
  \ published June 27, 2013; doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.00606. 2013.-The development\
  \ of muscle fatigue is oxygen (O2)-delivery sensitive [arterial O2 content (CaO2)\
  \ \xD7 limb blood flow (QL)]. Locomotor exercise in acute hypoxia (AH) is, compared\
  \ with sea level (SL), associated with reduced CaO2 and exaggerated inspiratory\
  \ muscle work (Winsp), which impairs QL, both of which exacerbate fatigue individually\
  \ by compromising O2 delivery. Since chronic hypoxia (CH) normalizes CaO2 but exacerbates\
  \ Winsp, we investigated the consequences of a 14-day exposure to high altitude\
  \ on exercise-induced locomotor muscle fatigue. Eight subjects performed the identical\
  \ constant-load cycling exercise (138 \xB1 14 W; 11 \xB1 1 min) at SL (partial pressure\
  \ of inspired O2, 147.1 \xB1 0.5 Torr), in AH (73.8 \xB1 0.2 Torr), and in CH (75.7\
  \ \xB1 0.1 Torr). Peripheral fatigue was expressed as pre- to postexercise percent\
  \ reduction in electrically evoked potentiated quadriceps twitch force ( $\u0394\
  $Qtw,pot). Central fatigue was expressed as the exercise-induced percent decrease\
  \ in voluntary muscle activation ($\u0394$VA). Resting CaO2 at SL and CH was similar,\
  \ but CaO2 in AH was lower compared with SL and CH (17.3 \xB1 0.5, 19.3 \xB1 0.7,\
  \ 20.3 \xB1 1.3 ml O2/dl, respectively). Winsp during exercise increased with acclimatization\
  \ (SL: 387 \xB1 36, AH: 503 \xB1 53, CH: 608 \xB1 67 cmH2O\u02D9s -1\u02D9min-1;\
  \ P < 0.01). Exercise at SL did not induce central or peripheral fatigue. $\u0394\
  $Qtw,pot was significant but similar in AH and CH (21 \xB1 2% and 19 \xB1 3%; P\
  \ < 0.24). $\u0394$VA was significant in both hypoxic conditions but smaller in\
  \ CH vs. AH (4 \xB1 1% vs. 8 \xB1 2%; P < 0.05). In conclusion, acclimatization\
  \ to severe altitude does not attenuate the substantial impact of hypoxia on the\
  \ development of peripheral fatigue. In contrast, acclimatization attenuates, but\
  \ does not eliminate, the exacerbation of central fatigue associated with exercise\
  \ in severe AH. Copyright \xA9 2013 the American Physiological Society."
