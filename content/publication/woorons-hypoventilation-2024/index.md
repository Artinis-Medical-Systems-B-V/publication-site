abstract: 'Purpose: To investigate the effects of a repeated-sprint training in hypoxia
  induced by voluntary hypoventilation at low lung volume (RSH-VHL) including end-expiratory
  breath holding (EEBH) of maximal duration. Methods: Over a 4-week period, twenty
  elite judo athletes (10 women and 10 men) were randomly split into two groups to
  perform 8 sessions of rowing repeated-sprint exercise either with RSH-VHL (each
  sprint with maximal EEBH) or with unrestricted breathing (RSN, 10-s sprints). Before
  (Pre-), 5 days after (Post-1) and 12 days after (Post-2) the last training session,
  participants completed a repeated-sprint ability (RSA) test on a rowing ergometer
  (8 × 25-s “all-out” repetitions interspersed with 25 s of passive recovery). Power
  output (PO), oxygen uptake, perceptual-motor capacity (turning off a traffic light
  with a predetermined code), cerebral (Δ[Hbdiff]) and muscle (Δ[Hb/Mb]diff) oxygenation,
  cerebral total haemoglobin concentration (Δ[THb]) and muscle total haemoglobin/myoglobin
  concentration (Δ[THb/Mb]) were measured during each RSA repetition and/or recovery
  period. Results: From Pre-to Post-1 and Post-2, maximal PO, mean PO (MPO) of the
  first half of the test (repetitions 1–4), oxygen uptake, end-repetition cerebral
  Δ[Hbdiff] and Δ[THb], end-repetition muscle Δ[Hb/Mb]diff and Δ[THb/Mb] and perceptual-motor
  capacity remained unchanged in both groups. Conversely, MPO of the second half of
  the test (repetitions 5–8) was higher at Post-1 than at Pre-in RSH-VHL only (p textless
  0.01), resulting in a lower percentage decrement score over the entire RSA test
  (20.4% ± 6.5% vs. 23.9% ± 7.0%, p = 0.01). Furthermore, MPO (5–8) was greater in
  RSH-VHL than in RSN at Post-1 (p = 0.04). These performance results were accompanied
  by an increase in muscle Δ[THb/Mb] (p textless 0.01) and a concomitant decrease
  in cerebral Δ[THb] (p textless 0.01) during the recovery periods of the RSA test
  at Post-1 in RSH-VHL. Conclusion: Four weeks of RSH-VHL including maximal EEBH improved
  the ability of elite judo athletes to repeat high-intensity efforts. The performance
  improvement, observed 5 days but not 12 days after training, may be due to enhanced
  muscle perfusion. The unchanged oxygen uptake and the decrease in cerebral regional
  blood volume observed at the same time suggest that a blood volume redistribution
  occurred after the RSH-VHL intervention to meet the increase in muscle perfusion.'
