abstract: "Inverse-dynamic models often use cost functions to solve the load-sharing\
  \ problem. Although it is often assumed that energy is minimised, most cost functions\
  \ are based on mechanically related measures like muscle force or stress. The aim\
  \ of this study was to analyse the relationships of two cost functions with experimentally\
  \ determined data on muscle energy consumption. Four subjects performed isometric\
  \ contractions generating combinations of elbow flexion/extension and pro/supination\
  \ moments. Muscle oxygen consumption (V\u0307O2) of the m. biceps breve, m. biceps\
  \ longum, m. brachioradialis and m. triceps laterale was measured with near infrared\
  \ spectroscopy. Both cost functions were implemented into an existing inverse-dynamic\
  \ shoulder and elbow model and the individual cost values per muscle were calculated,\
  \ normalised and subsequently compared to experimental V\u0307O2 values. The minimum\
  \ stress cost function led to a good correspondence between V\u0307O2 and cost for\
  \ the m. triceps laterale but for the flexor muscles cost was significantly lower.\
  \ A newly proposed energy-related cost function showed, however, a far better correspondence.\
  \ The inclusion of a linear term and muscle mass in the new criterion led model\
  \ results to correspond better to experimental results. The energy-related cost\
  \ function appeared to be a better measure for muscle energy consumption than the\
  \ stress cost function and led to more realistic predictions of muscle activation.\
