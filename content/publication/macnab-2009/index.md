abstract: "Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) with multichannel instruments\
  \ and grids of source-detector pairs can map regional change in oxygenation/hemodynamics.\
  \ Developed for cortical brain mapping, fNIRS technology has relevance in other\
  \ organs where pathology affects the microcirculation. We describe fNIRS of the\
  \ human bladder for evaluation of hemodynamic change during voiding. A 5\xD75-cm\
  \ grid with two source-detector pairs is placed on the abdomen suprapubically in\
  \ an asymptomatic male. In four separate trials, after natural bladder filling NIRS-derived\
  \ changes in oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb), deoxyhemoglobin (HHb), and total hemoglobin (tHb)\
  \ concentration are recorded during voiding (measured via uroflow), using four channels\
  \ of a four wavelength continuous wave instrument. Graphic and video images (topographic\
  \ mapping software) are generated. Changes in tHb occur following permission to\
  \ void that predominantly reflected variation in O2Hb; tHb peaks at maximum urine\
  \ flow then falls to a nadir lasting to uroflow end. Change in fNIRS video color\
  \ intensity correlates with graphic change in chromophore concentration. Color variations\
  \ across the mapped area suggest regional hemodynamic variation. fNIRS bladder studies\
  \ generate reproducible chromophore data consistent with single channel studies,\
  \ but the dynamic color video and larger tissue area monitored potentially offer\
  \ new methodology for investigating regional variations in bladder oxygenation and\
  \ hemodynamics. \xA9 2009 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers."
