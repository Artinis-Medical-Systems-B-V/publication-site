 abstract = {Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) with multichannel instruments and grids of source-detector pairs can map regional change in oxygenation/hemodynamics. Developed for cortical brain mapping, fNIRS technology has relevance in other organs where pathology affects the microcirculation. We describe fNIRS of the human bladder for evaluation of hemodynamic change during voiding. A 5×5-cm grid with two source-detector pairs is placed on the abdomen suprapubically in an asymptomatic male. In four separate trials, after natural bladder filling NIRS-derived changes in oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb), deoxyhemoglobin (HHb), and total hemoglobin (tHb) concentration are recorded during voiding (measured via uroflow), using four channels of a four wavelength continuous wave instrument. Graphic and video images (topographic mapping software) are generated. Changes in tHb occur following permission to void that predominantly reflected variation in O2Hb; tHb peaks at maximum urine flow then falls to a nadir lasting to uroflow end. Change in fNIRS video color intensity correlates with graphic change in chromophore concentration. Color variations across the mapped area suggest regional hemodynamic variation. fNIRS bladder studies generate reproducible chromophore data consistent with single channel studies, but the dynamic color video and larger tissue area monitored potentially offer new methodology for investigating regional variations in bladder oxygenation and hemodynamics. © 2009 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.},
