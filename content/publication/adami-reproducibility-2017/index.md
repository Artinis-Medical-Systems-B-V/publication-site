abstract: "Low muscle oxidative capacity contributes to exercise intolerance in chronic\
  \ obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) allows\
  \ non-invasive determination of the muscle oxygen consumption (mV\u0307O2) recovery\
  \ rate constant (k), which is proportional to oxidative capacity assuming two conditions\
  \ are met: 1) exercise intensity is sufficient to fully-activate mitochondrial oxidative\
  \ enzymes; 2) sufficient O2 availability. We aimed to determine reproducibility\
  \ (coefficient of variation, CV; intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC) of NIRS\
  \ k assessment in the gastrocnemius of 64 participants with (FEV1 64 \xB1 23%predicted)\
  \ or without COPD (FEV1 98 \xB1 14%predicted). 10\u201315 s dynamic contractions\
  \ preceded 6 min of intermittent arterial occlusions (5\u201310 s each, \u223C250\
  \ mmHg) for k measurement. k was lower (P < 0.05) in COPD (1.43 \xB1 0.4 min\u2212\
  1; CV = 9.8 \xB1 5.9%, ICC = 0.88) than controls (1.74 \xB1 0.69 min\u22121; CV\
  \ = 9.9 \xB1 8.4%; ICC = 0.93). Poor k reproducibility was more common when post-contraction\
  \ mV\u0307O2 and deoxygenation were low, suggesting insufficient exercise intensity\
  \ for mitochondrial activation and/or the NIRS signal contained little light reflected\
  \ from active muscle. The NIRS assessment was well tolerated and reproducible for\
  \ muscle dysfunction evaluation in COPD."
