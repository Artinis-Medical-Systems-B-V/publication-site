abstract: "Due to its cardiovascular effects sedentary behaviour might impact cerebrovascular\
  \ function in the long term, affecting cerebrovascular regulatory mechanisms and\
  \ perfusion levels. Consequently this could underly potential structural brain abnormalities\
  \ associated with cognitive decline. We therefore assessed the association between\
  \ sedentary behaviour and brain measures of cerebrovascular perfusion and structural\
  \ abnormalities in community-dwelling older adults. Using accelerometery (GENEActiv)\
  \ data from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) we categorised individuals\
  \ by low- and high-sedentary behaviour (\u22648 vs >8 hours/day). We examined prefrontal\
  \ haemoglobin oxygenation levels using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy during rest and\
  \ after an orthostatic challenge in 718 individuals (66 \xB1 8 years, 52% female).\
  \ Global grey matter cerebral blood flow, total grey and white matter volume, total\
  \ and subfield hippocampal volumes, cortical thickness, and white matter hyperintensities\
  \ were measured using arterial spin labelling, T1, and FLAIR MRI in 86 individuals\
  \ (72 \xB1 6 years, 55% female). While no differences in prefrontal or global cerebral\
  \ hemodynamics were found between groups, high-sedentary individuals showed lower\
  \ hippocampal volumes and increased white matter hyperintensities compared to their\
  \ low-sedentary counterparts. Since these structural cerebral abnormalities are\
  \ associated with cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease, future work exploring\
  \ the causal pathways underlying these differences is needed."
