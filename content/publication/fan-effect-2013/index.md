abstract: "During heavy exercise, hyperventilation-induced hypocapnia leads to cerebral\
  \ vasoconstriction, resulting in a reduction in cerebral blood flow (CBF). A reduction\
  \ in CBF would impair cerebral O2 delivery and potentially account for reduced exercise\
  \ performance in hypoxia. We tested the hypothesis that end-tidal Pco2 (PETCO2)\
  \ clamping in hypoxic exercise would prevent the hypocapnia-induced reduction in\
  \ CBF during heavy exercise, thus improving exercise performance. We measured PETCO2,\
  \ middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAv; index of CBF), prefrontal cerebral cortex\
  \ oxygenation (cerebral O2Hb; index of cerebral oxygenation), cerebral O2 delivery\
  \ (DO2), and leg muscle oxygenation (muscle O2Hb) in 10 healthy men (age 27 \xB1\
  \ 7 years; VO2max 63.3 \xB1 6.6 mL/kg/min; mean \xB1 SD) during simulated 15-km\
  \ time trial cycling (TT) in normoxia and hypoxia (FIO2 = 0.10) with and without\
  \ CO2 clamping. During exercise, hypoxia elevated MCAv and lowered cerebral O2Hb,\
  \ cerebral DO2, and muscle O2Hb (P < 0.001). CO2 clamping elevated PETCO2 and MCAv\
  \ during exercise in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions (P < 0.001 and P = 0.024),\
  \ but had no effect on either cerebral and muscle O2Hb (P = 0.118 and P = 0.124).\
  \ Nevertheless, CO2 clamping elevated cerebral DO2 during TT in both normoxic and\
  \ hypoxic conditions (P < 0.001). CO2 clamping restored cerebral DO2 to normoxic\
  \ values during TT in hypoxia and tended to have a greater effect on TT performance\
  \ in hypoxia compared to normoxia (P = 0.097). However, post hoc analysis revealed\
  \ no effect of CO2 clamping on TT performance either in normoxia (P = 0.588) or\
  \ in hypoxia (P = 0.108). Our findings confirm that the hyperventilation-induced\
  \ hypocapnia and the subsequent drop in cerebral oxygenation are unlikely to be\
  \ the cause of the reduced endurance exercise performance in hypoxia."
