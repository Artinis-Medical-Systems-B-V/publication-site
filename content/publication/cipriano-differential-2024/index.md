abstract: 'This study aims to (1) compare the kinetics of pulmonary oxygen uptake
  (VO2p), skeletal muscle deoxygenation ([HHb]), and microvascular O2 delivery (QO2mv)
  between heart failure (HF) patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and those
  with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and (2) explore the correlation between
  body composition, kinetic parameters, and exercise performance. Twenty-one patients
  (10 HFpEF and 11 HFrEF) underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing to assess VO2
  kinetics, with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) employed to measure [HHb]. Microvascular
  O2 delivery (QO2mv) was calculated using the Fick principle. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry
  (DEXA) was performed to evaluate body composition. HFrEF patients exhibited significantly
  slower VO2 kinetics (time constant [t]: 63 ± 10.8 s vs. 45.4 ± 7.9 s; P textless 0.05)
  and quicker [HHb] response (t: 12.4 ± 9.9 s vs. 25 ± 11.6 s; P textless 0.05). Microvascular
  O2 delivery (QO2mv) was higher in HFrEF patients (3.6 ± 1.2 vs. 1.7 ± 0.8; P textless 0.05),
  who also experienced shorter time to exercise intolerance (281.6 ± 84 s vs. 405.3 ± 96
  s; P textless 0.05). Correlation analyses revealed a significant negative relationship
  between time to exercise and both QO2mv (ρ= -0.51; P textless 0.05) and VO2 kinetics
  (ρ= -0.63). Body adiposity was negatively correlated with [HHb] amplitude (ρ= -0.78)
  and peak VO2 (ρ= -0.54), while a positive correlation was observed between lean
  muscle percentage, [HHb] amplitude, and tau (ρ= 0.74 and 0.57; P textless 0.05),
  respectively. HFrEF patients demonstrate more severely impaired VO2p kinetics, skeletal
  muscle deoxygenation, and microvascular O2 delivery compared to HFpEF patients,
  indicating compromised peripheral function. Additionally, increased adiposity and
  reduced lean mass are linked to decreased oxygen diffusion capacity and impaired
  oxygen uptake kinetics in HFrEF patients.'
