abstract: "Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of overground\
  \ locomotor training (OLT) on walking endurance and gastrocnemius oxygen extraction\
  \ in people with chronic cervical motor-incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). Design:\
  \ Prospective single-arm pre\u2013post pilot study. Setting: Human Performance Research\
  \ Laboratory. Participants: Adult men with traumatic chronic cervical SCI (n = 6;\
  \ age = 30.8 \xB1 12.5). Intervention: Twenty-four sessions of structured OLT. Outcome\
  \ measures: Walking endurance was determined during a constant work-rate time-to-exhaustion\
  \ treadmill test. Normalized perceived fatigability was calculated by dividing subjective\
  \ ratings of tiredness by walking time. Cardiorespiratory outcomes and muscle oxygen\
  \ extraction were analyzed using breath-by-breath gas-exchange and near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy. Results: OLT resulted in large effects on walking endurance (1232\
  \ \xB1 446 s vs 1645 \xB1 255 s; d = 1.1; P = 0.045) and normalized perceived fatigability\
  \ (5.3 \xB1 1.5 a.u. vs 3.6 \xB1 0.9 a.u.; d = 1.3; P = 0.033). Small-to-medium\
  \ effects on absolute (2.8 \xB1 2.5 a.u. vs 4.2 \xB1 3.5 a.u.; d = 0.42; P = 0.035)\
  \ and isotime (2.8 \xB1 2.5 a.u. vs 3.8 \xB1 3.0 a.u.; d = 0.33; P = 0.023) muscle\
  \ oxygen extraction were also observed after OLT. Conclusion: These findings provide\
  \ preliminary data supporting the potential for improved walking endurance, enhanced\
  \ muscle O2 extraction, and reduced perceived fatigability in people with chronic\
  \ cervical motor-incomplete SCI following the OLT program described in this study."
