abstract: "Purpose Sickle cell disease (SCD) patients exhibit a limited exercise tolerance\
  \ commonly attributed to anaemia, as well as hemorheological and cardio-respiratory\
  \ abnormalities, but the functional status of skeletal muscle at exercise is unknown.\
  \ Moreover, the effect of SCD genotype on exercise tolerance and skeletal muscle\
  \ function has been poorly investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate\
  \ skeletal muscle function and fatigue during a submaximal exercise in SCD patients.\
  \ Methods Nineteen healthy individuals (AA), 28 patients with sickle cell anaemia\
  \ (SS) and 18 with sickle cell-haemoglobin C disease (SC) performed repeated knee\
  \ extensions exercise (FAT). Maximal isometric torque (Tmax) was measured before\
  \ and after the FAT to quantify muscle fatigability. Electromyographic activity\
  \ and oxygenation by near-infrared spectroscopy of the Vastus Lateralis were recorded.\
  \ Results FAT caused a reduction in Tmax in SS (\u2212 17.0 \xB1 12.1%, p < 0.001)\
  \ and SC (\u2212 21.5 \xB1 14.5%, p < 0.05) but not in AA (+ 0.58 \xB1 29.9%). Root-mean-squared\
  \ value of EMG signal (RMS) decreased only in SS after FAT, while the median power\
  \ frequency (MPF) was unchanged in all groups. Oxygenation kinetics were determined\
  \ in SS and AA and were not different. Conclusion These results show skeletal muscle\
  \ dysfunction during exercise in SCD patients, and suggest different fatigue aetiology\
  \ between SS and SC. The changes in EMG signal and oxygenation kinetics during exercise\
  \ suggest that the greater skeletal muscle fatigue occurring in SCD patients would\
  \ be rather due to intramuscular alterations modifications than decreased tissue\
  \ oxygenation. Moreover, SS patients exhibit greater muscle fatigability than SC."
