abstract: "Cerebral blood flow and oxygenation are crucial for maintaining healthy\
  \ brain structure and function, with hypoperfusion and hypometabolism associated\
  \ with neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric conditions. Chronic stress and elevated\
  \ cortisol have also been associated with cognitive decline, poor mental health\
  \ and peripheral vascular and cerebrovascular changes. It is plausible that glucocorticoids\
  \ could alter brain structure and function through increased vulnerability to hypoperfusion\
  \ and reduced oxygenation. The aim of the current study was to investigate the association\
  \ between hair glucocorticoids (GCs) and frontal lobe oxygenation using near-infra\
  \ red spectroscopy (NIRS) in a population sample of 1078 older adults. Data from\
  \ Wave 3 of The Irish Longitudinal Study of Ageing was analysed. Hair samples were\
  \ taken for the analysis of glucocorticoids and NIRS was used to measure frontal\
  \ lobe oxygenation. After both minimal and full adjustment for covariates, hair\
  \ cortisol and the cortisol-to-cortisone ratio were associated with lower Tissue\
  \ Saturation Index (TSI; cortisol: B = \u22120.37, CI \u22120.60 to \u22120.14,\
  \ p = .002; ratio: B = \u22120.43, CI \u22120.70 to \u22120.16, p = .002). Cortisone\
  \ was not significantly associated with TSI (B = \u22120.17, CI \u22120.55 to.21,\
  \ p = .388). The finding of an inverse relationship between frontal lobe oxygenation\
  \ and GCs as assessed over a period of months may indicate that reduced oxygenation\
  \ is one pathway through which chronically elevated GCs affect brain health and\
  \ function. However, no causality can be inferred from the current data and prospective\
  \ studies are required to interrogate this."
