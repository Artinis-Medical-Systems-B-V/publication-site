abstract: "Background: Nitrate is a precursor of nitric oxide (NO), an important regulator\
  \ of cerebral perfusion in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Nitrate supplementation\
  \ could be used to improve cerebral perfusion and oxygenation during exercise in\
  \ hypoxia. The effects of dietary nitrate supplementation on cerebral haemodynamics\
  \ during exercise in severe hypoxia (arterial O2 saturation < 70%) have not been\
  \ explored. Methods: In twelve trained male cyclists, we measured blood pressure\
  \ (BP), middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv), cerebrovascular resistance\
  \ (CVR) and prefrontal oxyhaemoglobin and deoxyhaemoglobin concentration (O2Hb and\
  \ HHb, respectively) during 15 km cycling time trials (TT) in normoxia and severe\
  \ hypoxia (11% inspired O2, peripheral O2 saturation $\u223C$66%) following 3-day\
  \ oral supplementation with placebo or sodium nitrate (0.1 mmol/kg/day) in a randomised,\
  \ double-blinded manner. We tested the hypothesis that dietary nitrate supplementation\
  \ increases MCAv and cerebral O2Hb during TT in severe hypoxia. Results: During\
  \ TT in normoxia, nitrate supplementation lowered MCAv by $\u223C$2.3 cm/s and increased\
  \ cerebral O2Hb by $\u223C$6.8 $\u03BC$M and HHb by $\u223C$2.1 $\u03BC$M compared\
  \ to normoxia placebo (p = 0.01 for all), while BP tended to be lowered (p = 0.06).\
  \ During TT in severe hypoxia, nitrate supplementation elevated MCAv (by $\u223C\
  $2.5 cm/s) and BP (by $\u223C$5 mmHg) compared to hypoxia placebo (p < 0.01 for\
  \ both), while it had no effect on cerebral O2Hb (p = 0.98), HHb (p = 0.07) or PETCO2\
  \ (p = 0.12). Dietary nitrate had no effect of CVR during TT in normoxia or hypoxia\
  \ (p = 0.19). Conclusion: Our findings indicate that during normoxic TT, the modulatory\
  \ effect of dietary nitrate on regional and global cerebral perfusion is heterogeneous.\
  \ Meanwhile, the lack of major changes in cerebral perfusion with dietary nitrate\
  \ during hypoxic TT alludes to an exhausted cerebrovascular reserve."
