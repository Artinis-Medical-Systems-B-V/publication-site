abstract: "Performing absolute measurements of tissue saturation of the brain with\
  \ near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a clinically desirable brain monitoring tool.\
  \ Tissue oxygenation index (TOI) is an indicator of absolute tissue mixed arterial\
  \ and venous oxygen saturation, and can be calculated using a NIRS technique called\
  \ spatially resolved spectroscopy (SRS). SRS instruments measure the change of light\
  \ attenuation with distance by using multiple light source-detector distances at\
  \ two or more wavelengths. The aim of the study is to use broadband NIRS SRS data\
  \ to investigate the effects on the calculation of TOI of different parameters:\
  \ wavelength selection, scattering dependence, source-detector distance, and resolving\
  \ for water. In total, 55 neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy were monitored\
  \ using a broadband multi-distance continuous wave NIRS system; 172 datasets were\
  \ recorded. Using a \u201CStandard\u201D approach, TOI values between 0 and 100%\
  \ (\u201Cgood\u201D) were calculated in 157/172 datasets with a mean TOI of 50%.\
  \ By changing the wavelength selection, the number of \u201Cgood\u201D data sets\
  \ increases to 165/172 with a mean of 60%. Alteration of the dependence of scattering\
  \ on wavelength acts as a constant which shifts the absolute value of TOI significantly\
  \ (p\_<\_0.05), demonstrating the importance of having a subject-appropriate estimation\
  \ of scattering dependence. In general, changing the combination of source-detector\
  \ distances does not significantly alter the TOI (the mean TOI ranges from 41% to\
  \ 53%) which suggests that the algorithm is robust to different source-detector\
  \ combinations. The study shows the broadband NIRS SRS algorithm gives the opportunity\
  \ to explore the calculation of TOI and could further improve the measurement of\
  \ tissue saturation in a clinical setting."
