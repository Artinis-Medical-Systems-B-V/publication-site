abstract: "Fatigability and muscle oxygen consumption (mVO2) during sustained voluntary\
  \ isometric knee extensions are less at extended (30\xB0 knee angle; 07deg;, full\
  \ extension) versus flexed knee angles (907deg;). This lower energy consumption\
  \ may partially result from lower neural activation at extended knee angles. We\
  \ hypothesized a smaller difference in mVO2 between extended and flexed knee angles\
  \ during electrical stimulation, which guaranteed maximal activation, than during\
  \ maximal voluntary contractions (MVC). In eight healthy young males, MVC extension\
  \ torque was obtained at 30\xB0, 607deg; and 907deg; knee angles. mVO2 of the rectus\
  \ femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL) and medialis muscle was measured using near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy during tetanic (10 s) and maximal voluntary (15 s) contractions (MVC15).\
  \ For electrically induced contractions, steady state mVO2 was reached at similar\
  \ (P > 0.05) times after torque onset (4.6 \xB1 0.7 s) at all knee angles. In contrast,\
  \ during MVC15 at 30\xB0 mVO2 was reached at 7.1 \xB1 1.1 s, significantly later\
  \ compared to 60\xB0 and 907deg; knee angles. The knee angle dependent differences\
  \ in mVO2 were not lower in electrically induced contractions (as hypothesised)\
  \ but were similar as in voluntary contractions. Normalized mVO2 at 30\xB0 (percentage\
  \ 90\xB0 knee angle) was 79.0 \xB1 9.4% (across muscles) for electrically induced\
  \ and 79.5 \xB1 7.6% (across muscles) for voluntary contractions (P < 0.05). We\
  \ conclude that the slower onset of mVO2 during voluntary effort at 30\xB0 may have\
  \ been due to a lower maximal activation. However, because steady state mVO2 both\
  \ during electrically induced and voluntary contractions was \u223C20% less at extended\
  \ versus flexed knee angles, the causes for the lower mVO2 must reside within the\
  \ muscle itself. \xA9 Springer-Verlag 2007."
