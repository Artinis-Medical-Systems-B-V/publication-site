abstract: "Acute prolonged sitting leads to cerebrovascular disruptions. However,\
  \ it is unclear how prolonged sitting interacts with other common behaviors, including\
  \ high- (HGI) and low- glycemic index (LGI) meals. Using a double- blind randomized\
  \ cross- over design, this study evaluated the effects of prolonged (3 hr) sitting,\
  \ with a high- (HGI; GI: 100) or low- glycemic index (LGI; GI: 19) meal on total\
  \ brain blood flow (QBrain) and executive function. Eighteen young, healthy, active\
  \ participants (22.6 [3.1] y, 33% F, 24.3 [3.7] kg/m2) sat for 3 hr after consuming\
  \ an HGI or LGI meal. Using Doppler ultrasound to measure internal carotid (ICA)\
  \ and vertebral (VA) artery blood flow, QBrain was calculated: (ICA blood flow +\
  \ VA blood flow) \xD7 2. Executive function was assessed using the Stroop Test and\
  \ Trail Making Test\u2014 Part B. Brain fog was measured using a modified Borg Category\
  \ Scale with Ratio properties (CR10). Following 3 hr of sitting, there was a significant\
  \ decrease in QBrain with time (p = .001, ES = \u22120.26), though there were nonsignificant\
  \ interaction (p = .216) and condition effects (p = .174). Brain fog increased (p\
  \ = .024, ES = 0.27) and Stroop re- action time worsened with time (p = .001, ES:\
  \ \u22120.40), though there were nonsignifi- cant condition effects for brain fog\
  \ (p = .612) and the Stroop test (p = .445). There was a nonsignificant condition\
  \ effect (p = .729) for the Trail Making Test\u2014 Part B, but completion time\
  \ improved with time (p = .001, ES = \u22120.40). In conclusion, 3 hr of prolonged\
  \ sitting decreases QBrain and executive function independent of glycemic index\
  \ in young, healthy adults."
