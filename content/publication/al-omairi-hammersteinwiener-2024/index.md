abstract: 'Participant movement is a major source of artifacts in functional near-infrared
  spectroscopy (fNIRS) experiments. Mitigating the impact of motion artifacts (MAs)
  is crucial to estimate brain activity robustly. Here, we suggest and evaluate a
  novel application of the nonlinear Hammerstein–Wiener model to estimate and mitigate
  MAs in fNIRS signals from direct-movement recordings through IMU sensors mounted
  on the participant’s head (head-IMU) and the fNIRS probe (probe-IMU). To this end,
  we analyzed the hemodynamic responses of single-channel oxyhemoglobin (HbO) and
  deoxyhemoglobin (HbR) signals from 17 participants who performed a hand tapping
  task with different levels of concurrent head movement. Additionally, the tapping
  task was performed without head movements to estimate the ground-truth brain activation.
  We compared the performance of our novel approach with the probe-IMU and head-IMU
  to eight established methods (PCA, tPCA, spline, spline Savitzky–Golay, wavelet,
  CBSI, RLOESS, and WCBSI) on four quality metrics: SNR, △AUC, RMSE, and R. Our proposed
  nonlinear Hammerstein–Wiener method achieved the best SNR increase (p textless 0.001)
  among all methods. Visual inspection revealed that our approach mitigated MA contaminations
  that other techniques could not remove effectively. MA correction quality was comparable
  with head- and probe-IMUs.'
