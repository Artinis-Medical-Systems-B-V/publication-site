abstract: Recognition of typical patterns of brain response to external stimuli using
  near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) may become a gateway to detecting covert consciousness
  in clinically unresponsive patients. This is the first fNIRS study on the cortical
  hemodynamic response to favorite music using a frequency domain approach. The aim
  of this study was to identify a possible marker of cognitive response in healthy
  subjects by investigating variations in the oscillatory signal of fNIRS in the spectral
  regions of low-frequency (LFO) and very-low-frequency oscillations (VLFO). The experiment
  consisted of two periods of exposure to preferred music, preceded and followed by
  a resting phase. Spectral power in the LFO region increased in all the subjects
  after the first exposure to music and decreased again in the subsequent resting
  phase. After the second music exposure, the increase in LFO spectral power was less
  distinct. Changes in LFO spectral power were more after first music exposure and
  the repetition-related habituation effect strongly suggest a cerebral origin of
  the fNIRS signal. Recognition of typical patterns of brain response to specific
  environmental stimulation is a required step for the concrete validation of a fNIRS-based
  diagnostic tool.
