abstract: Objective. There is a growing consensus that interpersonal processes are
  key to understanding psychotherapy. How might that be reflected in the brain? Recent
  research proposes that inter-brain synchrony is a crucial neural component of interpersonal
  interaction. The current proof-of-concept study examines, for the first time, therapist-patient
  inter-brain synchrony measurement during multiple sessions. To guide the design
  of future studies, we performed a precursory test in a small sample of the association
  between inter-brain synchrony and therapeutic change, hypothesizing that it would
  gradually increase over therapy, reflecting inter-brain plasticity. Method. We scanned
  18 therapy sessions of participants (N = 8) who underwent a 6-session test anxiety
  treatment. We measured therapist and patient brain activity using functional near-infrared
  spectroscopy (fNIRS) and assessed perceived session quality, wellbeing, symptoms,
  and therapeutic alliance every session. Results. In this proof-of-concept sample
  inter-brain synchrony gradually increased over treatment, and was associated with
  reduced symptoms, improved wellbeing and perceived session quality, but not with
  a stronger therapeutic alliance. fNIRS imaging had no discernable adverse effects.
  Conclusion. Our findings demonstrate that fNIRS imaging during psychotherapy is
  a feasible and viable research method and that inter-brain plasticity should be
  a candidate for future research on biological mechanisms underlying therapeutic
  change.
