abstract: Purpose We examined how heat exposure affects muscle and cerebral oxygenation
  kinetics using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) during repeated treadmill sprints.  Methods
  Eleven recreationally active males performed three sets of five 5-s sprints with
  25 s of recovery and 3 min between sets in hot (38 °C) and temperate (25 °C) conditions.
  Continuous measurements of muscle (vastus lateralis) and cerebral (prefrontal cortex)
  tissue oxygenation were obtained using near-infrared spectroscopy. One-way ANOVA
  SPMF statistics were applied to pooled sprint data, with each condition including
  15 time-series (three sets of five sprints) combined. Each time-series included
  the sprint and subsequent recovery phases.  Results Muscle tissue saturation index
  further decreased in hot compared to temperate condition, from the middle of the
  5-s sprint phase (~ 2.9 s) until the end of the recovery period (p textless 0.001),
  while total hemoglobin concentration was significantly higher in the early phase
  of recovery (from 5.1 to 11.8 s, p = 0.003). Cerebral tissue saturation index decreased
  from 0.7 s to 13.0 s (p textless 0.001) in the heat. Total hemoglobin concentration
  was lower in hot condition during both the sprint phase and the initial third of
  the recovery (from 0 to 11.7 s, p textless 0.001), as well as during the recovery
  (from 20.5 to 24.8 s, p = 0.007).  Conclusion Adding heat stress to repeating treadmill
  sprints further lowered muscle oxygenation levels during both the sprint and recovery
  phases, and limited cerebral tissue perfusion during the sprint and the initial
  recovery phases. The use of SPM for continuous analysis of near-infrared spectroscopy
  data provides new insights beyond summary statistics.
