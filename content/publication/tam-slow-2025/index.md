abstract: When exercising in the severe‐intensity domain, oxygen uptake (V̇O2) does
  not reach a steady state since it slowly and continuously drifts due to the appearance
  of the slow component of V̇O2 (V̇O2sc). V̇O2sc has been customarily evaluated by
  measuring V̇O2 using pulmonary gas exchanges, including the contribution of the
  metabolic expenditure of the respiratory muscles, heart, and muscles recruited for
  stabilizing the posture, etc. We assessed the muscular oxygen uptake (mV̇O2, in
  μM·s−1) of flexor digitorum superficialis by using near‐infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)
  during brief arterial occlusions imposed over repeated, cyclic isometric hand grips
  performed at two different percentages (25%; 50%) of maximal voluntary contraction
  (MVC). mV̇O2 was significantly larger at 50% MVC than at 25% MVC at all the time
  points (p textless 0.05) as expected, apart from the values at the 3rd minute. Secondly,
  mV̇O2 increased linearly at 25% of MVC (mV̇O2 = 1.73 + 0.108 × min; r 2 = 0.993;
  p textless 0.0033) and at 50% of MVC (mV̇O2 = 2.41 + 0.240 × min; r 2 = 0.956; p textless 0.0223)
  from the 3rd minute of exercise onwards; the slopes of the two linear regressions
  were significantly different (p textless 0.0232). We suggest that the V̇O2sc of
  mV̇O2 occurring during intermittent isometric contractions can be assessed with
  NIRS during brief complete arterial occlusions regularly interspersed in the series
  of contractions. In addition, the technique can discriminate the rates of increase
  of mV̇O2 corresponding to different percentages of MVC.
