abstract: "Purpose: This study investigated the effects of repeated-sprint (RS) training\
  \ in hypoxia induced by voluntary hypoventilation at low lung volume (RSH-VHL) on\
  \ physiological adaptations, RS ability (RSA) and anaerobic performance. Methods:\
  \ Over a 3-week period, eighteen well-trained cyclists completed six RS sessions\
  \ in cycling either with RSH-VHL or with normal conditions (RSN). Before (Pre) and\
  \ after (Post) the training period, the subjects performed an RSA test (10 \xD7\
  \ 6-s all-out cycling sprints) during which oxygen uptake (V \u02D9 O 2) and the\
  \ change in both muscle deoxyhaemoglobin ($\u0394$[HHb]) and total haemoglobin ($\u0394\
  $[THb]) were measured. A 30-s Wingate test was also performed and maximal blood\
  \ lactate concentration ([La]max) was assessed. Results: At Post compared to Pre,\
  \ the mean power output during both the RSA and the Wingate tests was improved in\
  \ RSH-VHL (846 \xB1 98 vs 911 \xB1 117\_W and 723 \xB1 112 vs 768 \xB1 123\_W, p\
  \ < 0.05) but not in RSN (834 \xB1 52 vs 852 \xB1 69\_W, p = 0.2; 710 \xB1 63 vs\
  \ 713 \xB1 72\_W, p = 0.68). The average V \u02D9 O 2 recorded during the RSA test\
  \ was significantly higher in RSH-VHL at Post but did not change in RSN. No change\
  \ occurred for $\u0394$[THb] whereas $\u0394$[HHb] increased to the same extent\
  \ in both groups. [Lamax] after the Wingate test was higher in RSH-VHL at Post (13.9\
  \ \xB1 2.8 vs 16.1 \xB1 3.2\_mmol\_L\u22121, p < 0.01) and tended to decrease in\
  \ RSN (p = 0.1). Conclusions: This study showed that RSH-VHL could bring benefits\
  \ to both RSA and anaerobic performance through increases in oxygen delivery and\
  \ glycolytic contribution. On the other hand, no additional effect was observed\
  \ for the indices of muscle blood volume and O2 extraction."
