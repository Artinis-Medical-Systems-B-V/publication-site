The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is an important node for action planning in the frontoparietal reaching network but its role in reaching in children with cerebral palsy (CP) is unexplored. This case–control study combines a robotic task with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to concurrently assess reaching accuracy and PFC activity during time-constrained, goal-directed reaching in children with CP. We hypothesized that reaching accuracy in children with CP would be lower than in typically developing children and would be related to PFC activity.
Methods
Fourteen children with spastic CP (5-11 y; Manual Ability Classification System level I-II) and 14 age-, sex- and arm dominance-matched typically developing controls performed seated uniplanar reaches with a robotic arm (KINARM End-Point Lab) to hit visual targets projected onto a screen. Four blocks of 10 reaching trials each were performed for each arm. Time constraint (high, low) was varied across blocks by changing the time participants had to hit the target.
Results
Children with CP displayed lower reaching accuracy compared to controls, with greater deficits observed in the non-preferred arm (d = 1.916, p \textless 0.001) than the preferred arm (d = 1.033, p = 0.011). Inter-limb differences in accuracy were observed only in children with CP (d = 0.839, p \textless 0.001). PFC activity differed across groups during preferred arm reaching, with PFC deactivation observed in children with CP under high time constraints compared to PFC activation in controls (d = 1.086, p = 0.006). Children with CP also exhibited lower PFC activity under high time constraint compared to low time constraint in the preferred arm (d = 0.702, p = 0.001). PFC activity was positively related to reaching accuracy across time constraints in both arms in children with CP, but not in controls.
Conclusions
Contrasting patterns of PFC activity observed in children with CP compared to age- and sex-matched controls during a robotic reaching task lends support for the concurrent use of fNIRS and robotics to assess goal-directed reaching in CP.},
