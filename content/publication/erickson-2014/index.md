abstract: "After spinal cord injury (SCI) skeletal muscle decreases in size, increases\
  \ in intramuscular fat, and has potential declines in mitochondrial function. Reduced\
  \ mitochondrial function has been linked to the development of metabolic disease.\
  \ The aim of this study was to measure mitochondrial function in persons with SCI\
  \ using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Oxygen consumption of the vastus lateralis\
  \ muscle was measured with NIRS during repeated short-duration arterial occlusions\
  \ in nine able-bodied (AB) and nine persons with motor complete SCI. Skeletal muscle\
  \ oxidative capacity (V max) was evaluated with two approaches: (1) rate constant\
  \ of the recovery of oxygen consumption after exercise and (2) extrapolated maximum\
  \ oxygen consumption from a progressive work test. V max as indicated by the rate\
  \ constant (k) from the recovery kinetics test was lower in SCI compared with AB\
  \ participants (k: SCI 0.7 \xB1 0.3 vs. AB 1.9 \xB1 0.4 min-1; p < 0.001). Time\
  \ constants were SCI 91.9 \xB1 37.8 vs. AB 33.6 \xB1 8.3 s. V max from the progressive\
  \ work test approached a significant difference between groups (SCI 5.1 \xB1 2.9\
  \ vs. AB 9.8 \xB1 5.5 % Hb-Mb/s; p = 0.06). NIRS measurements of V max suggest a\
  \ deficit of 50-60 % in participants with SCI compared with AB controls, consistent\
  \ with previous studies using 31P-MRS and muscle biopsies. NIRS measurements can\
  \ assess mitochondrial capacity in people with SCI and potentially other injured/diseased\
  \ populations. \xA9 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."
