abstract: In the overlap between Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Cinematics,
  sits an interest in physiological responses to experiences. Focusing particularly
  on brain data, Neurocinematics has emerged as a research field using Brain-Computer
  Interface (BCI) sensors. Where previous work found inter subject correlations (ISC)
  between brain measurements of people watching movies in constrained conditions using
  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we seek to examine similar responses
  in more naturalistic settings using functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS).
  fNIRS has been shown to be highly suitable for HCI studies, being more portable
  than fMRI and more tolerant of many natural movements than Electroencephalography
  (EEG). Early results found significant ISC, which gives a lot of hope and potential
  for using fNIRS in Neurocinematics.
