 abstract = {In the overlap between Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Cinematics, sits an interest in physiological responses to experiences. Focusing particularly on brain data, Neurocinematics has emerged as a research field using Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) sensors. Where previous work found inter subject correlations (ISC) between brain measurements of people watching movies in constrained conditions using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we seek to examine similar responses in more naturalistic settings using functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). fNIRS has been shown to be highly suitable for HCI studies, being more portable than fMRI and more tolerant of many natural movements than Electroencephalography (EEG). Early results found significant ISC, which gives a lot of hope and potential for using fNIRS in Neurocinematics.},
