abstract: "The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of venous occlusion\
  \ per se on forearm muscle blood flow, as determined by the near-infrared spectroscopy\
  \ (NIRS) venous occlusion technique (NIRS-VOT). NIRS data were obtained from the\
  \ flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) muscle on the dominant arm of 16 young, ostensibly\
  \ healthy participants (14 men and two women; 30\_\xB1\_6\_year; 73\_\xB1\_7\_kg).\
  \ Participants completed a series of five venous occlusion trials while seated at\
  \ rest, and a series of 12 venous occlusion trials during a reactive hyperaemia\
  \ induced by 5\_min of forearm arterial occlusion. The NIRS-VOT was used to assess\
  \ FDS muscle blood flow ((Formula presented.)), beat-by-beat, over the first four\
  \ cardiac beats during venous occlusions. (Formula presented.) was also reported\
  \ as a cumulative value, wherein the first two, first three and first four cardiac\
  \ beats were used to calculate muscle blood flow. We observed that (Formula presented.)\
  \ was highest when calculated over the first cardiac beat during venous occlusions\
  \ performed at rest and throughout reactive hyperaemia (P<0\u02D905). Moreover,\
  \ the inclusion of more than one cardiac beat in the calculation of (Formula presented.)\
  \ underestimated muscle blood flows, irrespective of the prevailing level of arterial\
  \ inflow. These findings support the idea that venous occlusion per se affects the\
  \ measurement of (Formula presented.) via the NIRS-VOT. Accordingly, it is recommended\
  \ that (Formula presented.) is determined over the first cardiac beat when using\
  \ the NIRS-VOT to assess microvascular blood flow of human forearm muscles."
