abstract: Background Few studies have evaluated the impact of exercise on specific
  skeletal muscle microvascular function, despite its importance. This study aimed
  to assess the acute and chronic effects of cycling exercise on microvascular reactivity
  in the upper and lower extremities of young healthy females. Methods Eighteen young
  healthy females performed an acute bout of cycling exercise on a cycle ergometer
  at 75% of their maximal heart rate for 30 minutes, both before and after cycling
  training three times a week for eight weeks. For each bout of acute exercise, microvascular
  function in the biceps brachii (BB) and vastus lateralis (VL) muscles was assessed
  using near-infrared spectroscopy coupled with the post-occlusive reactive hyperemia
  technique, measured pre-exercise and at 20-, 40-, and 60-minutes post-exercise.
  Body composition was assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry before and
  after training. Results Total body fat mass, abdominal fat mass and leg fat mass
  were significantly reduced by training. Before training, cycling exercise acutely
  improved microvascular reactivity in BB but not in VL. Eight weeks of cycling training
  significantly improved resting microvascular reactivity in BB but not in VL. Training
  had no impact on post-exercise microvascular reactivity at VL, but elicited improvement
  in BB. Conclusions Acute and chronic cycling exercise enhanced skeletal muscle microvascular
  responses in the upper extremity of young healthy females, but this effect was not
  observed in the lower extremity. Training enhanced post-exercise microvascular responses
  at upper extremity but not lower extremity.
