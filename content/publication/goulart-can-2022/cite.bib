To evaluate the effect of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) on (1) metabolic, ventilatory, and hemodynamic responses; and (2) cerebral (Cox), respiratory, and peripheral oxygenation when compared with SHAM ventilation during the high-intensity exercise in patients with coexisting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart failure (HF).


Methods and Results

On separate days, patients performed incremental cardiopulmonary exercise testing and two constant-work rate tests receiving NIPPV or controlled ventilation (SHAM) (the bilevel mode—Astral 150) in random order until the limit of tolerance (Tlim). During exercise, oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb+Mb) and deoxyhemoglobin (DeoxyHb+Mb) were assessed using near-infrared spectroscopy (Oxymon, Artinis Medical Systems, Einsteinweg, The Netherlands). NIPPV associated with high-intensity exercise caused a significant increase in exercise tolerance, peak oxygen consumption (

Conclusion
Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation during constant work-rate exercise led to providing the respiratory muscle unloading with greater oxygen supply to the peripheral muscles, reducing muscle fatigue, and sustaining longer exercise time in patients with COPD-HF.},
