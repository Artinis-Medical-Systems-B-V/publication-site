abstract: Aim To evaluate the effect of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation
  (NIPPV) on (1) metabolic, ventilatory, and hemodynamic responses; and (2) cerebral
  (Cox), respiratory, and peripheral oxygenation when compared with SHAM ventilation
  during the high-intensity exercise in patients with coexisting chronic obstructive
  pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart failure (HF).   Methods and Results  On separate
  days, patients performed incremental cardiopulmonary exercise testing and two constant-work
  rate tests receiving NIPPV or controlled ventilation (SHAM) (the bilevel mode—Astral
  150) in random order until the limit of tolerance (Tlim). During exercise, oxyhemoglobin
  (OxyHb+Mb) and deoxyhemoglobin (DeoxyHb+Mb) were assessed using near-infrared spectroscopy
  (Oxymon, Artinis Medical Systems, Einsteinweg, The Netherlands). NIPPV associated
  with high-intensity exercise caused a significant increase in exercise tolerance,
  peak oxygen consumption (     V ·   O 2     in mlO 2 ·kg −1 ·min −1 ), minute ventilation
  peak (       V ·   E     in ml/min), peak peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ,
  %), and lactate/tlim (mmol/s) when compared with SHAM ventilation. In cerebral,
  respiratory, and peripheral muscles, NIPPV resulted in a lower drop in OxyHb+Mb
  ( p &lt; 0.05) and an improved deoxygenation response DeoxyHb+Mb ( p &lt; 0.05)
  from the half of the test (60% of Tlim) when compared with SHAM ventilation.    Conclusion
  Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation during constant work-rate exercise led
  to providing the respiratory muscle unloading with greater oxygen supply to the
  peripheral muscles, reducing muscle fatigue, and sustaining longer exercise time
  in patients with COPD-HF.
