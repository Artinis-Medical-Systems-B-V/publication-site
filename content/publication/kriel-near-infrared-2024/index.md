abstract: Vascular diseases of the lower limb contribute substantially to the global
  burden of cardiovascular disease and comorbidities such as diabetes. Importantly,
  microvascular dysfunction can occur prior to, or alongside, macrovascular pathology,
  and both potentially contribute to patient symptoms and disease burden. Here, we
  describe a non-invasive approach using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during
  reactive hyperemia, which provides a standardized assessment of lower limb vascular
  (dys)function and a potential method to evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic interventions.
  Unlike alternative methods, such as contrast-enhanced ultrasound, this approach
  does not require venous access or sophisticated image analysis, and it is inexpensive
  and less operator-dependent. This description of the NIRS method includes representative
  results and standard terminology alongside the discussion of measurement considerations,
  limitations, and alternative methods. Future application of this work will improve
  standardization of vascular research design, data collection procedures, and harmonized
  reporting, thereby enhancing translational research outcomes in the areas of lower
  limb vascular (dys)function, disease, and treatment.
