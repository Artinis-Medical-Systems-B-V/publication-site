abstract: This study aimed to use functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) mobile
  neuroimaging technology to examine changes in prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity before,
  during, and after yoga asana (physical yoga postures). A total of 27 healthy adults
  participated in a 23 min yoga asana session using a block design. Before and after
  the sequence, participants completed two 6 min, task-independent resting states.
  PFC activity was continuously recorded using the fNIRS instrument, positioned on
  the frontal area of the skull. The session included a control posture alternating
  with three active postures. Each active posture was held for 30 s, followed by a
  25-30 s control posture interval, and repeated eight times. This block design resulted
  in 25 control posture intervals and 24 repetitions of each active posture. Analysis
  included preprocessing of raw fNIRS data to calculate concentrations of oxyhemoglobin
  (HbO) and deoxyhemoglobin (HbR), motion artifact correction, and statistical evaluation
  using ANOVA with Bonferroni corrections. Connectivity analyses examined interhemispheric
  and intrahemispheric correlations in the prefrontal cortex. In conclusion, this
  study demonstrates the utility of fNIRS in real-world, movement based contexts and
  provides neurological insights into the effects of yoga asana.
