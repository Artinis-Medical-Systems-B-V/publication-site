abstract: "Upon stimulation, real time maps of cortical hemodynamic responses can\
  \ be obtained by non-invasive functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) which\
  \ measures changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin after positioning multiple\
  \ sources and detectors over the human scalp. The current commercially available\
  \ transportable fNIRS systems have a time resolution of 1-10. Hz, a depth sensitivity\
  \ of about 1.5. cm, and a spatial resolution of about 1. cm. The goal of this brief\
  \ review is to report infants, children and adults fNIRS language studies. Since\
  \ 1998, 60 studies have been published on cortical activation in the brain's classic\
  \ language areas in children/adults as well as newborns using fNIRS instrumentations\
  \ of different complexity. In addition, the basic principles of fNIRS including\
  \ features, strengths, advantages, and limitations are summarized in terms that\
  \ can be understood even by non specialists. Future prospects of fNIRS in the field\
  \ of language processing imaging are highlighted. \xA9 2011 Elsevier Inc."
