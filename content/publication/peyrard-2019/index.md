abstract: "Purpose: This study aimed to determine the effects of hypoxia and/or blood\
  \ flow restriction (BFR) on an arm-cycling repeated sprint ability test (aRSA) and\
  \ its impact on elbow flexor neuromuscular function. Methods: Fourteen volunteers\
  \ performed an aRSA (10\_s sprint/20\_s recovery) to exhaustion in four randomized\
  \ conditions: normoxia (NOR), normoxia plus BFR (NBFR), hypoxia (FiO2 = 0.13, HYP)\
  \ and hypoxia plus BFR (HBFR). Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), resting twitch\
  \ force (Db10), and electromyographic responses from the elbow flexors [biceps brachii\
  \ (BB)] to electrical and transcranial magnetic stimulation were obtained to assess\
  \ neuromuscular function. Main effects of hypoxia, BFR, and interaction were analyzed\
  \ on delta values from pre- to post-exercise. Results: BFR and hypoxia decreased\
  \ the number of sprints during aRSA with no significant cumulative effect (NOR 16\
  \ \xB1 8; NBFR 12 \xB1 4; HYP 10 \xB1 3 and HBFR 8 \xB1 3; P < 0.01). MVC decrease\
  \ from pre- to post-exercise was comparable whatever the condition. M-wave amplitude\
  \ (\u2212 9.4 \xB1 1.9% vs. + 0.8 \xB1 2.0%, P < 0.01) and Db10 force (\u2212 41.8\
  \ \xB1 4.7% vs. \u2212 27.9 \xB1 4.5%, P < 0.01) were more altered after aRSA with\
  \ BFR compared to without BFR. The exercise-induced increase in corticospinal excitability\
  \ was significantly lower in hypoxic vs. normoxic conditions (e.g., BB motor evoked\
  \ potential at 75% of MVC: \u2212 2.4 \xB1 4.2% vs. + 16.0 \xB1 5.9%, respectively,\
  \ P = 0.03). Conclusion: BFR and hypoxia led to comparable aRSA performance impairments\
  \ but with distinct fatigue etiology. BFR impaired the muscle excitation\u2013contraction\
  \ coupling whereas hypoxia predominantly affected corticospinal excitability indicating\
  \ incapacity of the corticospinal pathway to adapt to fatigue as in normoxia."
