abstract: "Increased local blood supply is thought to be one of the mechanisms underlying\
  \ oxidative adaptations to interval training regimes. The relationship of exercise\
  \ intensity with local blood supply and oxygen availability has not been sufficiently\
  \ evaluated yet. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of six different\
  \ intensities (40\u201390% peak oxygen uptake, VO2peak) on relative changes in oxygenated,\
  \ deoxygenated and total haemoglobin ($\u0394$O2Hb, $\u0394$HHb, $\u0394$THb) concentration\
  \ after exercise as well as end-exercise $\u0394$HHb/$\u0394$VO2 as a marker for\
  \ microvascular O2 distribution. Seventeen male subjects performed an experimental\
  \ protocol consisting of 3\_min cycling bouts at each exercise intensity in randomized\
  \ order, separated by 5\_min rests. $\u0394$O2Hb and $\u0394$HHb were monitored\
  \ with near-infrared spectroscopy of the vastus lateralis muscle, and VO2 was assessed.\
  \ $\u0394$HHb/$\u0394$VO2 increased significantly from 40% to 60% VO2peak and decreased\
  \ from 60% to 90% VO2peak. Post-exercise $\u0394$THb and $\u0394$O2Hb showed an\
  \ overshoot in relation to pre-exercise values, which was equal after 40\u201360%\
  \ VO2peak and rose significantly thereafter. A plateau was reached following exercise\
  \ at \u226580% VO2peak. The results suggest that there is an increasing mismatch\
  \ of local O2 delivery and utilization during exercise up to 60% VO2peak. This insufficient\
  \ local O2 distribution is progressively improved above that intensity. Further,\
  \ exercise intensities of \u226580% VO2peak induce highest local post-exercise O2\
  \ availability. These effects are likely due to improved microvascular perfusion\
  \ by enhanced vasodilation, which could be mediated by higher lactate production\
  \ and the accompanying acidosis."
