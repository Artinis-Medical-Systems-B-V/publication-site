abstract: 'Background: Evidence has demonstrated that non-habitual exercise, such
  as eccentric exercise, can increase reactive oxygen species and induce endothelial
  dysfunction, which plays a central role in the development of cardiovascular disease.
  Polyphenol-rich foods, such as cocoa, have been widely investigated in vascular
  function due to their antioxidant effect. Aims: The goal of this study was to evaluate
  the impact of microencapsulated cocoa (MC) polyphenols in the flow-mediated dilation
  (FMD) response and forearm muscle oxygenation (StO2) parameters after an eccentric
  exercise. Methods: Thirteen physically active adults were enrolled in a randomized,
  double-blind, and crossover study. FMD and StO2 were evaluated before and after
  24 h, 48 h, and 72 h of eccentric exercise and MC or placebo supplementation. Results:
  No significant difference in FMD response and StO2 parameters was observed after
  MC and placebo (p textgreater 0.05). Conclusions: A single dose of MC did not change
  FMD and muscle StO2 parameters after eccentric exercise in healthy individuals.'
