 abstract = {Background: Evidence has demonstrated that non-habitual exercise, such as eccentric exercise, can increase reactive oxygen species and induce endothelial dysfunction, which plays a central role in the development of cardiovascular disease. Polyphenol-rich foods, such as cocoa, have been widely investigated in vascular function due to their antioxidant effect. Aims: The goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of microencapsulated cocoa (MC) polyphenols in the flow-mediated dilation (FMD) response and forearm muscle oxygenation (StO2) parameters after an eccentric exercise. Methods: Thirteen physically active adults were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, and crossover study. FMD and StO2 were evaluated before and after 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h of eccentric exercise and MC or placebo supplementation. Results: No significant difference in FMD response and StO2 parameters was observed after MC and placebo (p \textgreater 0.05). Conclusions: A single dose of MC did not change FMD and muscle StO2 parameters after eccentric exercise in healthy individuals.},
