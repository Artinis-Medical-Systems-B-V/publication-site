abstract: "The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of in vivo quantitative\
  \ near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in skeletal muscle at various workloads. NIRS\
  \ was used for the quantitative measurement of O2 consumption (mVO2) in the human\
  \ flexor digitorum superficialis muscle at rest and during rhythmic isometric handgrip\
  \ exercise in a broad range of work intensities (10-90% MVC = maximum voluntary\
  \ contraction force). Six subjects were tested on three separate days. No significant\
  \ differences were found in mVO2 measured over different days with the exception\
  \ of the highest workload. The within-subject variability for each workload measured\
  \ over the three measurements days ranged from 15.7 to 25.6% and did not increase\
  \ at the high workloads. The mVO2 was 0.14 \xB1 0.01 mlO2 min-1 100 g-1 at rest\
  \ and increased roughly 19 times to 2.68 \xB1 0.58 mlO2 min-1 100 g-1 at 72% MVC.\
  \ These results show that local muscle oxygen consumption at rest as well as during\
  \ exercise at a broad range of work intensities can be measured reliably by NIRS,\
  \ applied to a uniform selected subject population. This is of great importance\
  \ as direct local measurement of mVO2 during exercise is not possible with the conventional\
  \ techniques. The method is robust enough to measure over separate days and at various\
  \ workloads and can therefore contribute to a better understanding of human physiology\
  \ in both the normal and pathological state of the muscle."
