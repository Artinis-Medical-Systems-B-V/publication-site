abstract: "Ventilatory chemosensitivity, cerebral and muscle oxygenation, and total\
  \ hemoglobin mass before and after a 72-day Mt. Everest expedition. High Alt Med\
  \ Biol 15:331-340, 2014. - Background: We investigated the effects of chronic hypobaric\
  \ hypoxic acclimatization, performed over the course of a 72-day self-supported\
  \ Everest expedition, on ventilatory chemosensitivity, arterial saturation, and\
  \ tissue oxygenation adaptation along with total hemoglobin mass (tHb-mass) in nine\
  \ experienced climbers (age 37\xB16 years, 55\xB17 mL\u02D9kg<sup>-1</sup>\u02D9\
  min<sup>-1</sup>). Methods: Exercise-hypoxia tolerance was tested using a constant\
  \ treadmill exercise of 5.5 km\u02D9h<sup>-1</sup>at 3.8% grade (mimicking exertion\
  \ at altitude) with 3-min steps of progressive normobaric poikilocapnic hypoxia.\
  \ Breath-by-breath ventilatory responses, Spo<inf>2</inf>, and cerebral (frontal\
  \ cortex) and active muscle (vastus lateralis) oxygenation were measured throughout.\
  \ Acute hypoxic ventilatory response (AHVR) was determined by linear regression\
  \ slope of ventilation vs. Spo<inf>2</inf>. PRE and POST (<15 days) expedition,\
  \ tHb-mass was measured using carbon monoxide-rebreathing. Results: Post-expedition,\
  \ exercise-hypoxia tolerance improved (11:32\xB13:57 to 16:30\xB12:09 min, p<0.01).\
  \ AHVR was elevated (1.25\xB10.33 to 1.63\xB10.38 L\u02D9min<sup>-1.</sup>%<sup>-1</sup>Spo<inf>2</inf>,\
  \ p<0.05). Spo<inf>2</inf>decreased throughout exercise-hypoxia in both trials,\
  \ but was preserved at higher values at 4800 m post-expedition. Cerebral oxygenation\
  \ decreased progressively with increasing exercise-hypoxia in both trials, with\
  \ a lower level of deoxyhemoglobin POST at 2400, 3500 and 4800 m. Muscle oxygenation\
  \ also decreased throughout exercise-hypoxia, with similar patterns PRE and POST.\
  \ No relationship was observed between the slope of AHVR and cerebral or muscle\
  \ oxygenation either PRE or POST. Absolute tHb-mass response exhibited great individual\
  \ variation with a nonsignificant 5.4% increasing trend post-expedition (975\xB1\
  154 g PRE and 1025\xB1124 g POST, p=0.17). Conclusions: We conclude that adaptation\
  \ to chronic hypoxia during a climbing expedition to Mt. Everest will increase hypoxic\
  \ tolerance, AHVR, and cerebral but not muscle oxygenation, as measured during simulated\
  \ acute hypoxia at sea level. However, tHb-mass did not increase significantly and\
  \ improvement in cerebral oxygenation was not associated with the change in AHVR."
