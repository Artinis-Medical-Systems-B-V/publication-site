abstract: "Due to the technical nature of speed skating, that is affecting physiological\
  \ mechanisms such as oxygenation and blood flow, this sport provides a unique setting\
  \ allowing us to uncover novel mechanistic insights of the physiological response\
  \ to exercise in elite middle-distance and endurance sports. The present study aimed\
  \ to examine the influence of skating mode (short-track vs. long-track) on muscle\
  \ oxygenation, perceived fatigue, and recovery in elite speed skating. Muscle oxygenation\
  \ of 12 talented short-track speed skaters was continuously monitored during a long-track\
  \ (LT) and a short-track (ST) skating time-trial of maximal effort using near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy (NIRS) on the m. vastus lateralis for both legs. Video captures were\
  \ made of each testing session for further interpretation of the muscle oxygenation.\
  \ To determine recovery, perceived exertion was measured 2 and 4 h after each testing\
  \ sessions. Repeated measures ANOVA's were used for statistical analysis (p < 0.05).\
  \ After a rapid desaturation in both legs directly after the start, an asymmetry\
  \ in muscle oxygenation between both legs was found during LT (tissue saturation-index\
  \ (TSI%)-slope: left = 0.053 \xB1 0.032; right = 0.023 \xB1 0.020, p < 0.05) and\
  \ ST speed skating (TSI%-slope: left = 0.050 \xB1 0.052, right = 0.001 \xB1 0.053,\
  \ p < 0.05). Resaturation of the right leg was relatively lower in ST compared to\
  \ LT. For the left leg, no difference was found between skating modes in muscle\
  \ oxygenation. Respectively, two (ST = 5.8 \xB1 2.0; LT = 4.2 \xB1 1.5) and 4 h\
  \ (ST = 4.6 \xB1 1.9; LT = 3.1 \xB1 1.6) after the time-trials, a higher rate of\
  \ perceived exertion was found for ST. Based on our results, ST seems more physiologically\
  \ demanding, and longer periods of recovery are needed after training compared to\
  \ LT. Technical aspects unique to the exercise mode seem to impact on oxygenation,\
  \ affecting processes related to the regulation of exercise intensity such as fatigue\
  \ and recovery."
