abstract: "Artificial gravity has been proposed as a method to counteract the physiological\
  \ deconditioning of long-duration spaceflight; however, the effects of hypergravity\
  \ on the central nervous system has had little study. The study aims investigate\
  \ whether there is a relationship between prefrontal cortex brain activity and prefrontal\
  \ cortex oxygenation during exposure hypergravity. Twelve healthy participants were\
  \ selected to undergo hypergravity exposure aboard a short-arm human centrifuge.\
  \ Participants were exposed to hypergravity in the +Gz axis, starting from 0.6 +Gz\
  \ for women, and 0.8 +Gz for men, and gradually increasing by 0.1 +Gz until the\
  \ participant showed signs of syncope. Brain cortical activity was measured using\
  \ electroencephalography (EEG) and localized to the prefrontal cortex using standard\
  \ low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Prefrontal cortex oxygenation\
  \ was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). significant increase in\
  \ prefrontal cortex activity (P < 0.05) was observed during hypergravity exposure\
  \ compared with baseline. Prefrontal cortex oxygenation was significantly decreased\
  \ during hypergravity exposure, with a decrease in oxyhemoglobin levels (P < 0.05)\
  \ compared with baseline and an increase in deoxyhemoglobin levels (P < 0.05) with\
  \ increasing +Gz level. No significant correlation was found between prefrontal\
  \ cortex activity and oxy-/deoxyhemoglobin. It is concluded that the increase in\
  \ prefrontal cortex activity observed during hypergravity was most likely not the\
  \ result of increased +Gz values resulting in a decreased oxygenation produced through\
  \ hypergravity exposure. No significant relationship between prefrontal cortex activity\
  \ and oxygenation measured by NIRS concludes that brain activity during exposure\
  \ to hypergravity may be difficult to measure using NIRS. Instead, the increase\
  \ in prefrontal cortex activity might be attributable to psychological stress, which\
  \ could pose a problem for the use of a short-arm human centrifuge as a countermeasure.\
