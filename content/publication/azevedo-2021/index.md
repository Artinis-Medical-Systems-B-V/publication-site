abstract: "Neuromuscular fatigue (NMF) and exercise performance are affected by exercise\
  \ intensity and sex differences. However, whether slight changes in power output\
  \ (PO) below and above the maximal lactate steady-state (MLSS) impact NMF and subsequent\
  \ performance (time to exhaustion, TTE) is unknown. Purpose: This study compared\
  \ NMF and TTE in females and males in response to exercise performed at MLSS, 10\
  \ W below (MLSS -10 ) and above (MLSS +10 ). Methods: Twenty participants (9 females)\
  \ performed three 30-min constant-PO exercise bouts followed (1 min delay) by a\
  \ TTE at 80% of the peak-PO. NMF was characterized by isometric maximal voluntary\
  \ contractions (IMVC) and femoral nerve electrical stimulation of knee extensors\
  \ [e.g. peak torque of potentiated high-frequency (Db100) and single twitch (TwPt)]\
  \ before and immediately after the constant-PO and TTE bouts. Results: IMVC declined\
  \ less after MLSS -10 (-18\xB110%) compared to MLSS (-26\xB114%) and MLSS +10 (-31\xB1\
  11%) (all p<0.05), and the Db100 decline was greater after MLSS +10 (-24\xB114%)\
  \ compared to the other intensities (MLSS -10 : -15\xB19%; MLSS: -18\xB111%) (all\
  \ p<0.05). Females showed smaller reductions in IMVC and TwPt compared to males\
  \ after constant-PO bouts (all p<0.05), this difference being not dependant on intensity.\
  \ TTE was negatively impacted by increasing the PO in the constant-PO (p<0.001),\
  \ with no differences in end-exercise NMF (p>0.05). Conclusion: Slight changes in\
  \ PO around MLSS elicited great changes in the reduction of maximal voluntary force\
  \ and impairments in contractile function. Although NMF was lower in females compared\
  \ to males, the changes in PO around the MLSS impacted both sexes similarly."
