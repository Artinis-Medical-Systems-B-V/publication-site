abstract: 'Purpose The study investigated the changes in cardiovascular and cerebral
  hemodynamics elicited by the diving response during static (SBH) and dynamic (DYNBH)
  breath-holding (BH) in moderately trained recreational breath-hold divers (BHDs).  Methods
  Nineteen BHDs (42.9 ± 7.8 years, 5.7 ± 2.5 years of breath-hold practice) participated
  in the study. Cardiovascular and cerebral hemodynamics, along with muscle and pre-frontal
  cortex oxygenation, were continuously tracked throughout a single SBH and DYNBH
  by means of arterial volume clamp, transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and near-infrared
  spectroscopy. In addition, neuron-specific enolase (NSE) was measured pre- and post-BH
  to evaluate potential neuronal stress.  Results At the end of BH, the manifestations
  of the diving response were similar in both conditions, characterized by a bradycardic
  response (SBH: − 14 ± 6%, p textless 0.05; DYNBH: − 13 ± 18%, p textless 0.05) and
  an increase in total peripheral resistance (SBH: + 127 ± 46%, p textless 0.05; DYNBH: + 116 ± 110%,
  p textless 0.05). Mean middle cerebral artery blood velocity increased significantly
  more during SBH (+ 139 ± 17%, p textless 0.05) than DYNBH (+ 109 ± 23%, p textless 0.05).
  Relative changes in pre-frontal cortex deoxygenated hemoglobin were higher during
  DYNBH compared to SBH (+ 350 ± 106% vs. + 128 ± 27%, p textless 0.05). NSE levels
  did not change pre- and post- SBH and DYNBH.  Conclusion Due to relatively attenuated
  increase in cerebral blood velocity, DYNBH resulted in a greater imbalance between
  oxygen supply and pre-frontal oxygen consumption than SBH. However, NSE levels remained
  unchanged from baseline values, suggesting that no acute neuronal damage occurred
  in either condition.'
