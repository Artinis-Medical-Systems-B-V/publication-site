abstract: 'Background: The pioneering female physiologist Frances Hellebrandt first
  highlighted the significance of the skeletal muscle pump in circulation in the 1930s.
  However, the mechanisms underlying the muscle pump''s function remain elusive, particularly
  in older individuals. It is thought that during muscle contraction, increased intramuscular
  pressure facilitates the expulsion of blood from the muscle''s veins, aiding venous
  return. This contraction-induced pressure gradient assists in pushing blood towards
  the heart, increasing preload, and subsequently stroke volume (SV). In this study
  we investigated muscle pump activity using continuous measurements of thigh muscle
  activity, thigh total haemoglobin concentration (Hb), and cardiac SV. Methods: 22
  individuals (aged 70.8±5.3 years, 77.3% female) recruited from a Falls and Syncope
  Unit (St James’s Hospital, Dublin) underwent non-invasive measurements of Hb (NIRS
  PortaLite, Artinis Medical Systems, The Netherlands), electromyography (EMG) (Shimmer3,
  Research Ltd, Ireland), and SV (Finapres Nova, Finapres Medical Systems, The Netherlands)
  during a 10-second thigh squeeze test. Pre-processing involved data quality checks,
  alignment, and resampling. 60-second regions of interest were extracted, normalised,
  and processed using MATLAB (R2023a, TheMathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). Cross-correlation
  and Granger causality analyses were conducted to explore relationships between signals.
  Results: Thigh Hb and EMG signals lagged 8.4 and 8.5 seconds behind SV, respectively.
  Granger Causality analysis revealed a significant causal relationship from both
  Hb and EMG to SV in 68% of participants at measured lags. Conclusion: The observed
  ~8.5-second lag between thigh measurements and SV implies a plausible temporal relationship
  between muscle activation and venous return, further supported by significant causal
  relationships found in a substantial portion of participants using Granger causality
  analysis. These findings underscore the importance of continued research in this
  area, not only for advancing our understanding of physiological mechanisms but also
  for informing potential clinical applications aimed at optimising cardiovascular
  health and function.'
