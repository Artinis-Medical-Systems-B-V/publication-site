abstract: "Context \u2022 Hypotension that occurs after a single bout of aerobic exercise\
  \ also attenuates the vascular response to discrete stressors, an effect that can\
  \ last for hours. It is unknown whether the hypotensive benefits of traditional\
  \ exercise extend to alternative forms of mindful exercise, such as yoga, to confer\
  \ transient protection against neurovascular challenges that increase blood pressure\
  \ (BP). Objectives \u2022 The study intended to examine the effects of acute exercise\
  \ on neurovascular responses to exposure of the forehead of female yoga practitioners\
  \ to vasoconstrictive cold (ie, to cold pressor stress). Design \u2022 The research\
  \ team designed a study with 3 conditions (ie, with participants' participation\
  \ in 3 activities on separate days in a repeated-measures design). Participants\
  \ were randomly assigned to perform the activities in 1 of 3 orders across successive\
  \ visits. Participants \u2022 Participants were 9 females, 20 to 33 y old, who had\
  \ regularly practiced Hatha yoga from 6 mo to 12 y before the start of the study.\
  \ All participants were normotensive at entry to the study and had normal body weights\
  \ for their heights. Interventions \u2022 All participants performed 3 activities:\
  \ (1) self-directed yoga practice, the intervention; (2) cycling exercise at a self-selected\
  \ intensity, a positive control; and (3) quiet rest, a negative control. Outcome\
  \ Measures \u2022 Postintervention, participants' foreheads were exposed to cold.\
  \ Their systolic blood pressures (SBPs), diastolic blood pressures (DBPs), pulse\
  \ rates, and forearm oxygenation were assessed using near-infrared spectroscopy.\
  \ Results \u2022 Participants' SBPs and DBPs increased during cold pressor stress\
  \ under all conditions, concurrent with decreased forearm oxygenation. During recovery\
  \ from the cold, participants' BPs declined to near precold pressor baseline levels\
  \ after yoga and cycling but remained elevated after quiet rest. Conclusions \u2022\
  \ The enhanced recovery of BP from cold applied to the forehead after yoga practice\
  \ or cycling exercise suggests that both types of exercise promote a hypotensive\
  \ response, which could indicate lowered cardiovascular risk."
