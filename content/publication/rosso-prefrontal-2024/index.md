abstract: 'Background: Higher prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation while walking may
  indicate reduced gait automaticity. Aim: We examine whether PFC activation during
  walking improves after training in older adults at risk for mobility disability.
  Methods: Forty-two adults aged ≥ 65 participated in a randomized clinical trial
  (NCT026637780) of a 12-week timing and coordination physical therapy intervention
  to improve walking (n = 20 intervention, n = 22 active control). PFC activation
  was measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during four walking
  tasks over 15 m, each repeated 4 times: even surface walking, uneven surface walking,
  even dual-task, uneven dual-task; dual-task was reciting every other letter of the
  alphabet while walking. Gait speed and rate of correct letter generation were recorded.
  Linear mixed models tested between arm differences in change of fNIRS, gait speed,
  and letter generation from baseline to follow-up (12-week, 24-week, and 36-week).
  Results: Intervention arms were similar in mean age (74.3 vs. 77.0) and baseline
  gait speed (0.96 vs. 0.93 m/s). Of 24 comparisons of between arm differences in
  the fNIRS signals, only two were significant which were not supported by differences
  at other follow-up times or on other tasks. Gait speed, particularly during dual-task
  conditions, and correct letter generation did improve post-intervention but improvements
  did not differ by arm. Discussion and Conclusions: After training, PFC activation
  during walking generally did not improve and did not differ by intervention arm.
  Improvements in gait speed without increased PFC activation may point toward more
  efficient neural control of walking.'
