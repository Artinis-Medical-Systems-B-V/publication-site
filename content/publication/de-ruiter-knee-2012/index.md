abstract: "Purpose: Above a given exercise intensity, rapid muscle fatigue will occur.\
  \ We explored the possibility of assessing torque threshold for peripheral fatigue\
  \ during single-legged repetitive isometric knee extensor exercise. We hypothesized\
  \ this fatigue threshold to be related to the general aerobic fitness level and\
  \ the so-called \"critical torque\" (CT) established with a recently validated 5-min\
  \ all-out test. Methods: Seventeen healthy men (V\u0307O2max = 44.7-69.6 mL\u2022\
  kg\u2022min) performed six submaximal (20%-55% maximal voluntary contraction [MVC])\
  \ 5-min bouts of 60 repetitive contractions (3-s on, 2-s off). Torque was changed\
  \ between bouts in steps of 5% MVC to estimate the highest intensity (fatigue threshold)\
  \ at which average changes in rsEMG, EMG median power frequency, and tissue deoxygenation\
  \ (near-infrared spectroscopy) of the three superficial knee extensor muscles were\
  \ still <5%, signifying steady-state exercise with minimal peripheral fatigue. On\
  \ another occasion, one bout was performed in an all-out manner with end-test torque\
  \ representing CT. Results: Fatigue threshold (40.0% \xB1 8.1% MVC) was related\
  \ (r2 = 0.57, P < 0.05) to CT (53.1% \xB1 10.0% MVC), but it was consistently lower\
  \ (P < 0.05) and only fatigue threshold was significantly related to V\u0307O2max\
  \ (r2 = 0.68), and the first (r2 = 0.45) and second (r2 = 0.63) ventilatory threshold\
  \ obtained during cycle ergometry. Conclusions: Performing submaximal bouts of knee\
  \ extensor contractions, while monitoring EMG and deoxygenation, seems a feasible\
  \ manner to estimate an aerobic capacity-related exercise intensity of peripheral\
  \ fatigue onset. This test may be used to evaluate changes in endurance capacity\
  \ of single muscle groups, without the necessity for all-out testing, which could\
  \ be problematic with frail subjects. \xA9 2012 by the American College of Sports\
