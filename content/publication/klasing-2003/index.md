abstract: "The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of in vivo quantitative\
  \ near- infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in skeletal muscle at various workloads. NIRS\
  \ was used for the quantitative measurement of O2 consumption (m _VO2) in the human\
  \ flexor digitorum superficialis muscle at rest and during rhythmic isometric handgrip\
  \ exercise in a broad range of work intensities (10\u201390% MVC\xBCmaximum voluntary\
  \ contraction force). Six subjects were tested on three separate days. No significant\
  \ differences were found in m _VO2 measured over different days with the exception\
  \ of the highest workload. The within-subject variability for each workload measured\
  \ over the three measurements days ranged from 15\xC67to25\xC66% and did not increase\
  \ at the high workloads. The m _VO2 was 0\xC614 \xB1 0\xC601 mlO2 min\u20131 100\
  \ g\u20131 at rest and increased roughly 19 times to 2\xC668 \xB1 0\xC658 mlO2 min\u2013\
  1 100 g\u20131 at 72% MVC. These results show that local muscle oxygen consumption\
  \ at rest as well as during exercise at a broad range of work intensities can be\
  \ measured reliably by NIRS, applied to a uniform selected subject population. This\
  \ is of great importance as direct local measurement of m _VO2 during exercise is\
  \ not possible with the conventional techniques. The method is robust enough to\
  \ measure over separate days and at various workloads and can therefore contribute\
  \ to a better understanding of human physiology in both the normal and pathological\
  \ state of the muscle. Introduction"
