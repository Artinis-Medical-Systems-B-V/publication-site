abstract: We sought to investigate if critical oxygenation (COx) is a robust marker
  of exercise intensity, and if it remains stable in normoxia and hypoxia with simultaneous
  changes in critical power (CP) and heart rate (HR).Thirty-three highly trained endurance
  athletes (11 females) underwent two 3-min CP cycling tests in normoxia (87 m ASL,
  FiO2 = 20.8%) and normobaric hypoxia (3200 m ASL, FiO2 = 14.2%). Repeated measures
  ANOVA with partial eta (ηp2) and omega squared (ω2) effect sizes was employed to
  compare systemic (SpO2) and muscle oxygen saturation (SmO2) at rest and COx, HR,
  and CP during exercise between normoxia and hypoxia with biological sex as an independent
  variable. Bayesian T-tests were conducted as the confirmatory analysis. Significant
  differences between normoxia and hypoxia for SpO2 and SmO2 were observed at rest
  in both sexes. During exercise, COx in the triceps brachii, CP and various HR indices
  exhibited significant differences (p textless 0.001), whereas differences were not
  significant in the vastus lateralis (p = 0.355). The Bayesian analysis supported
  these findings. The decrease in COx in the triceps brachii in hypoxia was larger
  in females than in males (30 vs. 21% drop respectively, p = 0.019). However, no
  environment×sex interaction was found for CP, HR, and COx in vastus lateralis. COx
  in locomotor muscles remains stable across the tested ambient oxygen concentrations,
  whereas CP and HR exhibit significant differences between normoxia and hypoxia.
  Accordingly, COxVL may be useful in optimizing training load and cycling performance
  under different oxygen availability conditions.
