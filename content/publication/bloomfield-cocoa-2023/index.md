abstract: We show for the first time that cocoa flavanols exert a neuroprotective
  effect during severe hypoxia. Following acute cocoa flavanol ingestion, we observed
  improvements in cognition, cerebral oxygenation, and subjective fatigue during normoxia
  and severe poikilocapnic hypoxia. Cocoa flavanols did not improve cognition during
  severe isocapnic hypoxia, suggesting a possible interaction with carbon dioxide.
  ,   We tested the hypothesis that ingestion of cocoa flavanols would improve cognition
  during acute hypoxia equivalent to 5,500 m altitude (partial pressure of end-tidal
  oxygen = 45 mmHg). Using placebo-controlled double-blind trials, 12 participants
  ingested 15 mg·kg −1 of cocoa flavanols 90 min before completing cognitive tasks
  during normoxia and either poikilocapnic or isocapnic hypoxia (partial pressure
  of end-tidal carbon dioxide uncontrolled or maintained at the baseline value, respectively).
  Cerebral oxygenation was measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Overall
  cognition was impaired by poikilocapnic hypoxia (main effect of hypoxia, P = 0.008).
  Cocoa flavanols improved a measure of overall cognitive performance by 4% compared
  with placebo (effect of flavanols, P = 0.033) during hypoxia, indicating a change
  in performance from “low average” to “average.” The hypoxia-induced decrease in
  cerebral oxygenation was two-fold greater with placebo than with cocoa flavanols
  (effect of flavanols, P = 0.005). Subjective fatigue was increased by 900% with
  placebo compared with flavanols during poikilocapnic hypoxia (effect of flavanols,
  P = 0.004). Overall cognition was impaired by isocapnic hypoxia (effect of hypoxia,
  P = 0.001) but was not improved by cocoa flavanols (mean improvement = 1%; effect
  of flavanols, P = 0.72). Reaction time was impaired by 8% with flavanols during
  normoxia and further impaired by 11% during isocapnic hypoxia (effect of flavanols,
  P = 0.01). Our findings are the first to show that flavanol-mediated improvements
  in cognition and mood during normoxia persist during severe oxygen deprivation,
  conferring a neuroprotective effect.  NEW & NOTEWORTHY We show for the first time
  that cocoa flavanols exert a neuroprotective effect during severe hypoxia. Following
  acute cocoa flavanol ingestion, we observed improvements in cognition, cerebral
  oxygenation, and subjective fatigue during normoxia and severe poikilocapnic hypoxia.
  Cocoa flavanols did not improve cognition during severe isocapnic hypoxia, suggesting
  a possible interaction with carbon dioxide.
