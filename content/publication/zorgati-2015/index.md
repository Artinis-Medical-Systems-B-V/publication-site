abstract: "Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare the muscle oxygenation between\
  \ trained and untrained subjects during heavy exercise until exhaustion at two extreme\
  \ pedaling cadences using a NIRS system. Methods: Nine untrained male subjects and\
  \ nine male competitive triathletes cycled until exhaustion at an intensity corresponding\
  \ to 90\_% of the power output achieved at peak oxygen uptake at 40 and 100\_rpm.\
  \ Gas exchanges were measured breath-by-breath during each exercise. Muscle (de)oxygenation\
  \ was monitored continuously by near-infrared spectroscopy on the Vastus Lateralis.\
  \ Results: Muscle deoxygenation (\u2206deoxy[Hb\_+\_Mb], i.e., O2 extraction) and\
  \ \u2206total[Hb\_+\_Mb] were significantly higher at 40\_rpm compared to 100\_\
  rpm during the exercise in untrained subjects but not in triathletes (p\_<\_0.05).\
  \ The time performed until exhaustion was significantly higher at 40 than at 100\_\
  rpm in untrained subjects (373\_\xB1\_55 vs. 234\_\xB1\_37\_s, respectively) but\
  \ not in triathletes (339\_\xB1\_69 vs. 325\_\xB1\_66\_s). Conclusions: These results\
  \ indicate that high aerobic fitness (1) allows for better regulation between V\u02D9\
  O2M and Q\u02D9O2M following the change in pedaling cadence, and (2) is the most\
  \ important factor in the relationship between pedaling cadence and performance."
