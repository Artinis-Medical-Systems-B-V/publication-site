abstract: "Purpose: The present study aimed to determine whether whole-body fat oxidation\
  \ and muscle deoxygenation kinetics parameters during exercise were related in individuals\
  \ with different aerobic fitness levels. Methods: Eleven cyclists [peak oxygen uptake\
  \ ((Formula presented.)): 64.9 \xB1 3.9 mL\u22C5kg\u20131\u22C5min\u20131] and 11\
  \ active individuals ((Formula presented.) : 49.1 \xB1 7.4 mL\u22C5kg\u20131\u22C5\
  min\u20131) performed a maximal incremental cycling test to determine (Formula presented.)\
  \ and a submaximal incremental cycling test to assess whole-body fat oxidation using\
  \ indirect calorimetry and muscle deoxygenation kinetics of the vastus lateralis\
  \ (VL) using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). A sinusoidal (SIN) model was used\
  \ to characterize fat oxidation kinetics and to determine the intensity (Fatmax)\
  \ eliciting maximal fat oxidation (MFO). The muscle deoxygenation response was fitted\
  \ with a double linear model. The slope of the first parts of the kinetics (a1)\
  \ and the breakpoint ([HHb]BP) were determined. Results: MFO (p = 0.01) and absolute\
  \ fat oxidation rates between 20 and 65% (Formula presented.) were higher in cyclists\
  \ than in active participants (p < 0.05), while Fatmax occurred at a higher absolute\
  \ exercise intensity (p = 0.01). a1 was lower in cyclists (p = 0.02) and [HHb]BP\
  \ occurred at a higher absolute intensity (p < 0.001) than in active individuals.\
  \ (Formula presented.) was strongly correlated with MFO, Fatmax, and [HHb]BP (r\
  \ = 0.65\u20130.88, p \u2264 0.001). MFO and Fatmax were both correlated with [HHb]BP\
  \ (r = 0.66, p = 0.01 and r = 0.68, p < 0.001, respectively) and tended to be negatively\
  \ correlated with a1 (r = -0.41, p = 0.06 for both). Conclusion: This study showed\
  \ that whole-body fat oxidation and muscle deoxygenation kinetics were both related\
  \ to aerobic fitness and that a relationship between the two kinetics exists. Individuals\
  \ with greater aerobic fitness may have a delayed reliance on glycolytic metabolism\
  \ at higher exercise intensities because of a longer maintained balance between\
  \ O2 delivery and consumption supporting higher fat oxidation rates."
