abstract: "Purpose: The aim was to compare changes in peripheral and cerebral oxygenation,\
  \ as well as metabolic and performance responses during conditions of blood flow\
  \ restriction (BFR, bilateral vascular occlusion at 0% vs. 45% of resting pulse\
  \ elimination pressure) and systemic hypoxia ($\u223C$ 400\_m, FIO2 20.9% vs. $\u223C\
  $ 3800\_m normobaric hypoxia, FIO2 13.1 \xB1 0.1%) during repeated sprint tests\
  \ to exhaustion (RST) between leg- and arm-cycling exercises. Methods: Seven participants\
  \ (26.6 \xB1 2.9\_years old; 74.0 \xB1 13.1\_kg; 1.76 \xB1 0.09\_m) performed four\
  \ sessions of RST (10-s maximal sprints with 20-s recovery until exhaustion) during\
  \ both leg and arm cycling to measure power output and metabolic equivalents as\
  \ well as oxygenation (near-infrared spectroscopy) of the muscle tissue and prefrontal\
  \ cortex. Results: Mean power output was lower in arms than legs (316 \xB1 118 vs.\
  \ 543 \xB1 127\_W; p < 0.001) and there were no differences between conditions for\
  \ a given limb. Arms demonstrated greater changes in concentration of deoxyhemoglobin\
  \ (\u2206[HHb], \u2212 9.1 \xB1 6.1 vs. \u2212 6.5 \xB1 5.6\_$\u03BC$m) and total\
  \ hemoglobin concentration (\u2206[tHb], 15.0 \xB1 10.8 vs. 11.9 \xB1 7.9\_$\u03BC\
  $m), as well as the absolute maximum tissue saturation index (TSI, 62.0 \xB1 8.3\
  \ vs. 59.3 \xB1 8.1%) than legs, respectively (p < 0.001), demonstrating a greater\
  \ capacity for oxygen extraction. Further, there were greater changes in tissue\
  \ blood volume [tHb] during BFR only compared to all other conditions (p < 0.01\
  \ for all). Conclusions: The combination of BFR and/or hypoxia led to increased\
  \ changes in [HHb] and [tHb] likely due to greater vascular resistance, to which\
  \ arms were more responsive than legs."
