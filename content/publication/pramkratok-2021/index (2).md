abstract: "Pramkratok W, Yimlamai T. Effects of Acute Hypoxia on Psycho-Physiological Response and Muscle Oxygenation during Incremental Running Exercise. JEPonline 2021;24(3):44-54. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of acute hypoxia exposure on physiological and perceptual responses, and muscle oxygenation during maximal incremental running exercise. Seven male elite rugby sevens players volunteered to participate in this study. In a randomized crossover design, the subjects completed two incremental running exercise tests either under normoxia (FiO2 = 20.9%) or after a 3-hr exposure to hypoxia (FiO2 = 14.5%). During both exercise conditions, pulmonary gas exchange was measured using a portable Metamax3B, rating of perceived exertion (RPE) using Borg's (6-20) scale, and muscle oxygenation at the quadriceps using a portable near-infrared spectroscopy. The results indicated that VO2peak, VEpeak, HRpeak, vVO2peak, and time to exhaustion were significantly lower (P<0.05), while the tissue oxyhemoglobin and total hemoglobin were significantly higher (P<0.05) in acute hypoxia than in normoxia. There was no significant difference in RPE scale during maximal exercise between the conditions (P>0.05). In addition, there was a strong positive correlation between RPE and time to exhaustion (r = 0.930) only in normoxia but not in hypoxia, with no correlations observed in other variables in both conditions (P<0.05). The present finding suggests that despite hypoxia-induced higher physiological and metabolic stress during maximal exercise, perceptual response did not differ between the conditions. These findings suggest that RPE scales may be used as a viable method for monitoring and prescribing exercise intensity during exercise, independent of hypoxia."
