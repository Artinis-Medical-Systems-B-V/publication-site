abstract: "Context: Dry cupping therapy is a noninvasive treatment commonly used to\
  \ reduce pain and promote the healing process in various populations, including\
  \ those with nonspecific neck pain; however, no data are available to support most\
  \ of this method's true physiological benefits. Objective: To determine if dry cupping\
  \ therapy decreased pain and increased subcutaneous blood flow compared with sham\
  \ cupping and control conditions. Design: Controlled laboratory study. Setting:\
  \ Laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 32 participants (age \xBC\
  \ 22.5 6 2.8 years, height \xBC 173.3 6 10.1 cm, mass \xBC 76.6 6 18.7 kg) with\
  \ self-reported nonspecific neck pain. Intervention(s): We used dry cupping and\
  \ sham cupping interventions and a control condition. For the dry cupping intervention,\
  \ 1 stationary cup was placed directly over the most painful area for 8 minutes.\
  \ The sham cupping intervention followed the same procedures as the dry cupping\
  \ intervention except a sham cup was applied. For the control condition, participants\
  \ received no treatment. Main Outcome Measure(s): Subjective pain intensity (visual\
  \ analog scale); pain-pressure threshold; subcutaneous hemodynamics, including superficial\
  \ and deep oxygenated, deoxygenated, and total hemoglobin levels; and tissue saturation\
  \ index. Results: We observed differences in the visual analog scale score and the\
  \ superficial and deep oxygenated and total hemoglobin levels (P values \u2264 .002)\
  \ immediately postintervention compared with baseline. Post hoc tests revealed that\
  \ the dry cupping group had less pain than the sham cupping and control groups and\
  \ higher superficial and deep oxygenated and total hemoglobin levels (P values \u2264\
  \ .008). No differences were found between baseline and 24 hours postintervention.\
  \ Conclusions: A single session of dry cupping therapy may be an effective short-term\
  \ treatment method for immediately reducing pain and increasing oxygenated and total\
  \ hemoglobin levels in patients with nonspecific neck pain."
