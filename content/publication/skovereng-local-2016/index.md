abstract: "The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of external\
  \ work rate on joint specific power and the relationship between knee extension\
  \ power and vastus lateralis muscle oxygen consumption (mVO2). We measured kinematics\
  \ and pedal forces and used inverse dynamics to calculate joint power for the hip,\
  \ knee and ankle joints during an incremental cycling protocol performed by 21 recreational\
  \ cyclists. Vastus lateralis mVO2 was estimated using near-infrared spectroscopy\
  \ with an arterial occlusion. The main finding was a non-linear relationship between\
  \ vastus lateralis mVO2 and external work rate that was characterised by an increase\
  \ followed by a tendency for a levelling off (R2=0.99 and 0.94 for the quadratic\
  \ and linear models respectively, p<0.05). When comparing 100 W and 225 W, there\
  \ was a $\u223C$43 W increase in knee extension but still a $\u223C$9% decrease\
  \ in relative contribution of knee extension to external work rate resulting from\
  \ a $\u223C$47 W increase in hip extension. When vastus lateralis mVO2 was related\
  \ to knee extension power, the relationship was still non-linear (R2=0.99 and 0.97\
  \ for the quadratic and linear models respectively, p<0.05). These results demonstrate\
  \ a non-linear response in mVO2 relative to a change in external work rate. Relating\
  \ vastus lateralis mVO2 to knee extension power showed a better fit to a linear\
  \ equation compared to external work rate, but it is not a straight line."
