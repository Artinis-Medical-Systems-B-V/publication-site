abstract: "Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive imaging\
  \ approach for measuring brain activities based on changes in the cerebral concentrations\
  \ of hemoglobin. Recently, statistical analysis based on a general linear model\
  \ (GLM) has become popular. Here, to impose statistical significance on the activation\
  \ detected by fNIRS, family-wise error (FWE) rate control is important. However,\
  \ unlike fMRI, in which measurements are densely sampled on a regular lattice and\
  \ Gaussian smoothing makes the resulting random field homogeneous, the random fields\
  \ from fNIRS are inhomogeneous due to the interpolation from sparsely and irregularly\
  \ distributed optode locations. Thus, tube formula based correction has been proposed\
  \ to address this issue. However, Sun's tube formula cannot be used for general\
  \ random fields such as F-statistics. To overcome these difficulties, we employ\
  \ the expected Euler characteristic approach based on Lipschitz-Killing curvature\
  \ (LKC) to control the family-wise error rate. We compared this correction method\
  \ with Sun's tube formula for t-statistics to confirm the existing method. Based\
  \ on this comparison, we show that covariance estimation should be modified to consider\
  \ channel-wise least-square residual correlation. These new results supplement the\
  \ existing tool of statistical parameter mapping for fNIRS. \xA9 2011 Elsevier B.V.."
