abstract: "The cerebral blood flow (CBF) is an important vital parameter in neurointensive\
  \ care. Currently, there is no non-invasive method for its measurement that can\
  \ easily be applied at the bedside. A new tool to determine CBF is based on near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy (NIRS) applied together with indocyanine green (ICG) dye dilution.\
  \ From a bilateral measurement on selected regions on the head of infrared (IR)\
  \ absorption at various wavelengths during the dilution maneuver, the vascular perfusion\
  \ characteristics of the two brain hemispheres can be determined in terms of mean\
  \ transit time (mtt) of ICG, cerebral blood volume (CBV) and CBF. So far, on nine\
  \ healthy volunteers, NIRS ICG dye dilution bihemispheric measurements were performed,\
  \ which yielded to mtt given as median (range) of 9.3 s (5.1-16.3 s), CBV of 3.5\
  \ ml/100 g (1.7-4.1 ml/100 g), and CBF of 18.2 ml/(100 g\xD7min) [11.1-48.6 ml/(100\
  \ g\xD7min)]. Additionally, the blood flow index (BFI) was calculated with BFI=\
  \ 13.8 mg/(100 g\xD7s) [6.6-15.2 mg/(100 g\xD7s)]. The Spearman rank correlation\
  \ coefficient between CBF and BFI was RS = 0.76. However, as the Bland & Altman\
  \ plot between CBFNIRS and the CBFBFI documents, the limits of agreement are rather\
  \ wide (21.9\xB16.7). Under physiological conditions in healthy volunteers, no differences\
  \ could be detected between the hemispheres. \xA9 2008 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag\
