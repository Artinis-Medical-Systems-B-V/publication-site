abstract: "Introduction: Neural alterations in limbic and prefrontal circuits in association\
  \ with self-injurious behavior have been studied primarily in adult borderline personality\
  \ disorder (BPD). In adolescent patients, research is still sparse. Here, we used\
  \ resting functional near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to examine oxygenation of\
  \ the pre- frontal cortex (PFC) and its association with symptom severity in adolescents\
  \ engaging in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and matched healthy controls (HC).\
  \ Methods: Adolescents (12\u201317 years) with recurrent episodes of NSSI (n = 170)\
  \ and healthy controls (n = 43) performed a low-demanding resting-state vanilla\
  \ baseline task. Mean oxygenation of the PFC and functional connectivity within\
  \ the PFC, were measured using an 8-channel functional NIRS system (Octamon, Artinis,\
  \ The Netherlands). Various clinical variables derived from diagnostic interviews\
  \ and self-reports were included in statistical analyses to explore potential associations\
  \ with PFC oxygenation and connectivity. Results: Adolescents with NSSI showed significantly\
  \ decreased PFC oxygenation compared to HC, as indexed by oxygenated hemoglobin.\
  \ Lower PFC oxygenation was associated with greater adverse childhood experiences\
  \ and less health-related quality of life (HRQoL). While there was no evidence for\
  \ alterations in PFC connectivity in adolescents engaging in NSSI compared to HC,\
  \ increased PFC connectivity in the full sample was associated with greater adverse\
  \ childhood experience, greater BPD pathology, greater depression severity and psychological\
  \ burden in general, as well as lower HRQoL. Conclusion: This study is the first\
  \ to examine PFC oxygenation using NIRS technology in adolescents engaging in NSSI.\
  \ Overall, results indicate small effects not specific to NSSI. Clinical implications\
  \ of these findings and recommendations for further research are discussed."
