abstract: 'This study investigated aerobic metabolism responses in trunk muscles during
  a prolonged trunk extension exercise in athletes and untrained young men. The aim
  was to analyze the adaptations induced by 2 types of sports: one involving intensive
  use of trunk muscles (i. e., judo), and one known to induce high aerobic capacity
  in the whole body (i. e., cycling). Eleven judokas, 10 cyclists and 9 healthy untrained
  young men performed trunk extension exercises on an isokinetic dynamometer. During
  the first session, muscle strength was assessed during maximal trunk extension.
  During a second session, a 5-min exercise was performed to investigate aerobic responses
  with regard to trunk muscles. The near infrared spectroscopy technique and a gas
  exchange analyzer were used continuously to evaluate mechanical efficiency, VO 2
  on-set kinetics, trunk muscle deoxygenation and blood volume. Judokas showed greater
  trunk strength and mechanical efficiency (p<0.05). Cyclists presented faster VO
  2 on-set kinetics (p<0.05) and greater muscle deoxygenation and blood volume compared
  to untrained men (p<0.001). These results suggest that practicing judo improves
  trunk extension efficiency whereas cycling accelerates aerobic pathways and enhances
  microvascular responses to trunk extension exercise. Sport practice improves aerobic
  metabolism responses in trunk extensor muscles differently, according to the training
  specificities.'
