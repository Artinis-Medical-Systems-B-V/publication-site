abstract: "We analysed mean arterial blood pressure, cerebral blood flow velocity,\
  \ oxygenated haemoglobin and deoxygenated haemoglobin signals to estimate dynamic\
  \ cerebral autoregulation. We compared macrovascular (mean arterial blood pressure-cerebral\
  \ blood flow velocity) and microvascular (oxygenated haemoglobin-deoxygenated haemoglobin)\
  \ dynamic cerebral autoregulation estimates during three different conditions: rest,\
  \ mild hypocapnia and hypercapnia. Microvascular dynamic cerebral autoregulation\
  \ estimates were created by introducing the constant time lag plus constant phase\
  \ shift model, which enables correction for transit time, blood flow and blood volume\
  \ oscillations (TT-BF/BV correction). After TT-BF/BV correction, a significant agreement\
  \ between mean arterial blood pressure-cerebral blood flow velocity and oxygenated\
  \ haemoglobin-deoxygenated haemoglobin phase differences in the low frequency band\
  \ was found during rest (left: intraclass correlation=0.6, median phase difference\
  \ 29.5\xB0 vs. 30.7\xB0, right: intraclass correlation=0.56, median phase difference\
  \ 32.6\xB0 vs. 39.8\xB0) and mild hypocapnia (left: intraclass correlation=0.73,\
  \ median phase difference 48.6\xB0 vs. 43.3\xB0, right: intraclass correlation=0.70,\
  \ median phase difference 52.1\xB0 vs. 61.8\xB0). During hypercapnia, the mean transit\
  \ time decreased and blood volume oscillations became much more prominent, except\
  \ for very low frequencies. The transit time related to blood flow oscillations\
  \ was remarkably stable during all conditions. We conclude that non-invasive microvascular\
  \ dynamic cerebral autoregulation estimates are similar to macrovascular dynamic\
  \ cerebral autoregulation estimates, after TT-BF/BV correction is applied. These\
  \ findings may increase the feasibility of non-invasive continuous autoregulation\
  \ monitoring and guided therapy in clinical situations."
