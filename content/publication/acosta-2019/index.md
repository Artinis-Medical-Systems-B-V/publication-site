abstract: "Purpose: Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has recently been proposed as\
  \ an indirect technique to assess brown adipose tissue (BAT) in young men. NIRS\
  \ arises as a novel technique to avoid the limitations of the \u201Cgold-standard\u201D\
  \ 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]DG) positron emission tomography combined\
  \ with X-ray computed tomography (PET/CT). The aim of this study was to examine\
  \ the association between near-infrared spatially resolved spectroscopy (NIRSRS)\
  \ parameters and BAT volume and activity estimated by [18F]DG-PET/CT in 18 young\
  \ healthy women. Procedures: NIRSRS parameters [tissue saturation index and concentrations\
  \ of total haemoglobin, oxy-haemoglobin, and deoxy-haemoglobin] were continuously\
  \ measured in the supraclavicular and forearm regions, in both warm and cold (2\_\
  h of personalised cold exposure) conditions. Then, the NIRSRS data were analysed\
  \ as an average of 5\_min in 4 different periods: (i) warm period as the baseline\
  \ record, (ii) cold period I, (iii) cold period II, and (iv) cold period III. The\
  \ data were then correlated with BAT volume and activity (SUVmean and SUVpeak) estimated\
  \ by [18F]DG-PET/CT. Results: There was no association between the NIRSRS parameters\
  \ in the supraclavicular region in warm conditions (no previous cold exposure) and\
  \ BAT volume and activity (P > 0.05). Similarly, the cold-induced changes of the\
  \ NIRSRS parameters in the supraclavicular region were not associated with BAT volume\
  \ and activity (P > 0.05). Conclusions: NIRSRS does not seem to be a valid technique\
  \ to indirectly assess BAT in young healthy women. Further research is needed to\
  \ validate this technique against other methods such as PET/CT using different radiotracers\
  \ or magnetic resonance imaging."
