abstract: Objective To evaluate the effects of repeated sprint (RS) training in hypoxia
  on aerobic performance, repeated sprint ability (RSA), and muscle oxygenation in
  Rugby Sevens.  Methods Fourteen Rugby Sevens players were randomly allocated into
  hypoxic (RSH, FIO2 = 14.5%, n = 7) or normoxic (RSN, FIO2 = 20.9%, n = 7) groups.
  Both groups underwent RS training consisting of 3 sets of 6-s × 10 sprints at 140%
  of velocity at peak oxygen uptake (vVO2peak) on a motorized treadmill, 3 days/week
  for 6 weeks in addition to usual training. Hematological variables, hypoxia-inducible
  factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentrations
  were measured. Aerobic performance, RSA, and muscle oxygenation during the running-based
  anaerobic sprint (RAS) test were analyzed.  Results RSH caused no changes in hemoglobin
  concentration and hematocrit but significant improvements in VO2peak (7.5%, p = 0.03,
  ES = 1.07), time to exhaustion (17.6%, p = 0.05, ES = 0.92), and fatigue index (FI,
  − 12.3%, p = 0.01, ES = 1.39) during the RSA test compared to baseline but not RSN.
  While ∆deoxygenated hemoglobin was significantly increased both after RSH and RSN
  (p textless 0.05), ∆tissue saturation index (− 56.1%, p = 0.01, ES = 1.35) and ∆oxygenated
  hemoglobin (− 54.7%, p = 0.04, ES = 0.97) were significantly decreased after RSH.
  These changes were concomitant with increased levels of HIF-1α and VEGF in serum
  after RSH with a strong negative correlation between ∆FI and ∆deoxygenated hemoglobin
  after RSH (r = − 0.81, p = 0.03).  Conclusion There was minimal benefit from adding
  RSH to standard Rugby Sevens training, in eliciting improvements in aerobic performance
  and resistance to fatigue, possibly by enhanced muscle deoxygenation and increased
  serum HIF-1α and VEGF concentrations.
