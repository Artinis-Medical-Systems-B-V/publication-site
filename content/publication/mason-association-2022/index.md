abstract: There is an increasing body of evidence suggesting that vascular disease
  could contribute to cognitive decline and overt dementia. Of particular interest
  is atherosclerosis, as it is not only associated with dementia, but could be a potential
  mechanism through which cardiovascular disease directly impacts brain health. In
  this work, we evaluated the differences in functional near infrared spectroscopy
  (fNIRS)-based measures of brain activation, task performance, and the change in
  central hemodynamics (mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR)) during a
  Stroop color-word task in individuals with atherosclerosis, defined as bilateral
  carotid plaques (n = 33) and healthy age-matched controls (n = 33). In the healthy
  control group, the left prefrontal cortex (LPFC) was the only region showing evidence
  of activation when comparing the incongruous with the nominal Stroop test. A smaller
  extent of brain activation was observed in the Plaque group compared with the healthy
  controls (1) globally, as measured by oxygenated hemoglobin (p = 0.036) and (2)
  in the LPFC (p = 0.02) and left sensorimotor cortices (LMC)(p = 0.008) as measured
  by deoxygenated hemoglobin. There were no significant differences in HR, MAP, or
  task performance (both in terms of the time required to complete the task and number
  of errors made) between Plaque and control groups. These results suggest that carotid
  atherosclerosis is associated with altered functional brain activation patterns
  despite no evidence of impaired performance of the Stroop task or central hemodynamic
  changes.
