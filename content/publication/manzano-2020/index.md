abstract: "Cold exposure has been proposed as a potential tool to face obesitysince\
  \ it is able to increase energy expenditure (i.e., cold induced thermogenesis \u2013\
  CIT). This increase is partially mediated by brown adipose tissue (BAT). Nevertheless,\
  \ little is known yet about how CIT (specially its non-shivering component) and\
  \ BATmetabolic activityare regulated, and which are theclinical implicationsof harnessingthem\
  \ in humans. Furthermore, most physiological functions in our organism are under\
  \ the control of the biological clock, which shows a tight link with disease in\
  \ humans. However, to date it remains unknown whether CIT and BAT activity follow\
  \ a diurnal/circadian rhythmicity, and whether they are related to the general functioning\
  \ of the circadian system. Furthermore, whether exercise and physical activity are\
  \ efficient strategies to recruit and activate BATstill needto be explored.Therefore,\
  \ theoverall aim of the present Doctoral Thesis wasto studythe role of cold and\
  \ the biological clock on energy balance in humans as well ason BAT; and toinvestigate\
  \ whether exercise and physical activity could be potential strategiesto recruit\
  \ and activate BATin humans. Mild cold elicits a modest increase in CIT and prompts\
  \ a fat oxidative metabolism, especially during the initial moments of cold exposure\
  \ (Study I).In addition,subjectsexposed to the coldest ambient temperature during\
  \ their daily life have 3-5 times more BAT volume and activity-measured as 18F-fluordeoxygelucose\
  \ (18F-FDG) uptake -compared to subjects who are exposed to a warmer ambient temperature\
  \ (Study II). CIT and BAT 18F-FDG uptake do not seem to have diurnal variations\
  \ (Study III), and the relationship between the daily rhythm of distal skin temperature-an\
  \ overall indicator of the circadian system functioning-and BAT 18F-FDG uptake,\
  \ is masked by the environmental temperature (Study II). In addition, sleepduration\
  \ and qualityare not related to human BAT metabolic activity (Study IV). Anacutebout\
  \ ofaerobic exercise does not induce significant changes in the protein concentrations\
  \ of UCP-1 (and therefore BAT activity) in mice (Study V). Accordingly, physicalactivity\
  \ levels and sedentary time are not related to BAT 18F-FDG uptake in young human\
  \ adults (Study VI), neither to the regulation of browning markers, suggesting a\
  \ negligible role for exercise and physical activity as potential strategies to\
  \ recruit and activate human BAT. The results from the present Doctoral Thesisincrease\
  \ our knowledge on the effects of cold on energyand BATmetabolism in humans, and\
  \ on how the biological clock and related factors might affect them. In addition,\
  \ it provides novel information on the search of potential strategies to improve\
  \ BATfunction and browning of specific adipose depots."
