abstract: In the era of an expected increase in the presence of autonomous systems,
  in industrial settings, the need to develop intelligent interfaces for human workers
  is gaining attention. Worker mistrust and stress result because autonomous systems
  don’t provide any facial, auditory, or visual cues which workers normally use to
  predict behaviour. The seamless integration of humans with autonomous systems is
  not possible without intelligent industrial robots which can act in unforeseen situations,
  based on the information about collaborative humans and the environment. It is important
  to quantify human workers’ frustration, intention, and cognitive stress, not only
  for performance improvement but also to fulfil the integration requirements of autonomous
  systems on factory floors. This study aims to offer a seamless, real-time monitoring
  solution for cognitive stress and fatigue of human workers in production and logistics
  scenarios. An experiment mimicking the actual factory scenario has been designed
  to assess and quantify the cognitive stress of participants using physiological,
  behavioural, and subjective measures. The data is trained using machine learning
  to develop stress categorisation in the form of a stress scale that has the potential
  to become a solution in contemporary industrial and logistics sectors. Two Android
  applications have been developed. The first application focuses on the stress management
  and monitoring of factory workers using physiological and subjective data to provide
  a quantified form of stress for the users and managers. The second application targets
  drivers in logistics setups and aims to detect the emotions of drivers in real-time.
  This is a useful application for drivers that can provide precautionary alerts to
  prevent accidents due to the fatigued state of the driver. Holistically, this research
  has the potential to optimise the interface between humans and interacting autonomous
  systems and develop innovative solutions to improve workplace health and safety
  hence enhancing productivity across various occupational settings.
