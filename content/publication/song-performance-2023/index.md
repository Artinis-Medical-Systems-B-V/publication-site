abstract: Collaborative innovation in interdisciplinary teams is a collaborative approach
  to accomplish cooperative tasks and achieve innovative goals through a multidisciplinary
  intersection in the form of member combinations. The purpose of this study was to
  reveal the neural mechanisms underlying the impact of interdisciplinary collaboration
  on groups and individuals. Each group of subjects consisted of two people with and
  without a design background, who were asked to solve two realistic presented problems
  (RPP), and two design innovation tasks based on RPP adaptations. The study used
  hyperscanning of functional near-infrared spectroscopic (fNIRS) brain functional
  imaging techniques to simultaneously record the neural responses of interacting
  participants in each group. The study compared the innovation performance of interdisciplinary
  teams with design backgrounds in domain-specific versus domain-general innovation
  tasks, and the results showed differences in individual and group performance in
  different types of innovation tasks, with individual fluency being the most significant.
  The study may provide empirical evidence for the performance benefits of interdisciplinary
  teams in real-world collaborative co-innovation.
