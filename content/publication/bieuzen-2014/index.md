abstract: 'The objective of this study was to test how low-frequency electrical stimulation
  (LFES; Veinoplus Sport (AdRem Technology, Paris, France)) of the calf muscles affects
  recovery indices compared with 2 other commonly used recovery methods (active, ACT;
  passive, PAS). The tests used assessed predominantly anaerobic performance after
  short-term (15 min) recovery, and the kinetics of blood markers. Fourteen highly
  trained female handball players completed 2 Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery tests (level
  2; YYIR2) separated by a 15-min recovery period. During recovery, 1 of 3 recovery
  methods (ACT, LFES or PAS) was randomly selected. Performance (i.e., distance run)
  was measured at the end of each YYIR2 test. Blood lactate, pH, bicarbonate concentrations,
  heart rate, respiratory gas exchange and tissue saturation index for the lateral
  gastrocnemius were recorded. LFES showed a very likely beneficial effect on performance
  during the second YYIR2 relative to PAS and a possible beneficial effect relative
  to ACT (distance Pre vs. Post; LFES: -1.8%; ACT: -7.6%; PAS: -15.9%). Compared with
  PAS recovery, LFES and ACT recovery clearly showed a faster return to baseline for
  blood lactate, pH and bicarbonate concentrations during the recovery period. LFES
  of the calf muscles and, to a lesser extent, ACT recovery appear to effectively
  improve short-term recovery between 2 bouts of exhausting exercises. These methods
  could be of benefit if applied during half-time, for sports involving successive
  rounds, or where only a limited recovery period is available.'
