abstract: "The presence of hypertension in middle-age is a major risk factor for later-life\
  \ development of cognitive and cardiovascular disease. Exercise is widely recommended\
  \ to combat vascular and brain aging in hypertension. We sought to compare the effects\
  \ of a single bout of aerobic exercise on 1) arterial stiffness and cerebral hemodynamics\
  \ and 2) cognitive function in middle-aged adults with controlled-hypertension and\
  \ without hypertension. Vascular and cognitive measures were assessed pre and post\
  \ 30-min of aerobic exercise at \u224855% maximal oxygen consumption. Arterial stiffness\
  \ and cerebral hemodynamics were measured non-invasively. Cognitive function was\
  \ measured using a computerized testing battery that included executive function\
  \ and memory tasks. Acute aerobic exercise resulted in similar 1) increases in arterial\
  \ stiffness and cerebral hemodynamic pulsatility, and 2) accelerated executive function\
  \ and memory reaction time post-exercise in adults with and without hypertension.\
  \ Based on these results, we investigated if adults with hypertension had differential\
  \ vascular contributions to cognitive activity. We measured cerebrovascular hemodynamics\
  \ non-invasively during cognitive activity as a measure of neurovascular coupling.\
  \ Adults with and without hypertension exhibit similar increases in large artery\
  \ stiffness and decreases in extracranial hemodynamic pulsatility during cognitive\
  \ activity, indicating similar neurovascular coupling between groups. In conclusion,\
  \ these data indicate that middle-aged adults with controlled-hypertension experience\
  \ similar 1) vascular responses to acute exercise and cognitive activity, and 2)\
  \ beneficial changes in cognitive function following acute exercise as their counterparts\
  \ without hypertension. Our results will be interpreted and explored in the context\
  \ of hypertension severity and underscore the importance of optimal blood pressure\
  \ control."
