abstract: "The literature contains limited evidence on how our brains control eccentric\
  \ movement. A higher activation is expected in the contralateral motor cortex (M1)\
  \ but consensus has not yet been reached. Therefore, the present study aimed to\
  \ compare patterns of M1 activation between eccentric and concentric movements.\
  \ Nine healthy participants performed in a randomized order three sets of \uFB01\
  ve repetitions of eccentric or concentric movement with the dominant elbow \uFB02\
  exors over a range of motion of 60\u25E6 at two velocities (30\u25E6/s and 60\u25E6\
  /s). The tests were carried out using a Biodex isokinetic dynamometer with the forearm\
  \ supported in the horizontal plane. The peak torque values were not signi\uFB01\
  cantly different between concentric and eccentric movements (p = 0.42). Hemodynamic\
  \ responses of the contralateral and ipsilateral M1 were measured with a near-infrared\
  \ spectroscopy system (Oxymon MkIII, Artinis). A higher contralateral M1 activity\
  \ was found during eccentric movements (p = 0.04, $\u03B7$2 = 0.47) and at the velocity\
  \ of 30\u25E6/s (p = 0.039, $\u03B7$2 = 0.48). These preliminary \uFB01ndings indicate\
  \ a speci\uFB01c control mechanism in the contralateral M1 to produce eccentric\
  \ muscle actions at the angular velocities investigated, although the role of other\
  \ brain areas in the motor control network cannot be excluded."
