abstract: The aim of this work was to critically assess if functional near infrared
  spectroscopy (fNIRS) can be profitably used as a tool for noninvasive recording
  of brain functions and emotions in sheep. We considered an experimental design including
  advances in instrumentation (customized wireless multi-distance fNIRS system), more
  accurate physical modelling (two-layer model for photon diffusion and 3D Monte Carlo
  simulations), support from neuroanatomical tools (positioning of the fNIRS probe
  by MRI and DTI data of the very same animals), and rigorous protocols (motor task,
  startling test) for testing the behavioral response of freely moving sheep. Almost
  no hemodynamic response was found in the extra-cerebral region in both the motor
  task and the startling test. In the motor task, as expected we found a canonical
  hemodynamic response in the cerebral region when sheep were walking. In the startling
  test, the measured hemodynamic response in the cerebral region was mainly from movement.
  Overall, these results indicate that with the current setup and probe positioning
  we are primarily measuring the motor area of the sheep brain, and not probing the
  too deeply located cortical areas related to processing of emotions.
