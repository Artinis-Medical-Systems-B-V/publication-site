abstract: 'Background: In sports medicine, near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is used
  to measure physiologic parameters of muscle function, and quantify the effects of
  exercise. Firstline treatment for urinary incontinence (UI) involves pelvic floor
  muscle (PFM) rehabilitation therapy (PFMT), but currently oxygen kinetic measures
  to quantify training effect are lacking. Methods: Half-recovery time of hemoglobin
  difference, HbDiff(&frac12;RT), following sustained maximal voluntary contraction
  (SMVC), is a validated, NIRS-derived, oxygen kinetic parameter used in exercise
  science and healthcare monitoring, shown previously to be applicable to the PFM
  in healthy women using a transvaginal NIRS interface. We evaluated if a PFMT training
  effect could be detected using HbDiff(&frac12;RT) measurement in symptomatic women
  with UI. Results: HbDiff(&frac12;RT) data sets were obtained from 7 symptomatic
  women prior to and following an 8-week, homebased PFMT regimen; these were compared
  in each individual and with data from 11 asymptomatic controls. A post training
  treatment effect was evident where HbDiff(&frac12;RT) shortened, indicating improved
  PFM metabolic function. Discussion: PFM NIRS monitoring proved feasible in a heterogeneous
  group of women with UI, provided a quantifiable kinetic parameter, and proved more
  comfortable than conventional perineal pressure measurements (perineometry). Importantly,
  in one subject with UI due to an incomplete spinal cord lesion, and no detectable
  PFM contractile ability on initial assessment, NIRS enabled a post-PFMT improvement
  to be detected using PFM oxygen kinetics. Conclusions: Calculation of HbDiff(&frac12;RT)
  following PFM SMVC allows a validated muscle reoxygenation parameter to be applied
  in evaluation of PFM dysfunction, and to measure training effect from rehabilitation
  exercise, potentially improving management of UI.'
