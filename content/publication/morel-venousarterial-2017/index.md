abstract: "The venous\u2013arterial difference in CO2 ($\u0394$CO2) has been proposed\
  \ as an index of the adequacy of tissue perfusion in shock states. We hypothesized\
  \ that the variation in PaCO2 (hyper- or hypocapnia) could impact $\u0394$CO2, partly\
  \ through microcirculation adaptations. Fifteen healthy males volunteered to participate.\
  \ For hypocapnia condition (hCO2), the subjects were asked to hyperventilate, while\
  \ they were asked to breathe a gas mixture containing 8\_% CO2 for hypercapnia condition\
  \ (HCO2). The 2 conditions were randomly assigned. Blood gases were measured at\
  \ baseline before each condition, and after 5\u20137\_min of either hCO2 or HCO2\
  \ condition. Microcirculation was assessed by the muscle reoxygenation slope measured\
  \ with near infrared spectroscopy following a vascular occlusion test and by skin\
  \ circulation with in vivo reflectance confocal microscopy. $\u0394$CO2 was significantly\
  \ increased with hCO2 while it tended to decrease with HCO2 (non-significant). HCO2\
  \ induced a moderate increase of the resaturation slope of NIRS oxygenation. Skin\
  \ microcirculatory blood flow significantly dropped with hCO2, while it remained\
  \ unchanged with hypercapnia. Our results warrant cautious interpretation of $\u0394\
  $CO2 as an indicator of tissue perfusion during respiratory alkalosis."
