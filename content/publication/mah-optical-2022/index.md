abstract: 'The worldwide outbreak of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has highlighted
  the need for a screening and monitoring system for infectious respiratory diseases
  in the acute and chronic phase. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility
  of using a wearable near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) sensor to collect respiratory
  signals and distinguish between normal and simulated pathological breathing. Twenty-one
  healthy adults participated in an experiment that examined five separate breathing
  conditions. Respiratory signals were collected with a continuous-wave NIRS sensor
  (PortaLite, Artinis Medical Systems) affixed over the sternal manubrium. Following
  a three-minute baseline, participants began five minutes of imposed difficult breathing
  using a respiratory trainer. After a five minute recovery period, participants began
  five minutes of imposed rapid and shallow breathing. The study concluded with five
  additional minutes of regular breathing. NIRS signals were analyzed using a machine
  learning model to distinguish between normal and simulated pathological breathing.
  Three features: breathing interval, breathing depth, and O2Hb signal amplitude were
  extracted from the NIRS data and, when used together, resulted in a weighted average
  accuracy of 0.87. This study demonstrated that a wearable NIRS sensor can monitor
  respiratory patterns continuously and non-invasively and we identified three respiratory
  features that can distinguish between normal and simulated pathological breathing.'
