abstract: "Beetroot juice (BJ) consumption has been associated with improved cardiovascular\
  \ health owing to an increase in NO bioconversion. This study evaluates the effect\
  \ of BJ consumption on macrovascular endothelial function (flow-mediated dilation\
  \ (FMD)) and muscle oxygen saturation (StO2) parameters in pregnant women within\
  \ a randomised, crossover, double-blind design in which twelve pregnant women consumed\
  \ a single dose (140 ml) of BJ or placebo (PLA). Urinary nitrate was assessed before\
  \ (T0) and 150 min after BJ/PLA consumption. FMD was used to evaluate macrovascular\
  \ endothelial function, and near-IR spectroscopy was used to evaluate muscle StO2\
  \ parameters during the occlusion and reperfusion phases, which were taken at baseline\
  \ (PRE) and 120 and 140 min after BJ/PLA consumption, respectively. A significant\
  \ increase in urinary nitrate was observed at 150 min after BJ consumption when\
  \ compared with T0 (BJ: 0\u02D920 (sd 0\u02D913) v. T0: 0\u02D902 (sd 0\u02D900),\
  \ P=0\u02D9000) and PLA intervention (PLA: 0\u02D902 (sd 0\u02D900), P=0\u02D9001).\
  \ FMD improved after BJ consumption when compared with PRE (BJ: 11\u02D900 (sd 1\u02D9\
  67) v. PRE: 5\u02D953 (sd 1\u02D917), P=0\u02D9000) and PLA (5\u02D934 (sd 1\u02D9\
  31), P=0\u02D9000). No significant difference between PLA and PRE in FMD (P=1\u02D9\
  000) was observed. In StO2 parameters, a difference was not observed after BJ consumption\
  \ compared with PRE and PLA intervention. The data demonstrate that a single dose\
  \ of 140 ml of BJ consumption improves macrovascular endothelial function, but not\
  \ StO2 parameters."
