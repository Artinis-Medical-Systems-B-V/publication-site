 abstract = {Beetroot juice (BJ) consumption has been associated with improved cardiovascular health owing to an increase in NO bioconversion. This study evaluates the effect of BJ consumption on macrovascular endothelial function (flow-mediated dilation (FMD)) and muscle oxygen saturation (StO2) parameters in pregnant women within a randomised, crossover, double-blind design in which twelve pregnant women consumed a single dose (140 ml) of BJ or placebo (PLA). Urinary nitrate was assessed before (T0) and 150 min after BJ/PLA consumption. FMD was used to evaluate macrovascular endothelial function, and near-IR spectroscopy was used to evaluate muscle StO2 parameters during the occlusion and reperfusion phases, which were taken at baseline (PRE) and 120 and 140 min after BJ/PLA consumption, respectively. A significant increase in urinary nitrate was observed at 150 min after BJ consumption when compared with T0 (BJ: 0˙20 (sd 0˙13) v. T0: 0˙02 (sd 0˙00), P=0˙000) and PLA intervention (PLA: 0˙02 (sd 0˙00), P=0˙001). FMD improved after BJ consumption when compared with PRE (BJ: 11˙00 (sd 1˙67) v. PRE: 5˙53 (sd 1˙17), P=0˙000) and PLA (5˙34 (sd 1˙31), P=0˙000). No significant difference between PLA and PRE in FMD (P=1˙000) was observed. In StO2 parameters, a difference was not observed after BJ consumption compared with PRE and PLA intervention. The data demonstrate that a single dose of 140 ml of BJ consumption improves macrovascular endothelial function, but not StO2 parameters.},
