abstract: "Near-infrared spectroscopy has been applied to the study of cerebral oxygenation\
  \ and hemodynamics in the newborn. Fetal Hb is present in high concentrations in\
  \ these infants. Because spectral absorption curves in the near-infrared range for\
  \ fetal Hb are not identical to those for adult Hb, there is a potential for the\
  \ measurements to be affected. This possibility has not previously been investigated.\
  \ A quantitative analysis of cerebral oxygenation was undertaken in six newborn\
  \ infants. The analysis used near-infrared spectroscopy multiplier coefficients\
  \ derived from the absorption coefficients of both fetal and adult deoxygenated\
  \ and oxygenated Hb. The results of both analyses were compared. It was concluded\
  \ that the error in near-infrared spectroscopy analysis of neonatal cerebral oxygenation\
  \ arising from the use of absorption coefficients derived from adult Hb is inconsequential,\
  \ even in the presence of high concentrations of fetal Hb. \xA9 1993 International\
