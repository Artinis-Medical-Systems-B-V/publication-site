abstract: "This study tested the hypothesis that muscle blood flow restriction reduces\
  \ muscle and cerebral oxygenation, at rest. In 26 healthy males, aged 33\xB12 yrs,\
  \ physiological variables were continuously recorded during a 10-min period in two\
  \ experimental conditions: a) with muscle blood flow restriction through thigh cuffs\
  \ application inflated at 120 mmHg (With Cuffs, WC) and b) without restriction (No\
  \ Cuffs, NC). Muscle and cerebral oxygenation were reduced by muscle blood flow\
  \ restriction as suggested by the increase in both muscle and cerebral deoxygenated\
  \ hemoglobin ($\u0394$[HHb]; p<0.01) and the decrease of muscle and cerebral oxygenation\
  \ index ($\u0394$[HbDiff]; p<0.01). Hemodynamic responses were not affected by such\
  \ muscle blood flow restriction, whereas baroreflex sensitivity was reduced (p=0.009).\
  \ The perception of leg discomfort was higher (p<0.001) in the WC than in the NC\
  \ condition. This study suggests that thigh cuffs application inflated at 120 mmHg\
  \ is an effective method to reduce muscle oxygenation at rest. These changes at\
  \ the muscular level seem to be sensed by the central nervous system, evoking alterations\
  \ in cerebral oxygenation and baroreflex sensitivity. Novelty bullets: \u2022 Thigh\
  \ cuffs application inflated at 120 mmHg effectively reduces muscle oxygenation\
  \ at rest. \u2022 Limiting muscle oxygenation appears to reduce cerebral oxygenation,\
  \ and baroreflex sensitivity, at rest. \u2022 Even in healthy subjects, limiting\
  \ muscle oxygenation, at rest, affects neural integration."
