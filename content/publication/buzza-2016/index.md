abstract: "Purpose: Aerobic endurance training (ET) increases systemic and peripheral\
  \ oxygen utilisation over time, the adaptation pattern not being linear. However,\
  \ the timing and mechanisms of changes in oxygen utilisation, associated with training\
  \ beyond one year are not known. This study tested the hypothesis that in women\
  \ aged 40-60 years performing the same current training load; systemic O2 utilisation\
  \ (VO2) and tissue deoxyhaemoglobin (HHb) in the Vastus Lateralis (VL) and Gastrocnemius\
  \ (GAST) would be higher in long term trained (LTT; > 5 yr) compared to a short\
  \ term trained (STT; 6-24 months) participants during ramp incremental (RI) cycling,\
  \ but similar during square-wave constant load (SWCL) cycling performed at the same\
  \ relative intensity (below ventilatory turn point [VTP]); and that pre-frontal\
  \ cortex (PFC) HHb would be similar between participant groups in both exercise\
  \ conditions. Methods: Thirteen STT and 13 LTT participants performed RI and SWCL\
  \ conditions on separate days. VO2, and VL, GAST, and PFC HHb were measured simultaneously.\
  \ Results: VO2peak was higher in LTT compared to STT, and VO2 was higher in LTT\
  \ at each relative intensities of 25%, 80% and 90% of VTP in SWCL. HHb in the VL\
  \ was significantly higher in LTT compared to STT at peak exercise (4.54 \xB1 3.82\
  \ vs 1.55 \xB1 2.33 $\u03BC$M), and at 25% (0.99 \xB1 1.43 vs 0.04 \xB10.96 $\u03BC\
  $M), 80% (3.19 \xB12.93 vs 1.14 \xB1 1.82 $\u03BC$M) and 90% (4.62 \xB13.12 vs 2.07\
  \ \xB1 2.49 $\u03BC$M) of VTP in SWCL. Conclusions: The additional (12.9 \xB1 9.3)\
  \ years of ET in LTT, resulted in higher VO2, and HHb in the VL at peak exercise,\
  \ and sub-VTP exercise. These results indicate that in women 40-60 years old, systemic\
  \ and muscle O2 utilisation continues to improve with ET beyond two years."
