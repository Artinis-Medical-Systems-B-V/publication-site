abstract: Unlike general e-commerce, live streaming commerce innovatively allows live
  streamers to use instant social functions to communicate with viewers and present
  products in a more vivid way. However, little research has been done to understand
  the effects of multiple information cues in live streaming commerce. Drawing on
  the stimulus–organism–response (S–O–R) theory, we develop a two-phase research framework
  to examine how the combination of endogenous and exogenous cues can influence viewers’
  information processing and arouse purchase intention when watching e-commerce live
  streaming. We also propose that product involvement may moderate the effects of
  information cues. To investigate the above effects, we conduct a laboratory experiment
  using self-report and functional near-infrared spectroscopy. In summary, the experimental
  results show that the richer the cues provided by the live streaming, the better
  the effect on viewers’ product knowledge accessibility for low-involvement products.
  However, complex information cues have a negative effect on the viewers’ cognitive
  processing of high-involvement products, which may distract viewers’ attention from
  the products and reduce consumers’ product knowledge accessibility. In addition,
  the introduction of the live streamer, the real-time comments, and the detailed
  product list aroused the viewers' positive emotions among the viewers and thus stimulated
  their purchase intention. These findings can help platforms, businesses, and live
  streamers improve their marketing strategies.
