abstract: "Blood flow (BF) in exercising muscles is an important factor for exercise\
  \ capacity. Recently, a non-invasive method to estimate capillary BF (Qcap) was\
  \ introduced. Using this method, the Fick principle is re-arranged by using relative\
  \ differences in deoxygenated haemoglobin ($\u0394$HHb) as a surrogate for arteriovenous\
  \ O2 difference and pulmonary oxygen uptake (VO2) instead of muscular oxygen uptake.\
  \ The aim of this study was to examine (I) the relationship between Qcap and exercise\
  \ intensity during and following exercise, and (II) to critically reflect the Qcap\
  \ approach. Seventeen male subjects completed six bouts of cycling exercise with\
  \ different exercise intensities (40\u201390% peak oxygen uptake, VO2peak) in randomized\
  \ order. VO2 and $\u0394$HHb were monitored continuously during the trail. Qcap\
  \ was modelled bi-exponentially, and mean response time (MRT) was calculated during\
  \ recovery as well as the dissociation of modelled VO2 and Qcap recovery kinetics\
  \ (MRT/$\u03C4$VO2). End-exercise Qcap increased continuously with exercise intensity.\
  \ This also applied to MRT. Postexercise MRT/$\u03C4$VO2 increased from 40 to 60%\
  \ VO2peak but remained stable thereafter. The results show that Qcap response to\
  \ exercise is linearly related to exercise intensity. This is presumably due to\
  \ vasoactive factors like shear-stress or endothelial-mediated vasodilation. MRT/$\u03C4\
  $VO2 shows that postexercise Qcap is elevated for a longer period than VO2, which\
  \ is representative for metabolic demand following exercise \u226570% VO2peak. This\
  \ is a hint for prolonged local vasodilation. According to previous studies, Qcap\
  \ could not be modelled properly in some cases, which is a limitation to the method\
  \ and therefore has to be interpreted with caution."
