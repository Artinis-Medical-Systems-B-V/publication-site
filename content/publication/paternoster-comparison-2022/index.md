abstract: 'Continuous-wave near-infrared spectroscopy (CW-NIRS) is a method used to
  non-invasively estimate skeletal muscle oxygen consumption (mVO2). Three different
  signals are provided by CW-NIRS devices: (1) oxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb); (2) deoxygenated
  hemoglobin (HHb); and (3) tissue saturation index (TSI). Typically, the signal’s
  slope is interpreted with respect to high or low mVO2 during a muscle action. What
  signal (or combination of signals) is used for slope interpretation differs according
  to what approach is used, and there are several published in literature. It is unclear
  if resulting mVO2 estimates can be used interchangeably. Hence, this work aimed
  to compare five commonly used approaches on the same set of CW-NIRS data regarding
  their agreement in estimated mVO2. A controlled, lab-based study setting was used
  for this experiment. Data are based on isometric dorsiflexion contractions of 15
  subjects at 30% of voluntary maximum torque, at two different ankle angles. CW-NIRS
  was placed on the m. tibialis anterior and blood flow was occluded. The approaches
  for mVO2 estimation included calculations based on (1) TSI, (2) the difference between
  O2Hb and HHb (Hbdiff), (3) the mean of slopes from O2Hb and HHb (Hbmean), (4) the
  HHb signal, and (5) the O2Hb signal. Linear regression modelling was used to calculate
  respective slopes (r2 textgreater 0.99). Repeated measures ANOVA identified significant
  differences between the approaches (p textless 0.001, ω2 = 0.258). Post-hoc tests
  revealed that only TSI vs. Hbmean and Hbdiff vs. HHb gave comparable results (p
  textgreater 0.271). In addition, Bland–Altman plots showed good accuracy (mean bias
  ~2%) but low precision (±20%) between the comparisons. Thus, the different approaches
  to estimate mVO2 cannot be used interchangeably. The results from different studies
  using different approaches should be compared with caution.'
