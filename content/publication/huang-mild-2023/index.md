abstract: Abstract  Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are at a high risk
  of developing future dementia. However, early identification and active intervention
  could potentially reduce its morbidity and the incidence of dementia. Functional
  near‐infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has been proposed as a noninvasive modality for
  detecting oxygenation changes in the time‐varying hemodynamics of the prefrontal
  cortex. This study sought to provide an effective method for detecting patients
  with MCI using fNIRS and the Wisconsin card sorting test (WCST) to evaluate changes
  in blood oxygenation. The results revealed that all groups with a lower mini‐mental
  state examination grade had a higher increase in HHb concentration during a modified
  WCST (MCST). The increase in the change in oxygenated hemoglobin concentration in
  the stroke group was smaller than that in the normal group due to weak cerebrovascular
  reactivity.
