Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are at a high risk of developing future dementia. However, early identification and active intervention could potentially reduce its morbidity and the incidence of dementia. Functional near‐infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has been proposed as a noninvasive modality for detecting oxygenation changes in the time‐varying hemodynamics of the prefrontal cortex. This study sought to provide an effective method for detecting patients with MCI using fNIRS and the Wisconsin card sorting test (WCST) to evaluate changes in blood oxygenation. The results revealed that all groups with a lower mini‐mental state examination grade had a higher increase in HHb concentration during a modified WCST (MCST). The increase in the change in oxygenated hemoglobin concentration in the stroke group was smaller than that in the normal group due to weak cerebrovascular reactivity.},
