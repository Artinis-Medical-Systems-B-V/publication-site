abstract: "Background: Clinicians typically rely on neuropsychological and balance\
  \ tests to track concussion recovery. The aforementioned tests imply impairments\
  \ that are based on performance, but these tests do not directly measure brain physiology\
  \ throughout concussion recovery. Because of these issues, an objective biomarker\
  \ that can index severity and the recovery timeline is needed. Moreover, the number\
  \ of concussions occurring at a recreational level requires the biomarker to be\
  \ easily administered in a cost effective manner, and the results easily interpreted.\
  \ Methods: To address these issues, near-infrared spectroscopy was used to assess\
  \ the relative changes in oxy (HbO2)- and deoxyhaemoglobin and the associated standard\
  \ deviations (SD) in the prefrontal cortex. Resting haemoglobin, and haemoglobin\
  \ changes in response to hypercapnia (five repeated 20s breath holds), was measured\
  \ in all participants. Data were aggregated into healthy baselines (n\_=\_115),\
  \ and concussed participants on days 1\u20133 (n\_=\_14), 4\u20136 (n\_=\_8), and\
  \ 7\u201314 (n\_=\_11). The data were statistically compared using a 1\_\xD7\_4\
  \ ANOVA. Results: Resting HbO2 values progressively lowered from days 1\u20133 to\
  \ 7\u201314 (with no differences compared to controls). The second major finding\
  \ showed that hypercapnic HbO2 SD was significantly lower than resting values on\
  \ days 1\u20133 and 4\u20136, but reversed back towards the healthy control group\
  \ on day 7\u201314. Conclusion: Monitoring cerebral oxygenation changes is a viable\
  \ biomarker to assess the physiological state of the brain following concussion."
