abstract: "Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS; continuous wave type) is a noninvasive\
  \ tool for detecting the relative change of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin. To\
  \ make this change, intervention methods must be applied. This study determined\
  \ the hemodynamics of 44\_healthy participants and 35 patients with sepsis during\
  \ exposure to FIR as a novel physical intervention approach. Local microcirculation\
  \ of their brachioradialis was monitored during exposure and recovery through NIRS.\
  \ The variations in blood flow and microvascular reaction were determined by conducting\
  \ paired and unpaired t tests. The oxyhemoglobin levels of the healthy participants\
  \ increased continuously, even during recovery. In contrast to expextations, the\
  \ oxyhemoglobin levels of the patients plateaued after only 5\_min of FIR illumination.\
  \ The proposed method has potential applications for ensuring efficient treatment\
  \ and facilitating doctors in diagnosing the functions of vessels in intensive care\
  \ units. (Figure presented.) Mapping diagrams of HbO2 in healthy males and males\
  \ with sepsis illustrated unique scenarios during the process."
