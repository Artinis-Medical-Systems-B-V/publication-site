abstract: Introduction and Objectives Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
  (IPF) present respiratory derangements at rest and during exercise, accompanied
  by exercise intolerance. Some patients may develop profound exertional desaturation
  even without resting hypoxemia. Evidence suggests the involvement of reduced cerebral-oxygenation
  in exercise intolerance. We aimed to examine (i) differences in cerebral-oxygenation
  during exercise between IPF patients with and without isolated exertional desaturation,
  (ii) whether the impairments in cerebral-oxygenation are detected at similar exercise
  intensity, and (iii) correlations between cerebral-oxygenation indices, disease
  severity, and 6-min walk test (6MWT).  Materials and Methods Patients with IPF (n
  = 24; 62.1 ± 9.3 years) without resting hypoxemia underwent cardiopulmonary exercise
  testing (CPET) with cerebral-oxygenation monitoring via near-infrared-spectroscopy
  (NIRS). Βased on their pulse-oxymetry saturation (SpO2) during CPET, patients were
  divided into the “exertional-desaturators” group (SpO2nadir≤89% and ≥6% drop in
  SpO2) and the “non-exertional-desaturators” group (SpO2nadir≥90% and ≤5% drop).  Results
  During CPET, the “exertional-desaturators” group exhibited lower oxygenated-hemoglobin
  (-0.67 ± 1.48 vs. 0.69 ± 1.75 μmol/l; p textless 0.05) and higher deoxygenated-hemoglobin
  (1.67 ± 1.13 vs. 0.17 ± 0.62 μmol/l; p textless 0.001) than the “non-exertional-desaturators”
  group. A different pattern (p textless 0.01) in cerebral-oxygenation responses was
  observed in the two groups. In exertional-desaturators oxygenated-hemoglobin declined
  below baseline even at low/moderate-intensity exercise (p textless 0.05), whereas,
  in non-exertional-desaturators cerebral-oxygenation declined (p textless 0.05) at
  high-intensity exercise. Cerebral-NIRS indices correlated (p textless 0.05) with
  CPET-duration, dyspnea, diffusion capacity, and 6MWT.  Conclusions During incremental
  exercise, patients with IPF and exertional desaturation present a significant decline
  in cerebral-oxygenation even during low-intensity exercise. Our findings support
  the implementation of longer-duration rehabilitation programs in IPF so that lower
  intensity exercise can be applied at the initial stages. (NCT 03683082)
