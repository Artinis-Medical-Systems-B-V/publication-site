abstract: "This study examined the influence of muscle deoxygenation and reoxygenation\
  \ on repeated-sprint performance via manipulation of O2 delivery. Fourteen team-sport\
  \ players performed 10 10-s sprints (30-s recovery) under normoxic (NM: FIO2 0.21)\
  \ and acute hypoxic (HY: FIO2 0.13) conditions in a randomized, single-blind fashion\
  \ and crossover design. Mechanical work was calculated and arterial O2 saturation\
  \ (SpO2) was estimated via pulse oximetry for every sprint. Muscle deoxyhemoglobin\
  \ concentration ([HHb]) was monitored continuously by near-infrared spectroscopy.\
  \ Differences between NM and HY data were analyzed for practical significance using\
  \ magnitude-based inferences. HY reduced SpO2 (-10.7\xB11.9%, with chances to observe\
  \ a higher/similar/lower value in HY of 0/0/100%) and mechanical work (-8.2\xB1\
  2.1%; 0/0/100%). Muscle deoxygenation increased during sprints in both environments,\
  \ but was almost certainly higher in HY (12.5\xB13.1%, 100/0/0%). Between-sprint\
  \ muscle reoxygenation was likely more attenuated in HY (-11.1\xB111.9%; 2/7/91%).\
  \ The impairment in mechanical work in HY was very largely correlated with HY-induced\
  \ attenuation in muscle reoxygenation (r=0.78, 90% confidence limits: 0.49; 0.91).\
  \ Repeated-sprint performance is related, in part, to muscle reoxygenation capacity\
  \ during recovery periods. These results extend previous findings that muscle O2\
  \ availability is important for prolonged repeated-sprint performance, in particular\
  \ when the exercise is taken in hypoxia. \xA9 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S."
