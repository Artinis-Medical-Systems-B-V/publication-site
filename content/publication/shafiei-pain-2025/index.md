abstract: Objective measurements of pain and safe methods to alleviate it could revolutionize
  medicine. This study used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and virtual
  reality (VR) to improve pain assessment and explore non-pharmacological pain relief
  in cancer patients. Using resting-state fNIRS (rs-fNIRS) data and multinomial logistic
  regression (MLR), we identified brain-based pain biomarkers and classified pain
  severity in cancer patients. Participants included healthy individuals who underwent
  rs-fNIRS recording without VR (Group A), cancer patients who underwent rs-fNIRS
  recording both before and after engaging in the Oceania relaxation program VR intervention
  (Group B), and cancer patients who underwent rs-fNIRS recording without VR (Group
  C). All participants wore a wireless fNIRS headcap for brain activity recording.
  Pain severity was self-reported by patients using the FACES Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R).
  fNIRS data were analyzed with MLR, categorizing pain into no/mild (0–4/10), moderate
  (5–7/10), and severe (8–10/10) levels. The MLR model classified pain severity in
  an unseen test group, selected using the leave-one-participant-out technique and
  repeated across all participants, achieving an accuracy of 74%. VR significantly
  reduced pain intensity (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P textless 0.001), with significant
  changes in brain functional connectivity patterns (P textless 0.05). Additionally,
  75.61% of patients experienced pain reductions exceeding the clinically relevant
  threshold of 30%. These findings underscore the potential of fNIRS for pain assessment
  and VR as a useful non-pharmacological intervention for cancer-related pain management,
  with broader implications for clinical pain management.
