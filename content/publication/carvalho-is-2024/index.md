abstract: 'Objective To evaluate the acute effect of Kinesio Taping® (KT) on peripheral
  tissue perfusion in women with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). Methods: This
  randomized, double-blind controlled trial included 59 women with mild to moderate
  CVI. They were randomized to a control group (n = 23; 54.08 ± 9.04 years) and KT
  group (n = 36; 55.87 ± 9.97 years). Near-infrared spectroscopy was positioned in
  the medial gastrocnemius muscle for assessment of resting tissue perfusion 48 h
  after the first day of evaluation and after placement of the Kinesio Taping® tape.
  The evaluation also consisted of performing movements of the plethysmography examination.
  To verify the comparisons of pre- and post-Kinesio Taping® data, the variation delta
  was used for analysis. Mann–Whitney U test was performed an an alpha of 5% was considered
  statistically significant. Results: There wasn´t a significant difference between
  groups regarding the peripheral tissue perfusion evaluation variables Peripheral
  Oxygen Saturation Difference – DELTA_SPO2: (KT Group 3.21 (0.84–3.62); Control 2.21
  (1.59–4.83), p = 0.219) and Difference in deoxygenate hemoglobin values – DELTA_HHB
  (units) KT Group -0.62 (-2.14–0.67); Control Group -0.07 (-2.15–2.62) p = 0.238).
  Despite the lack of statistical significance, the KT group had a 785.7% greater
  drop in HHB values than the control group. Conclusions: Acute use of Kinesio Taping®
  in women with CVI did not significantly alter tissue perfusion of calf muscles.
  However, it was possible to observe percentage differences in venous retention to
  be considered from a clinical point of view'
