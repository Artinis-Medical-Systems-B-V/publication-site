abstract: 'We compared neuromuscular fatigue induced by cycling at a fixed perceived
  effort in normoxic condition (NOR) and three purported hypoxia modalities: systemic
  hypoxia (SyH, FiO2 = 0.13), blood flow restriction (BFR, 50% arterial occlusion
  pressure) and airflow restriction mask (ARM, calibrated to ~3500 m). Seventeen healthy
  young participants cycled for 20 min at a self-selected power output corresponding
  to a hard effort (15/20, Borg scale) on an innovative cycle ergometer allowing immediate
  neuromuscular evaluation. Isometric maximum voluntary contraction of the knee extensors
  (IMVC), central (voluntary activation, VA) and peripheral fatigue were measured
  before and every 5 min during cycling. Power output, peripheral oxygen saturation
  (SpO2), quadriceps oxygenation (near-infrared spectroscopy, TSI) and pain were assessed
  throughout cycling. Power output was lower in BFR and SyH compared to NOR and ARM
  and was lower in BFR compared to SyH. SpO2 was reduced only in SyH (mean 77% ± 4%).
  In all conditions, IMVC decreased from minute 5 and subsequently plateaued (~−10%
  to −20%), except in BFR, wherein it further declined to −40% ± 14% at minute 20
  in the presence of lowered VA and exacerbated muscle pain compared to other conditions.
  Muscle TSI was further decreased in SyH compared to other conditions. Our results
  confirm the inability of ARM to induce hypoxia. Compared to other conditions, BFR
  showed a greater reduction in IMVC and VA, in the presence of a higher quadriceps
  pain and no greater muscle deoxygenation. These results underline the psychophysiological
  impact of quadriceps pain on both maximal and submaximal motor output.'
