abstract: "Purpose: The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of\
  \ graduated compression socks (GCS) on enhancing muscle blood flow and oxygenation\
  \ during exercise and recovery in healthy subjects. Methods: Twelve healthy volunteers\
  \ completed a protocol involving baseline, exercise, and recovery periods with and\
  \ without GCS. Each test was repeated twice to assess repeatability of the results.\
  \ The applied sock pressure was measured prior to experimentation using a custom\
  \ pressure sensing system, and modified as necessary using tensor bandages to control\
  \ the applied load. During each of the experimental phases, blood velocity in the\
  \ popliteal artery, calf muscle tissue oxygenation, muscle activity, heart rate,\
  \ blood pressure, cardiac output, and applied pressure from the sock were measured.\
  \ Popliteal artery diameter was measured during baseline and recovery periods. Results:\
  \ The GCS significantly reduced deoxyhemoglobin (HHb) in the leg during baseline\
  \ (HHb, p\_=\_0.001) and total blood volume and HHb in the leg during exercise (total\
  \ hemoglobin, p\_=\_0.01; HHb, p\_=\_0.02). However, there were no differences in\
  \ leg muscle blood flow velocity or any other variables with and without GCS at\
  \ baseline, exercise, or recovery. Interestingly, it was found that the local applied\
  \ sock pressure was very sensitive to the sock application process and, furthermore,\
  \ the pressure varied considerably during exercise. Conclusions: No significant\
  \ changes were observed in measures reflecting oxygen delivery for healthy subjects\
  \ using GCS during exercise and recovery. Applied sock pressure was carefully controlled,\
  \ thus eliminating the sock application process as a variable."
