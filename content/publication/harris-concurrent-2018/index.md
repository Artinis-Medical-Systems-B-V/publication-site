abstract: 'Background: People with Parkinson''s disease (PD) commonly experience postural
  instability, resulting in poor balance and an increased risk of falls. Exercise-based
  video gaming (exergaming) is a form of physical training that is delivered through
  virtual reality technology to facilitate motor learning and is efficacious in improving
  balance in aged populations. In addition, studies have shown that anodal transcranial
  direct current stimulation (a-tDCS), when applied to the primary motor cortex, can
  augment motor learning when combined with physical training. However, no studies
  have investigated the combined effects of exergaming and tDCS on balance in people
  with PD. Methods/design: Twenty-four people with mild to moderate PD (Hoehn and
  Yahr scale score 2-4) will be randomly allocated to receive one of three interventions:
  (1) exergaming + a-tDCS, (2) exergaming + sham a-tDCS or (3) usual care. Participants
  in each exergaming group will perform two training sessions per week for 12 weeks.
  Each exergaming session will consist of a series of static and dynamic balance exercises
  using a rehabilitation-specific software programme (Jintronix) and 20 minutes of
  either sham or real a-tDCS (2 mA) delivered concurrently. Participants allocated
  to usual care will be asked to maintain their normal daily physical activities.
  All outcome measures will be assessed at baseline and at 6 weeks (mid-intervention),
  12 weeks (post-intervention) and 24 weeks (3-month follow-up) after baseline. The
  primary outcome measure will be the Limits of Stability Test. Secondary outcomes
  will include measures of static balance, leg strength, functional capacity, cognitive
  task-related cortical activation, corticospinal excitability and inhibition, and
  cognitive inhibition. Discussion: This will be the first trial to target balance
  in people with PD with combined exergaming and a-tDCS. We hypothesise that improvements
  in balance, functional and neurophysiological outcome measures, and neurocognitive
  outcome measures will be greater and longer-lasting following concurrent exergaming
  and a-tDCS than in those receiving sham tDCS or usual care.'
