abstract: 'Aging is usually accompanied by decrease in limb motor function and change
  in muscle metabolism patterns. However, few studies have investigated the aging
  effect on muscle hemodynamics of the upper extremity. This study aims to explore
  the aging effect on muscle metabolism patterns during upper limb''s exercise. Twelve
  middle-aged and elderly subjects and 12 young subjects were recruited, and muscle
  oxygenation signals from these subjectsâ€™ biceps brachii muscles were collected during
  active and passive upper limb''s encircling exercise with near-infrared spectroscopy
  (NIRS). The old group showed stronger muscle hemodynamic metabolism than the young
  group. The multiscale fuzzy approximate entropy and multiscale transfer entropy
  analyses indicated higher complexity and stronger interlimb coupling of the muscle
  oxygenation signals for the old group. Based on the selected muscle metabolism features,
  the constructed support vector machine model showed a high accuracy rate for classifying
  the two groups of subjects: 91.6% for the passive mode and 87.5% for the active
  mode. Our results proved the specific muscle metabolism patterns in the upper limb''s
  exercise for old subjects, promoting the understanding of the aging effect on muscle
  hemodynamics.'
