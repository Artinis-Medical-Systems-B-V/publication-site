 abstract = {Aging is usually accompanied by decrease in limb motor function and change in muscle metabolism patterns. However, few studies have investigated the aging effect on muscle hemodynamics of the upper extremity. This study aims to explore the aging effect on muscle metabolism patterns during upper limb's exercise. Twelve middle-aged and elderly subjects and 12 young subjects were recruited, and muscle oxygenation signals from these subjectsâ€™ biceps brachii muscles were collected during active and passive upper limb's encircling exercise with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The old group showed stronger muscle hemodynamic metabolism than the young group. The multiscale fuzzy approximate entropy and multiscale transfer entropy analyses indicated higher complexity and stronger interlimb coupling of the muscle oxygenation signals for the old group. Based on the selected muscle metabolism features, the constructed support vector machine model showed a high accuracy rate for classifying the two groups of subjects: 91.6% for the passive mode and 87.5% for the active mode. Our results proved the specific muscle metabolism patterns in the upper limb's exercise for old subjects, promoting the understanding of the aging effect on muscle hemodynamics.},
