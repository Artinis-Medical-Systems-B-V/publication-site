abstract: "It is well established that older adults are less able to perform attentionally\
  \ demanding motor tasks, placing them at greater risk of accident-related injury.\
  \ The primary purpose of this study was to investigate whether the interplay between\
  \ prefrontal and motor cortex activity could predict such age-related performance\
  \ deficits. Using a dual-task (DT) paradigm, 15 younger and 15 older adults participated\
  \ in experiment 1, where brain activity was simultaneously measured using functional\
  \ near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).\
  \ Experiment 1 demonstrated poorer performance for the older group across a range\
  \ of DTs combining visuomotor arm tracking with a secondary cognitive or motor task.\
  \ Interestingly however, older adults' DT performance error was isolated to the\
  \ motor component of DTs. TMS data revealed reduced motor cortex (M1) inhibition\
  \ during DTs for older adults, and a trend for this correlating with poorer performance.\
  \ In contrast, poorer performing younger adults showed significantly higher M1 inhibition.\
  \ Experiment 2 was conducted given a high amount of movement artifact in experiment\
  \ 1 fNIRS data. Using fNIRS to measure prefrontal, premotor, and motor cortex activity\
  \ in an additional 15 older adults, we found no evidence of an interplay between\
  \ these regions predicting DT performance. Nevertheless, performance data replicated\
  \ experiment 1 in showing that DT error was isolated to motor tasks in older adults,\
  \ with no significant cognitive task error. Overall, this study shows that older\
  \ adults seemed to adopt a \u2018cognitive-first' prioritisation strategy during\
  \ the DTs involved in our study, and that deficits in DT performance may be related\
  \ to the modulation of M1 inhibitory mechanisms. We propose that clinicians advise\
  \ older adults to allocate greater attention to motor tasks during activities where\
  \ they may be at risk of accident-related injury."
