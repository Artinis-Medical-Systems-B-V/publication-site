abstract: "Activation changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions have been linked\
  \ to acute exercise-induced improvements in cognitive performance. The type of exercise\
  \ performed may influence PFC activation, and further impact cognitive function.\
  \ The present study aimed to compare PFC activation during cognitive testing after\
  \ moderate-intensity, high intensity, and yoga exercises, and to determine if PFC\
  \ activation is linked to cognitive performance. Eight subjects (four male and four\
  \ female), aged 35 \xB1 5 completed a control, high intensity, moderate intensity,\
  \ and yoga exercises followed by administration of a cognitive task (NIH Toolbox\
  \ Fluid Cognition). Left and right PFC activation (LPFC and RPFC, respectively)\
  \ were evaluated by measuring hemoglobin difference (Hbdiff) changes during post-exercise\
  \ cognitive assessment using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Activation\
  \ during the cognitive test was higher in the LPFC after moderate intensity exercise\
  \ compared to control, high intensity, and yoga (5.30 \xB1 6.65 vs. 2.26 \xB1 2.40,\
  \ 2.50 \xB1 1.48, 2.41 \xB1 2.36 \xB5M, p < 0.05, respectively). A negative relationship\
  \ was detected between LPFC and processing speed after exercise. PFC activation\
  \ did not align with cognitive performance. However, acute exercise, regardless\
  \ of type, appeared to alter neural processing. Specifically, less PFC activation\
  \ was required for a given neural output after exercise."
