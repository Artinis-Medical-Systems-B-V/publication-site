abstract: The gold standard to assess the aerobic capacity in physically active subjects
  and athletes is the maximal oxygen consumption test (VO2-max), which involves analysis
  of exhaled-gases and cardiorespiratory variables obtained via the breath-by-breath
  method in an ergospirometer during an incremental exercise. However, this method
  cannot elucidate metabolic changes at the muscular level. Near-infrared spectroscopy
  (NIRS) has emerged as a valuable technology to evaluate local oxygen levels (Tissular
  Saturation Index, TSI) by quantifying the concentrations of oxygenated (O2-Hb) and
  deoxygenated (H-Hb) hemoglobin in the microvasculature of tissues. NIRS applications
  extend to respiratory and locomotor muscles, assessing metabolic changes associated
  with the cost of breathing (COB) and peripheral workload, respectively. Additionally,
  cerebral regions, such as the prefrontal cortex, have been explored with NIRS technology
  to assess physiological changes related to cognitive demand associated with planning
  or ideation of motor tasks linked to sports performance. Thus, by analyzing exercise-induced
  changes (D) in O2-Hb, H-Hb, and TSI, it is possible to identify central and peripheral
  exercise limitations, particularly when endurance training is the main component
  of physical fitness (e.g., running, cycling, triathlon, etc.). Addressing these
  factors is paramount for coaches and exercise physiologists to optimize athletic
  performance, incorporating training strategies focused on the primary exercise-limiting
  factors. This study outlines a protocol for utilizing wearables devices equipped
  with NIRS technology to analyze exercise changes in TSI, O2-Hb, and H-Hb, alongside
  cardiorespiratory variables typically registered in athletes during VO2-max tests.
  This approach offers a comprehensive method for identifying the primary systems
  involved in stopping exercise progression and sports performance improvement.
