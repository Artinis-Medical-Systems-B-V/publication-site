 abstract = {The gold standard to assess the aerobic capacity in physically active subjects and athletes is the maximal oxygen consumption test (VO2-max), which involves analysis of exhaled-gases and cardiorespiratory variables obtained via the breath-by-breath method in an ergospirometer during an incremental exercise. However, this method cannot elucidate metabolic changes at the muscular level. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has emerged as a valuable technology to evaluate local oxygen levels (Tissular Saturation Index, TSI) by quantifying the concentrations of oxygenated (O2-Hb) and deoxygenated (H-Hb) hemoglobin in the microvasculature of tissues. NIRS applications extend to respiratory and locomotor muscles, assessing metabolic changes associated with the cost of breathing (COB) and peripheral workload, respectively. Additionally, cerebral regions, such as the prefrontal cortex, have been explored with NIRS technology to assess physiological changes related to cognitive demand associated with planning or ideation of motor tasks linked to sports performance. Thus, by analyzing exercise-induced changes (D) in O2-Hb, H-Hb, and TSI, it is possible to identify central and peripheral exercise limitations, particularly when endurance training is the main component of physical fitness (e.g., running, cycling, triathlon, etc.). Addressing these factors is paramount for coaches and exercise physiologists to optimize athletic performance, incorporating training strategies focused on the primary exercise-limiting factors. This study outlines a protocol for utilizing wearables devices equipped with NIRS technology to analyze exercise changes in TSI, O2-Hb, and H-Hb, alongside cardiorespiratory variables typically registered in athletes during VO2-max tests. This approach offers a comprehensive method for identifying the primary systems involved in stopping exercise progression and sports performance improvement.},
