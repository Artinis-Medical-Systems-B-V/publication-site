abstract: Research investigating the neural processes related to music perception
  and production constitutes a well-established field within the cognitive neurosciences.
  While most neuroimaging tools have limitations in studying the complexity of musical
  experiences, functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) represents a promising,
  relatively new tool for studying music processes in both laboratory and ecological
  settings, which is also suitable for both typical and pathological populations across
  development. Here we systematically review fNIRS studies on music cognition, highlighting
  prospects and potentialities. We also include an overview of fNIRS basic theory,
  together with a brief comparison to characteristics of other neuroimaging tools.
  Fifty-nine studies meeting inclusion criteria (i.e., using fNIRS with music as the
  primary stimulus) are presented across five thematic sections. Critical discussion
  of methodology leads us to propose guidelines of good practices aiming for robust
  signal analyses and reproducibility. A continuously updated world map is proposed,
  including basic information from studies meeting the inclusion criteria. It provides
  an organized, accessible, and updatable reference database, which could serve as
  a catalyst for future collaborations within the community. In conclusion, fNIRS
  shows potential for investigating cognitive processes in music, particularly in
  ecological contexts and with special populations, aligning with current research
  priorities in music cognition.
