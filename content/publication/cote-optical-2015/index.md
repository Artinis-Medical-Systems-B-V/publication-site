abstract: "\xA9 2015 SPIE.Background: Acute scrotum is a urologic condition defined\
  \ by scrotal pain, swelling, and redness of acute onset. Prompt diagnosis and treatment\
  \ are necessary to preserve testicular viability. The history and clinical symptoms\
  \ reported are key to diagnosis and proper treatment, but are not always readily\
  \ obtained in children, in whom common causes of acute scrotum include testicular\
  \ torsion, torsion of the appendix testis, and epididymitis. These acute conditions\
  \ have different causal pathology that mandate specific treatment, hence the importance\
  \ of early and accurate diagnosis. Methods: A novel optical method was developed\
  \ for rapid evaluation of acute scrotum by measuring and comparing an absolute measure\
  \ of tissue oxygen saturation index (TSI %) obtained non-invasively from the affected\
  \ testis and a control site (skin surface of quadriceps muscle), using a wireless\
  \ continuous wave near infrared spectroscopy device with spatially resolved configuration\
  \ (SR-NIRS). Results: Five male children with symptoms of acute scrotum were studied\
  \ using SR-NIRS in addition to standard practices for diagnosis (history, physical\
  \ examination, lab tests, color Doppler ultrasonography of the testis and surgical\
  \ exploration when necessary). SR-NIRS successfully differentiated between three\
  \ conditions by showing a higher TSI% in 2 cases of epididymitis, lower TSI% in\
  \ 2 cases of testicular torsion and normal TSI% in 1 case of torsion of the appendix\
  \ testis. Conclusion: This pilot study indicates that SR-NIRS monitoring of (TSI%)\
  \ in the testes is feasible as a non-invasive, bedside and quick optical method\
  \ to identify differences in an absolute measure of tissue oxygenation, and that\
  \ such measurement offers a new adjunct for differential diagnosis of the causal\
  \ pathology of acute scrotum in children."
