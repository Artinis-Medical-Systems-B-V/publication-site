 abstract = {Neurocinematics is an emerging interdisciplinary field at 
the intersection between Human-Computer Interaction, 
Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), and cinematics, that 
explores the use of brain and physiological data (such as 
functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)), to evaluate 
a variety of media content. While many studies focused on 
comparing features of physiological activity between 
genres, this study aims to examine the cinematic content in 
the same genre but in different modes. Specifically, we are 
interested in the brain responses to audio and visual content, 
which have a similar emotional impact, in horror movies. 
Using non-invasive brain monitoring devices (fNIRS) 
targeting participants' prefrontal cortex, we collected and 
analysed their brain activity responses in comparison to 
subjective experience while watching a series of horror 
video clips. The results show changes in cognitive and 
emotional responses during the A, audio only modes, V, 
visual only modes, and M, audio and visual together modes 
for the horror stimulus, across fNIRS and subjective data. 
Our results are in line previous findings and bring novel 
insights into how brain activity can help researchers 
evaluate audio-visual content and promise an exciting 
future for adaptive horror experiences.},
