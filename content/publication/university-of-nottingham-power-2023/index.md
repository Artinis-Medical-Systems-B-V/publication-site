abstract: Neurocinematics is an emerging interdisciplinary field at  the intersection
  between Human-Computer Interaction,  Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), and cinematics,
  that  explores the use of brain and physiological data (such as  functional Near
  Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)), to evaluate  a variety of media content. While many
  studies focused on  comparing features of physiological activity between  genres,
  this study aims to examine the cinematic content in  the same genre but in different
  modes. Specifically, we are  interested in the brain responses to audio and visual
  content,  which have a similar emotional impact, in horror movies.  Using non-invasive
  brain monitoring devices (fNIRS)  targeting participants' prefrontal cortex, we
  collected and  analysed their brain activity responses in comparison to  subjective
  experience while watching a series of horror  video clips. The results show changes
  in cognitive and  emotional responses during the A, audio only modes, V,  visual
  only modes, and M, audio and visual together modes  for the horror stimulus, across
  fNIRS and subjective data.  Our results are in line previous findings and bring
  novel  insights into how brain activity can help researchers  evaluate audio-visual
  content and promise an exciting  future for adaptive horror experiences.
