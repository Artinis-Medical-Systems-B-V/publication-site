abstract: Classroom teaching is essential for cognitive development and cultural evolution,
  yet its neurocognitive mechanisms remain unclear. Here, this is explored in a university
  graduate course by combining wearable functional near‐infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
  and machine learning models. The results show that blended teaching involving both
  students’ recalling and teachers’ lecturing leads to better learning outcomes than
  lecturing alone. Moreover, during the same lecturing phase, blended teaching induces
  knowledge construction in the middle frontal cortex (MFC), while lecturing alone
  induces knowledge representation in the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ), with
  the former significantly correlating with the final learning outcomes. Additionally,
  the MFC's construction begins during earlier recalling but is significantly facilitated
  by later lecturing. Finally, when teacher's TPJ activity precedes that of students’
  MFC, significant teacher–student neural synchronization is observed during lecturing
  of blended teaching and is correlated with learning outcomes. These findings suggest
  that, in the real classroom teaching, the MFC serves as a hub of a rapid cortical
  learning process, supporting knowledge construction through a projection from the
  teacher's TPJ.
