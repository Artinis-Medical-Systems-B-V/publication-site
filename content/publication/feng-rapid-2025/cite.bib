 abstract = {Classroom teaching is essential for cognitive development and cultural evolution, yet its neurocognitive mechanisms remain unclear. Here, this is explored in a university graduate course by combining wearable functional near‐infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and machine learning models. The results show that blended teaching involving both students’ recalling and teachers’ lecturing leads to better learning outcomes than lecturing alone. Moreover, during the same lecturing phase, blended teaching induces knowledge construction in the middle frontal cortex (MFC), while lecturing alone induces knowledge representation in the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ), with the former significantly correlating with the final learning outcomes. Additionally, the MFC's construction begins during earlier recalling but is significantly facilitated by later lecturing. Finally, when teacher's TPJ activity precedes that of students’ MFC, significant teacher–student neural synchronization is observed during lecturing of blended teaching and is correlated with learning outcomes. These findings suggest that, in the real classroom teaching, the MFC serves as a hub of a rapid cortical learning process, supporting knowledge construction through a projection from the teacher's TPJ.},
