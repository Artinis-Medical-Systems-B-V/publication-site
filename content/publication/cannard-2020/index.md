abstract: Brain-computer interfaces and wearable neurotechnologies are now used to
  measure real-time neural and physiologic signals from the human body and hold immense
  potential for advancements in medical diagnostics, prevention, and intervention.
  Given the future role that wearable neurotechnologies will likely serve in the health
  sector, a critical state-of-the-art assessment is necessary to gain a better understanding
  of their current strengths and limitations. In this chapter we present wearable
  electroencephalography systems that reflect groundbreaking innovations and improvements
  in real-time data collection and health monitoring. We focus on specifications reflecting
  technical advantages and disadvantages, discuss their use in fundamental and clinical
  research, their current applications, limitations, and future directions. While
  many methodological and ethical challenges remain, these systems host the potential
  to facilitate large-scale data collection far beyond the reach of traditional research
  laboratory settings.
