abstract: "The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of inducing muscle oxygenation\
  \ using an intermittent cycling exercise on recovery kinetics after exercise-induced\
  \ muscle damage. Ten soccer players performed single-leg knee flexors exercise:\
  \ 75 eccentric contractions. The day after, subjects performed an intermittent cycling\
  \ exercise of 12 min (15 s work - 15 s rest)or recovered passively in a balanced\
  \ and randomized cross-over design. Force, single and double-leg countermovement\
  \ jumps, muscle soreness, perceived recovery and creatine kinase concentrations\
  \ were assessed through a 72 h period. Oxygenation during cycling was assessed using\
  \ Near Infrared Spectroscopy. Results showed an increase in knee flexors oxygenation\
  \ using intermittent cycling ($\u0394$HbO 2 = 70.2 \xB1 19.8%; $\u0394$HHb = 68.2\
  \ \xB1 14.1%). Possibly small detrimental effect of cycling on eccentric force was\
  \ found (ES = -0.58, 90% CI: -1.33 to 0.17). Small detrimental effects of cycling\
  \ were found for soreness and perceived recovery. Implementing intermittent cycling\
  \ exercise the day after muscle damage may be detrimental for recovery."
