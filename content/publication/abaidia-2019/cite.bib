 abstract = {The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of inducing muscle oxygenation using an intermittent cycling exercise on recovery kinetics after exercise-induced muscle damage. Ten soccer players performed single-leg knee flexors exercise: 75 eccentric contractions. The day after, subjects performed an intermittent cycling exercise of 12 min (15 s work - 15 s rest)or recovered passively in a balanced and randomized cross-over design. Force, single and double-leg countermovement jumps, muscle soreness, perceived recovery and creatine kinase concentrations were assessed through a 72 h period. Oxygenation during cycling was assessed using Near Infrared Spectroscopy. Results showed an increase in knee flexors oxygenation using intermittent cycling ($Δ$HbO 2 = 70.2 ± 19.8%; $Δ$HHb = 68.2 ± 14.1%). Possibly small detrimental effect of cycling on eccentric force was found (ES = -0.58, 90% CI: -1.33 to 0.17). Small detrimental effects of cycling were found for soreness and perceived recovery. Implementing intermittent cycling exercise the day after muscle damage may be detrimental for recovery.},
