abstract: Research investigating aging and neurological disorders that affect gait
  and balance aims to increase the understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms
  involved in task performance. Traditional brain-imaging techniques are restricted
  in their use in studies assessing brain activity during real-time balance and walking
  tasks, often restrained to the use of mental imagery, virtual reality, or single-segment
  motor tasks (e.g., finger tapping, button pressing, or foot movement), which lack
  ecological validity. Recent developments in mobile brain imaging technologies like
  functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) allow
  the assessment of cortical brain activity during actual walking and standing tasks.
  The use of these techniques, in conjunction with human movement tracking devices,
  is known as Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI). MoBI provides a noninvasive, cost-effective,
  and ecologically valid approach to the simultaneous study of brain and body function.
  This book chapter provides an overview of the technology involved in MoBI, in addition
  to the challenges relating to data collection, integration, and standardization.
  We also discuss the current knowledge of the neural mechanisms involved in balance
  and walking with aging and neurological disorders. MoBI research provides valuable
  insights into the neural networks involved in gait and balance impairments, potentially
  allowing for the development of more effective and personalized treatments or targeted
  interventions.
