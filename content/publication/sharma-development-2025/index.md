abstract: 'Existing research on neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) identifies
  two primary control approaches: therapist-operated systems and participant-controlled
  systems. Therapist-operated NMES devices typically employ switches and potentiometers
  for control, whereas participant-controlled systems offer diverse input methods,
  including switches, buttons, joysticks, electromyography electrodes, voice-activated
  commands, and sip-and-puff devices. A critical limitation of current NMES technology
  lies in its failure to mimic the body''s natural muscle recruitment process during
  electrical stimulation, resulting in premature fatigue and diminished user engagement.
  A particularly significant drawback is the absence of joint range-of-motion dependency
  observed during voluntary movements and active involvement of participant. This
  limitation prevents precise control over spatial and temporal parameters, such as
  modulating motor unit recruitment relative to joint position, during neuromuscular
  rehabilitation. Furthermore, existing devices cannot accurately reproduce the co-contraction
  dynamics and reciprocal activation patterns seen in synergistic, agonist, and antagonist
  muscle groups during natural movement. Addressing these challenges requires developing
  innovative NMES technology capable of activating the neuromuscular system while
  replicating natural voluntary recruitment patterns. Such advancements would not
  only improve muscle strengthening outcomes but also enhance participant adherence
  through more effective cortical and peripheral neuromuscular engagement.'
