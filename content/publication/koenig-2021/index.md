abstract: 'Significance: Oxygenation is one of the skin tissue physiological properties
  to follow for patient care management. Furthermore, long-term monitoring of such
  parameters is needed at the patient bed as well as outside the hospital. Diffuse
  reflectance spectroscopy has been widely used for this purpose. Aim: The aim of
  the study is to propose a low-cost system for the long-term measurement of skin
  physiological parameters in contact. Approach: We have developed a low-cost, wearable,
  CMOS-based device. We propose an origi- nal method for processing diffuse reflectance
  data to calculate the tissue oxygen saturation (StO2). Results: We tested the device
  for the assessment of tissue oxygenation during a first-in-human clinical trial
  that took place at the Grenoble University Hospital France. Conclusions: The results
  of this clinical trial show a good accordance between our sensor and commercial
  devices used a reference.'
