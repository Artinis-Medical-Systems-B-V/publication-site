abstract: "Parkinson's disease (PD) is often classified into tremor dominant (TD)\
  \ and postural instability gait disorder (PIGD) subtypes. Degeneration of subcortical/cortical\
  \ pathways is different between PD subtypes, which leads to differences in motor\
  \ behavior. However, the influence of PD subtype on cortical activity during walking\
  \ remains poorly understood. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the influence of\
  \ PD motor subtypes on cortical activity during unobstructed walking and obstacle\
  \ avoidance. Seventeen PIGD and 19 TD patients performed unobstructed walking and\
  \ obstacle avoidance conditions. Brain activity was measured using a mobile functional\
  \ near-infrared spectroscopy\u2013electroencephalography (EEG) systems, and gait\
  \ parameters were analyzed using an electronic carpet. Concentrations of oxygenated\
  \ hemoglobin (HbO2) of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and EEG absolute power from alpha,\
  \ beta, and gamma bands in FCz, Cz, CPz, and Oz channels were calculated. These\
  \ EEG channels correspond to supplementary motor area, primary motor cortex, posterior\
  \ parietal cortex, and visual cortex, respectively. Postural instability gait disorder\
  \ patients presented higher PFC activity than TD patients, regardless of the walking\
  \ condition. Tremor dominant patients presented reduced beta power in the Cz channel\
  \ during obstacle avoidance compared to unobstructed walking. Both TD and PIGD patients\
  \ decreased alpha and beta power in the FCz and CPz channels. In conclusion, PIGD\
  \ patients need to recruit additional cognitive resources from the PFC for walking.\
  \ Both TD and PIGD patients presented changes in the activation of brain areas related\
  \ to motor/sensorimotor areas in order to maintain balance control during obstacle\
  \ avoidance, being that TD patients presented further changes in the motor area\
  \ (Cz channel) to avoid obstacles."
