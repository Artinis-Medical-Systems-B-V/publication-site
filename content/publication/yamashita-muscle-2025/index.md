abstract: Understanding how training status influences muscle oxygen dynamics during
  resistance exercise is crucial for optimizing exercise prescriptions and performance
  adaptations. However, limited information is available regarding muscle oxygenation
  responses during fatigue resistance exercises across different training levels.
  Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effects of long-concentric (CON-L) and
  long-eccentric (ECC-L) resistance exercise on muscle oxygen dynamics in recreationally
  trained (RTR) and well-trained (WTR) individuals. Eleven male RTR and nine male
  WTR participants performed unilateral leg extension exercises, with each leg randomly
  assigned to CON-L (5 s concentric, 1 s isometric, and 1 s eccentric) or ECC-L (1
  s concentric, 1 s isometric, and 5 s eccentric). Each protocol was performed to
  volitional failure for three sets with a 2-min rest between sets. Muscle oxygen
  saturation (StO2) of the vastus lateralis was continuously monitored via near-infrared
  spectroscopy. Time-normalized StO2 values were analyzed at 20% intervals, and the
  minimum StO2 during each set was recorded. Results indicated that WTR individuals
  exhibited significantly lower StO2 during exercise compared to RTR, suggesting greater
  muscle oxygen utilization. No significant differences were observed between CON-L
  and ECC-L in either group. These findings suggest that training status plays a key
  role in muscle oxygen dynamics during resistance exercise
