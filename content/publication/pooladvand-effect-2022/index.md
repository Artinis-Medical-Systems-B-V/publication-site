abstract: Recent research suggests construction workers fall prey to the cognitive
  biases of risk compensation, wherein workers offset safety improvements by taking
  more risks. Parallel previous literature indicates that time pressure and mental
  load may increase workers’ arousal and stress. However, it is unclear whether time,
  productivity, and/or cognitive demands can worsen risk compensation behaviors by
  stimulating workers to make riskier decisions to complete tasks faster. Combining
  a multi-modal mixed-reality environment with wearable neuro-psychophysiological
  sensors, this study examines changes in safety and task performance for high-risk
  electrical-line tasks simulated under time/performance pressure and cognitive demand.
  The results show risk-compensation is in play as subjects over-rely on safety technologies
  and maintain their risk perception even while undertaking more risks to adapt to
  increased time pressure and/or cognitive demand. This paper contributes to body
  of knowledge by affecting safety-training approaches and the controls needed when
  providing workers with safety protection and new technological advances.
