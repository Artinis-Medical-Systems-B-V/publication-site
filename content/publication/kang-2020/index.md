abstract: 'PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare the acute effects of different types
  (treadmill vs. cycle) of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on cerebral blood flow
  and cognitive function in young adults. METHODS: By a randomized crossover study
  design, ten participants were initially assigned to either treadmill exercise (TE;
  n=5) or cycle ergometer exercise (CE; n=5) and then they performed the other with
  seven-day wash-out period. Both exercises were implemented at the target heart rate
  corresponding to 70% of heart rate reserve for 30 minutes. Cognitive function was
  assessed by the Stroop Color-Word test at pre-and post-exercise. Cerebral blood
  flow was continuously monitored using near-infrared spectroscopy technique during
  rest, cognitive function test (CFT), and exercise. RESULTS: There was a significant
  group by time interaction in tissue saturation index (TSI) (p=.046). Post-hoc analysis
  presented that TSI at post-exercise CFT was higher than during exercise in TE (p=.02).
  In both exercises, TSI at pre-exercise CFT significantly increased compared to the
  resting value (p=.001). Cerebral oxyhemoglobin level was significantly increased
  during exercise and at post-exercise CFT compared to the resting value in both exercises
  (p<.001). The reaction time for certain cognitive tasks such as color, word with
  matched color, word with color interference, and color with word interference was
  improved after both exercises (p<.05). CONCLUSIONS: One-bout of moderate-intensity
  aerobic exercise acutely improves cerebral blood flow and cognitive function even
  in healthy young adults. Exercise types with the same intensity do not seem to make
  meaningful difference in the positive effects of aerobic exercise.'
