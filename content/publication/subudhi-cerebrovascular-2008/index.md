abstract: "We sought to describe cerebrovascular responses to incremental exercise\
  \ and test the hypothesis that changes in cerebral oxygenation influence maximal\
  \ performance. Eleven men cycled in three conditions: 1) sea level (SL); 2) acute\
  \ hypoxia [AH; hypobaric chamber, inspired PO2 (PIO2) 86 Torr]; and 3) chronic hypoxia\
  \ [CH; 4,300 m, PIO2 86 Torr]. At maximal work rate (\u1E86max), fraction of inspired\
  \ oxygen (FIO2) was surreptitiously increased to 0.60, while subjects were encouraged\
  \ to continue pedaling. Changes in cerebral (frontal lobe) (COX) and muscle (vastus\
  \ lateralis) oxygenation (MOX) (near infrared spectroscopy), middle cerebral artery\
  \ blood flow velocity (MCA Vmean; transcranial Doppler), and end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2)\
  \ were analyzed across %\u1E86max (significance at P < 0.05). At SL, PETCO2, MCA\
  \ Vmean, and COX fell as work rate rose from 75 to 100% \u1E86max. During AH, PETCO2\
  \ and MCA V mean declined from 50 to 100% \u1E86max, while C OX fell from rest.\
  \ With CH, PETCO2 and COX dropped throughout exercise, while MCA Vmean fell only\
  \ from 75 to 100% \u1E86max. MOX fell from rest to 75% W? max at SL and AH and throughout\
  \ exercise in CH. The magnitude of fall in COX, but not MOX, was different between\
  \ conditions (CH > AH > SL). FIO2 0.60 at \u1E86max did not prolong exercise at\
  \ SL, yet allowed subjects to continue for 96 \xB1 61 s in AH and 162 \xB1 90 s\
  \ in CH. During FIO2 0.60, COX rose and MOX remained constant as work rate increased.\
  \ Thus cerebral hypoxia appeared to impose a limit to maximal exercise during hypobaric\
  \ hypoxia (PIO2 86 Torr), since its reversal was associated with improved performance."
