 abstract = {Objective: To investigate the intervention effect of cranial pulse current stimulator (tPCS) on fatigue accumulation after moderate-intensity exercise by using blood analysis and functional near-infrared spectroscopy, and to analyze the type and magnitude of the fatigue effect of tPCS on fatigue in combination with behavioral performance.

Methods: Ninety healthy college students were randomly and equally divided into an experimental group (Group A) and a control group (Group B), and both groups underwent moderate-intensity training for 7 days. Before and after the experiment, all subjects received physiological, biochemical, behavioral, and subjective fatigue indexes, followed by exercise training, and each day of exercise training was followed by tPCS intervention (stimulus intensity of 1.5 mA, stimulus duration of 20 min) and subjective fatigue scale (RPE) test.

Results: ① After the tPCS intervention, the daily RPE scores of group A were smaller than those of group B; ② The values of the indexes oxygenated hemoglobin concentration (Oxy-Hb), deoxyhemoglobin concentration (HHb), testosterone (T), and testosterone-to-cortisol ratio (T/C) of group A did not differ significantly from those of the pre-intervention period, and the values of all the indexes of group B were significantly different from those of the pre-intervention period. ③ After tPCS intervention, the values of Oxy-Hb, T, T/C, and on-attention decreased in Groups A and B, with Oxy-Hb decreasing the most; the values of HHb, total hemoglobin concentration (HbTot), hemoglobin concentration difference (HbDiff), cortisol (C), creatine kinase (CK), and reaction time (RT) increased, with the greatest increase in HbDiff; and the Group A The magnitude of change of each index was smaller than that of Group B. After tPCS intervention, the contribution of central fatigue to the effect of reaction time science was greater than that of peripheral fatigue.

Conclusion: ① tPCS can delay the development of central fatigue and peripheral fatigue. ② The effect of tPCS on central fatigue is greater than on peripheral fatigue. ③ The effect of tPCS on reaction timing is mainly realized by changing the state of central fatigue.},
