abstract: To enable virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) that treats anxiety disorders
  by gradually exposing the patient to fear using virtual reality (VR), it is important
  to monitor the patient's fear levels during the exposure. Despite the evidence of
  a fear circuit in the brain as reflected by functional near-infrared spectroscopy
  (fNIRS), the measurement of fear response in highly immersive VR using fNIRS is
  limited, especially in combination with a head-mounted display (HMD). In particular,
  it is unclear to what extent fNIRS can differentiate users with and without anxiety
  disorders and detect fear response in a highly ecological setting using an HMD.
  In this study, we investigated fNIRS signals captured from participants with and
  without a fear of height response. To examine the extent to which fNIRS signals
  of both groups differ, we conducted an experiment during which participants with
  moderate fear of heights and participants without it were exposed to VR scenarios
  involving heights and no heights. The between-group statistical analysis shows that
  the fNIRS data of the control group and the experimental group are significantly
  different only in the channel located close to right frontotemporal lobe, where
  the grand average oxygenated hemoglobin Δ[HbO] contrast signal of the experimental
  group exceeds that of the control group. The within-group statistical analysis shows
  significant differences between the grand average Δ[HbO] contrast values during
  fear responses and those during no-fear responses, where the Δ[HbO] contrast values
  of the fear responses were significantly higher than those of the no-fear responses
  in the channels located towards the frontal part of the prefrontal cortex. Also,
  the channel located close to frontocentral lobe was found to show significant difference
  for the grand average deoxygenated hemoglobin contrast signals. Support vector machine-based
  classifier could detect fear responses at an accuracy up to 70% and 74% in subject-dependent
  and subject-independent classifications, respectively. The results demonstrate that
  cortical hemodynamic responses of a control group and an experimental group are
  different to a considerable extent, exhibiting the feasibility and ecological validity
  of the combination of VR-HMD and fNIRS to elicit and detect fear responses. This
  research thus paves a way toward the a brain-computer interface to effectively manipulate
  and control VRET.
