abstract: 'INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: The main goal of the current study was to assess
  changes in O2Hb signals for both brain and bladder during natural filling in efforts
  to establish a four-quadrant grid to enhance categorization of Overactive Bladder
  (OAB) subtypes. Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to assess
  pre-frontal cortex (PFC) neuroexcitation and standard bladder NIRS (bNIRS) was used
  to assess bladder hemodynamics.  METHODS: Both OAB (ICIq-OAB urgency question ≥2)
  and healthy control participants completed two natural filling cycles. fNIRS data
  for the PFC (Brite,Artinis) and bNIRS data for the bladder (Portalite, Artinis)
  were simultaneously recorded. Average O2Hb signals were recorded during a period
  of high sensation defined as the time from patient-reported ‘first desire to void’
  to bladder capacity. The early (1st half) and late (2nd half) of this period were
  analyzed and compared for both the PFC and bladder. To compare bladder and brain
  O2Hb, relative change in bladder O2Hb was plotted against relative change in bladder
  O2Hb. Data were compared with Fisher''s Exact tests or t-tests.  RESULTS: Twenty-seven
  participants were recruited and 22 completed the study with sufficient data (OAB:
  n=12, normal controls: n=10). The OAB group was significantly older and with higher
  BMI (ptextless0.05). Groups had comparable race and baseline fluid intake. Groups
  are compared in Figure 1. In the normal quadrant (top right: high bladder and brain
  O2Hb) there were 9/10 normal (90%) and 2/12 OAB (17%), ptextless0.05. The remainder
  of the OAB participants clustered in the Bladder-Based OAB quadrant (top left: low
  bladder O2Hb and high brain O2Hb) with 4/12 (33%), Brain-Based OAB quadrant (bottom
  left: high bladder O2Hb and low brain O2Hb) with 2/10 (33%), and Both quadrant (bottom
  right: low bladder and brain O2Hb) with 2/10 (17%).  CONCLUSIONS: Combined Brain
  and Bladder fNIRS during natural filling represents a non-invasive and more objective
  technique that can potentially be used to categorize OAB subgroups. The grid enables
  a visual method to determine if OAB pathophysiology is a brain problem, a bladder
  problem, or a combined organ problem. Further research is required to validate this
  combined fNIRS and bNIRS subtyping approach.'
