abstract: "This crossover study examined whether acute cardiovascular responses, baroreceptor\
  \ sensitivity (BRS), and brain oxygenation during isometric exercise are altered\
  \ after cigarette smoking. Twelve young, habitual smokers randomly performed a smoking\
  \ and a control protocol, during which participants smoked one cigarette (0.9 mg\
  \ nicotine) or a sham cigarette, before exercise. Testing involved baseline, a 5-minute\
  \ smoking, a 10-minute post-smoking rest, 3-minute handgrip exercise (30% maximum\
  \ voluntary contraction), and recovery. Beat-to-beat blood pressure, heart rate\
  \ (HR), and cerebral oxygenation (near infrared spectroscopy) were continuously\
  \ monitored. Double-product, stroke volume (SV), cardiac output, systemic vascular\
  \ resistance and BRS were assessed. During post-smoking rest, systolic or diastolic\
  \ blood pressure (140.8 \xB1 12.1/87.0 \xB1 6.9 vs. 125.9 \xB1 7.1/77.3 \xB1 5.5\
  \ mm Hg), HR, and double product were higher in the smoking versus the control protocol,\
  \ whereas BRS was lower (P <.05). During handgrip exercise, smoking resulted in\
  \ greater HR and double product (17,240 \xB1 3893 vs. 15,424 \xB1 3173 mm Hg\u02D9\
  bpm) and lower BRS versus the control protocol (P <.05), without significant differences\
  \ in stroke volume and systemic vascular resistance between protocols. During recovery,\
  \ smoking elicited a delayed return of brain oxygenation indices, lower BRS, and\
  \ higher double product. Smoking a cigarette shortly before the exercise session\
  \ amplifies myocardial stress and dysregulates autonomic function and cerebral oxygenation\
  \ during exercise and recovery, even in young habitual smokers, perceived as free\
  \ from long-term cardiovascular effects of smoking."
