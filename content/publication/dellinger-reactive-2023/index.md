abstract: 'We investigated the relationship between muscle microvascular responses
  during reactive hyperemia as assessed using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) with
  changes in skeletal muscle oxygen saturation during exercise. Thirty young untrained
  adults (M/W: 20/10; 23 ± 5 years) completed a maximal cycling exercise test to determine
  exercise intensities performed on a subsequent visit separated by seven days. At
  the second visit, post-occlusive reactive hyperemia was measured as changes in NIRS-derived
  tissue saturation index (TSI) at the left vastus lateralis muscle. Variables of
  interest included desaturation magnitude, resaturation rate, resaturation half-time,
  and hyperemic area under the curve. Afterwards, two 4-minute bouts of moderate intensity
  cycling followed by one bout of severe intensity cycling to fatigue took place while
  TSI was measured at the vastus lateralis muscle. TSI was averaged across the last
  60-s of each moderate intensity bout then averaged together for analysis, and at
  60-s into severe exercise. The change in TSI (∆TSI) during exercise is expressed
  relative to a 20 W cycling baseline. On average, the ΔTSI was −3.4 ± 2.4 % and −7.2
  ± 2.8 % during moderate and severe intensity cycling, respectively. Resaturation
  half-time was correlated with the ΔTSI during moderate (r = −0.42, P = 0.01) and
  severe (r = −0.53, P = 0.002) intensity exercise. No other reactive hyperemia variable
  was found to correlate with ΔTSI. These results indicate that resaturation half-time
  during reactive hyperemia represents a resting muscle microvascular measure that
  associates with the degree of skeletal muscle desaturation during exercise in young
  adults.'
