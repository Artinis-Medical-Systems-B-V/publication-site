abstract: "Given the critical risks to public health and safety that can involve lapses\
  \ in attention (e.g., through implication in workplace accidents), researchers have\
  \ sought to develop cognitive-state tracking technologies, capable of alerting individuals\
  \ engaged in cognitively demanding tasks of potentially dangerous decrements in\
  \ their levels of attention. The purpose of the present study was to address this\
  \ issue through an investigation of the reliability of optical measures of cortical\
  \ correlates of attention in conjunction with machine learning techniques to distinguish\
  \ between states of full attention and states characterized by reduced attention\
  \ capacity during a sustained attention task. Seven subjects engaged in a 30 minutes\
  \ duration sustained attention reaction time task with near infrared spectroscopy\
  \ (NIRS) monitoring over the prefrontal and the right parietal areas. NIRS signals\
  \ from the first 10 minutes of the task were considered as characterizing the 'full\
  \ attention' class, while the NIRS signals from the last 10 minutes of the task\
  \ were considered as characterizing the 'attention decrement' class. A two-class\
  \ support vector machine algorithm was exploited to distinguish between the two\
  \ levels of attention using appropriate NIRS-derived signal features. Attention\
  \ decrement occurred during the task as revealed by the significant increase in\
  \ reaction time in the last 10 compared to the first 10 minutes of the task (p<.05).\
  \ The results demonstrate relatively good classification accuracy, ranging from\
  \ 65 to 90%. The highest classification accuracy results were obtained when exploiting\
  \ the oxyhemoglobin signals (i.e., from 77 to 89%, depending on the cortical area\
  \ considered) rather than the deoxyhemoglobin signals (i.e., from 65 to 66%). Moreover,\
  \ the classification accuracy increased to 90% when using signals from the right\
  \ parietal area rather than from the prefrontal cortex. The results support the\
  \ feasibility of developing cognitive tracking technologies using NIRS and machine\
  \ learning techniques. \xA9 2014 Derosi\xE8re et al."
