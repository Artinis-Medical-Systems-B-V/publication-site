abstract: "This study examines the effects of inspiratory muscle warm-up (IMW) on\
  \ performance and muscle oxygenation during cycling exercise. In a randomized crossover\
  \ study of 10 female soccer players, the IMW, placebo (IMWP) and control (CON) trials\
  \ were conducted before two 6-min submaximal cycling exercises (100 and 150W) followed\
  \ by intermittent high-intensity sprint (IHIS, 6\xD710s with 60s recovery). The\
  \ reduction in tissue saturation index (TSI) in legs in the IMW were significantly\
  \ less than those in IMWP and CON (P<0.01) during submaximal cycling exercises.\
  \ The average reduction in TSI during the IHIS test with IMW was significantly less\
  \ than those in the IMWP and CON (P=0.023). Nevertheless, the IHIS performance with\
  \ IMW did not differ from that in other trials. In conclusion, the leg TSI during\
  \ continuous submaximal cycling exercise followed by intermittent sprinting was\
  \ likely improved by specific IMW (40% maximal inspiratory mouth pressure), which\
  \ did not enhance IHIS performance. \xA9 2013 Elsevier B.V."
