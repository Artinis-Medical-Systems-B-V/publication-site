abstract: Physical exercise plays a crucial role in the development of cognition and
  brain functions in children. Inhibitory control is an advanced cognition that affects
  children's life and learning. In the current study, the relationship between physical
  training and inhibitory control was explored. In total, 80 children were randomly
  but equally assigned to the experimental and control groups. The experimental group
  underwent physical training (volleyball) for 60 min, thrice a week for 12 weeks.
  In contrast, the control group did not undergo any training and continued with their
  daily routines. The flanker task and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
  were employed to investigate the effects of 12-week physical training on inhibitory
  control and changes in the oxy-Hb concentration in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during
  the task. The behavioral results revealed that the experimental group performed
  better on the flanker task (e.g., shorter response time [F (1,74) = 18.420, p textless
  0.001, ηp2 = 0.199] and higher accuracy [F (1,74) = 15.00, p textless 0.001, ηp2
  = 0.169] than the control group. The oxy-Hb concentration in the right dorsolateral
  PFC (R-DLPFC) was higher and the activation level of this region was higher during
  the flanker task [F (1,74) = 6.216, p textless 0.05, ηp2 = 0.077]. Moreover, the
  McNemar test revealed improved cognitive performance in response time or accuracy
  and R-DLPFC activation induced by physical exercise coincided significantly (χ2
  = 5.49, p textless 0.05; χ2 = 6.081, p textless 0.05). These findings suggest that
  the R-DLPFC is likely the neural substrate for improved cognitive performance elicited
  by 12-week physical training.
