abstract: The present study examined the evolution of the behavioral performance,
  subjectively perceived difficulty, and hemodynamic activity of the prefrontal cortex
  as a function of cognitive load during two different cognitive tasks tapping executive
  functions. Additionally, it investigated the relationships between these behavioral,
  subjective, and neuroimaging data. Nineteen right-handed young adults (18–22 years)
  were scanned using continuous-wave functional near-infrared spectroscopy during
  the performance of n-back and random number generation tasks in three cognitive
  load conditions. Four emitter and four receptor optodes were fixed bilaterally over
  the ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices to record the hemodynamic
  changes. A self-reported scale measured the perceived difficulty. The findings of
  this study showed that an increasing cognitive load deteriorated the behavioral
  performance and increased the perceived difficulty. The hemodynamic activity increased
  parametrically for the three cognitive loads of the random number generation task
  and in a two-back and three-back compared to a one-back condition. In addition,
  the hemodynamic activity was specifically greater in the ventrolateral prefrontal
  cortex than in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for both cognitive tasks (random
  number generation and n-back tasks). Finally, the results highlighted some links
  between cerebral oxygenation and the behavioral performance, but not the subjectively
  perceived difficulty. Our results suggest that cognitive load affects the executive
  performance and perceived difficulty and that fNIRS can be used to specify the prefrontal
  cortex’s implications for executive tasks involving inhibition and working memory
  updating.
