abstract: "Resting muscle VO2 consumption (rmVO2) as measured by near-infrared spectroscopy\
  \ (NIRS) has been poorly studied in peripheral arterial disease (PAD). We studied\
  \ the feasibility of its assessment in a clinical setting, compared values from\
  \ PAD and healthy participants, and identified factors affecting rmVO2 in PAD. A\
  \ total of 119 PAD patients with claudication and 30 healthy participants were enrolled.\
  \ Ankle brachial index (ABI), adipose tissue thickness, and rmVO2 in the gastrocnemius\
  \ after venous (rmVO2ven) or arterial (rmVO 2art) occlusion were measured with NIRS.\
  \ Compared to rmVO 2art, rmVO2ven determination was less painful (P =.001), with\
  \ higher values (P <.0001). rmVO2ven of PAD patients was not significantly different\
  \ from healthy participants and was inversely correlated with the corresponding\
  \ ABI (P =.018). rmVO2ven from severely diseased legs was higher than values from\
  \ borderline/moderately diseased legs (P =.003). The determination of rmVO2ven by\
  \ NIRS is suitable for the clinical setting and allows noninvasive quantification\
  \ of a compensatory peripheral adaptation in patients with PAD. \xA9 2010 The Author(s)."
