abstract: 'Background: Worldwide >2.3 billion individuals are affected by bladder
  disease. The current evaluative test is invasive, associated with complications
  and often declined. Non-invasive evaluation of bladder hemodynamics using continuouswave
  near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is an established technique. Recently, fNIRS was
  shown to detect activity in the brain regions previously identified by fMRI to relate
  to bladder sensation and control of voiding. We now report a system for simultaneous
  wireless fNIRS measurements of bladder and brain. Method: Two dual-wavelength (760/850
  nm) fNIRS systems were used in parallel. A 23-channel array (35 mm interoptode distance)
  housed in a neoprene cap was positioned over the bilateral frontal cortex, and a
  4-channel grid of 4 emitters and 1 detector taped to the skin over the bladder.
  Natural bladder filling to capacity and spontaneous voiding were monitored in two
  volunteer subjects. Proprietary software (Oxysoft v3.2.56) linked the devices, and
  generated video and graphical displays of changes in oxygenated, de-oxygenated,
  and total hemoglobin from raw optical data recorded at 50 Hz. Results: Simultaneous
  brain and bladder data were captured in both subjects. Localized brain activity
  was evident on video as topographical colorimetric changes indicative of increases
  in oxyhemoglobin concentration in areas previously linked via fMRI to bladder sensation
  and function; signal intensity varied in relation to phases of voiding. In the bladder
  detrusor muscle oxyhemoglobin increased prior to permission to void; changes during
  uroflow differed between the symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects. Conclusion:
  Simultaneous wireless fNIRS of brain and bladder is feasible, and offers new physiological
  dimensions for evaluating bladder control and function.<br/> &copy; COPYRIGHT SPIE.
