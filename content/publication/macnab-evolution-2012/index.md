abstract: "Near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is an established non-invasive optical\
  \ technique for measuring changes in haemoglobin concentration occurring in the\
  \ microcirculation in real time. NIR spectroscopy parameters refect change in tissue\
  \ haemodynamics and oxygenation and can contribute important physiologic insights\
  \ when used alone or interpreted in parallel with other conventional measurements.\
  \ The broad use of NIR spectroscopy in research is not matched by clinical applications;\
  \ reasons include limitations inherent to the technique, using instruments designed\
  \ for research at the bedside, ambiguity regarding what NIR spectroscopy measures,\
  \ defciencies of early algorithms, and understandable expectations by clinicians\
  \ that NIR spectroscopy data are reproducible and specific enough for clinical decision\
  \ making. Such issues could be addressed by appropriate collaboration where clinicians\
  \ drive the questions which NIR spectroscopy is to answer, researchers contribute\
  \ to monitoring methodology, device design and data analysis/algorithms and both\
  \ groups utilise physiologic knowledge and practical lessons learned from prior\
  \ NIR spectroscopy studies when interpreting data. NIR spectroscopy applications\
  \ in urology are recent and offer clear opportunities for clinicians and researchers\
  \ to collaborate. Urology is a field where current clinical investigations are limited\
  \ in terms of the physiologic information they provide and because the principal\
  \ test used for evaluation of the many people who have problematic lower urinary\
  \ tract dysfunction is invasive in nature. Hence the rationale for non-invasive\
  \ transcutaneous optical monitoring of the bladder during voiding as, when the organ\
  \ contracts, changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin occur which allow\
  \ haemodynamic variations and alterations in oxygen supply and demand to be inferred.\
  \ Different patterns of change are evident in healthy and diseased tissue; these\
  \ patterns refect the effects of physiologic events observed using NIR spectroscopy\
  \ to study other tissues and provide novel insights into the causation of voiding\
  \ dysfunction. This review of the evolution of a wireless methodology for bladder\
  \ studies includes examples of effective clinician researcher collaboration, reveals\
  \ how miniature NIR spectroscopy devices make monitoring in ambulant subjects straightforward\
  \ and makes possible studies in special populations such as children and patients\
  \ with spinal cord injury. Hence, such wireless devices represent an advance of\
  \ relevance in urology and an opportunity to expand research in other fields and\
  \ progress with translation of NIR spectroscopy into other relevant clinical arenas.\
