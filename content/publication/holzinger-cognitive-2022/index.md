abstract: This paper aims to deeper study the relations between cognitive control
  and mental workload. Indeed, cognitive control is a contemporary concept in neuroscience
  and cognitive ergonomics, that can explain the metacognition carried out by operators
  in their multitasking activity, as well as the regulations that operators implement
  to manage their level of mental workload. In this paper, an experiment was conducted,
  where a main task was presented to participants in different conditions of multitasking
  and difficulty. The scenario was designed with the aid of the Multi-Attribute Task
  Battery (MATB-II) microworld, which reproduces basic multitasking that a pilot can
  carry out in an aircraft. The performance and the neurophysiological responses of
  twenty participants were recorded, especially by analyzing cardiac activity and
  oxygenation and deoxygenation of the prefrontal cortex. The findings particularly
  emphasized a link between the level of task difficulty and the control modes, which
  is highly significant for the tactical mode. Furthermore, fNIRS signals were significantly
  related to cognitive control modes. Indeed, the tactical mode was found to be the
  most efficient one, since it is associated with a satisfying performance and with
  low mental strain, contrary to the other modes with a worse performance and a higher
  mental strain. These results about the dynamic of cognitive control and the specific
  sensitivity of fNIRS to tactical control mode open new perspectives for proposing
  new ways to support this mode in naturalistic situations, particularly in the domain
  of aviation.
