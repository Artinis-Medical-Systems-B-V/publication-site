abstract: ' The majority of in vivo applications of near infrared spectroscopic (NIRS)
  monitoring use transcutaneous optode placement over the tissue of interest. Invasive
  application of optodes is occasionally described for monitoring tissue too deep
  for transcutaneous study, principally in animal models, but sometimes in humans.
  Invasive fibre-optic probes have been developed for a range of other spectroscopic
  applications including some in vivo . We describe the design and feasibility testing
  in a human subject of a vaginal probe to extend the scope of recently developed
  techniques for NIRS monitoring in urology. Design criteria included: use of optodes
  and cables with dimensions compatible with appropriate overall probe size; dual
  channel capability (for simultaneous monitoring of bladder wall and urethral sphincter);
  secure interoptode separation at correct distance for required penetration; ease
  of insertion, orientation and avoidance of movement artifact. Components were obtained
  that met design criteria and allowed use of the probe connected to a commercial
  NIRS instrument. Iterative development established optimal interoptode distance
  and secure positioning of a probe that could be housed for in vivo study within
  a disposable vaginal speculum. The feasibility of monitoring changes in chromophore
  concentration in the bladder detrusor and urethral sphincter using this intravaginal
  probe was evident from four separate studies during voiding and a series of physiologic
  events (cough, Valsalva and Kiegel contractions) in a healthy female volunteer.
  This small series suggests that reproducible data free of movement artifact, with
  consistent patterns and magnitudes of chromophore change can be obtained with the
  probe designed.'
