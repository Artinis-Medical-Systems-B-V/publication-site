abstract: "Background Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements of oxygenation\
  \ reflectO2 delivery and utilization in exercising muscle and may improve detection\
  \ of a critical exercise threshold. Purpose First, to detect an oxygenation breakpoint\
  \ ($\u0394$[O2HbMb-HHbMb]-BP) and compare this breakpoint to ventilatory thresholds\
  \ during a maximal incremental test across sexes and training status. Second, to\
  \ assess reproducibility of NIRS signals and exercise thresholds and investigate\
  \ confounding effects of adipose tissue thickness on NIRS measurements. Methods\
  \ Forty subjects (10 trained male cyclists, 10 trained female cyclists, 11 endurance\
  \ trained males and 9 recreationally trained males) performed maximal incremental\
  \ cycling exercise to determine $\u0394$[O2HbMb-HHbMb]-BP and ventilatory thresholds\
  \ (VT1 and VT2). Muscle haemoglobin and myoglobin O2 oxygenation ([HHbMb], [O2HbMb],\
  \ SmO2) was determined in m. vastus lateralis. $\u0394$[O2HbMb-HHbMb]-BPwas determined\
  \ by double linear regression. Trained cyclists performed the maximal incremental\
  \ test twice to assess reproducibility. Adipose tissue thickness (ATT) was determined\
  \ by skinfold measurements. Results $\u0394$[O2HbMb-HHbMb]-BPwas not different from\
  \ VT1, but only moderately related (r = 0.58- 0.63, p<0.001). VT1 was different\
  \ across sexes and training status, whereas $\u0394$[O2HbMb-HHbMb]-BP differed only\
  \ across sexes. Reproducibilitywas high for SmO2 (ICC = 0.69- 0.97), $\u0394$[O2HbMb-HHbMb]-BP\
  \ (ICC = 0.80-0.88) and ventilatory thresholds (ICC = 0.96- 0.99).SmO2 at peak exercise\
  \ and at occlusion were strongly related to adipose tissue thickness (r2 = 0.81,\
  \ p<0.001; r2 = 0.79, p<0.001). Moreover, ATT was related to asymmetric changes\
  \ in $\u0394$[HHbMb] and $\u0394$[O2HbMb] during incremental exercise (r = -0.64,\
  \ p<0.001) and during occlusion (r = -0.50, p<0.05). Conclusion Although the oxygenation\
  \ threshold is reproducible and potentially a suitable exercise threshold, VT1 discriminates\
  \ better across sexes and training status during maximal stepwise incremental exercise.\
  \ Continuous-wave NIRS measurements are reproducible, but strongly affected by adipose\
  \ tissue thickness."
