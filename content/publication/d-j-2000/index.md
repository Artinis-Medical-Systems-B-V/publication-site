abstract: "Background and Purpose - With increasing age, assuming the upright position\
  \ is more often accompanied by symptoms such as dizziness and lightheadedness, possibly\
  \ as a result of a diminished oxygen supply to the brain due to impaired cerebral\
  \ autoregulation. We aimed to quantify postural changes in cerebral oxygenation\
  \ and systemic hemodynamics in healthy elderly and young subjects. Methods - In\
  \ 18 healthy elderly subjects (aged 70 to 83 years) and 10 healthy young subjects\
  \ (aged 22 to 45 years), frontal cortical oxygenation and hemodynamic responses\
  \ were continuously monitored by near infrared spectroscopy and Finapres, respectively,\
  \ before and during 10 minutes of active standing. Results - Cortical oxyhemoglobin\
  \ concentration [O2Hb] decreased by -4.6\xB12.2 $\u03BC$mol/L (P<0.001) and cortical\
  \ deoxyhemoglobin concentration increased by 1.5\xB12.4 $\u03BC$mol/L (P<0.05) in\
  \ the elderly subjects after posture change, whereas these variables did not change\
  \ significantly in the young subjects. The postural hemodynamic changes tended to\
  \ be attenuated in the elderly subjects, except for the increases in systolic blood\
  \ pressure (BP). Smaller postural increases in diastolic BP were related to larger\
  \ [O2Hb] decreases (r=0.53, P<0.01, corrected for the age effect). Conclusions -\
  \ Assuming the upright position evokes an asymptomatic decrease in frontal cortical\
  \ oxygenation in healthy elderly subjects but not in healthy young subjects. Cortical\
  \ [O2Hb] changes are affected by diastolic BP changes. These findings may indicate\
  \ that regulation of cerebral oxygenation alters with increasing age."
