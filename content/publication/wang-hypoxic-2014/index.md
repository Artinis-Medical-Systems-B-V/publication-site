abstract: "Background Circulating progenitor cells (CPCs) improve cardiovascular function\
  \ and organ perfusion by enhancing the capacities of endothelial repair and neovasculogenesis.\
  \ This study investigates whether exercise regimens with/without hypoxia affect\
  \ cardiac and muscular hemodynamics by modulating CPCs and angiogenic factors. Methods\
  \ Forty sedentary males were randomly divided into hypoxic (HT, n = 20) and normoxic\
  \ (NT, n = 20) training groups. The subjects were trained on a bicycle ergometer\
  \ at 60%VO2max under 15% (HT) or 21% (NT) O2 conditions for 30 min daily, five days\
  \ weekly for five weeks. Results After the five-week interventions, the HT group\
  \ exhibited a larger improvement in aerobic capacity than the NT group. Furthermore,\
  \ the HT regimen (i) enhanced cardiac output (QH) and perfusion (Q M)/oxygenation\
  \ of vastus lateralis during exercise; (ii) increased levels of CD34+/KDR+/CD117+,\
  \ CD34 +/KDR+/CD133+, and CD34+/KDR +/CD31+ cells in blood; (iii) promoted the proliferative\
  \ capacity of these CPC subsets, and (iv) elevated plasma nitrite/nitrate, stromal\
  \ cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and vascular\
  \ endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) concentrations. Despite the lack of changes\
  \ in QH and the number or proliferative capacity of CD34 +/KDR+/CD117+ or CD34+/KDR\
  \ +/CD31+ cells, the NT regimen elevated both QM and plasma nitrite/nitrate levels\
  \ and suppressed the shedding of endothelial cells (CD34-/KDR+/phosphatidylserine+\
  \ cells). Conclusions The HT regimen improves cardiac and muscular hemodynamic adaptations,\
  \ possibly by promoting the mobilization/function of CPCs and the production of\
  \ angiogenic factors. \xA9 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."
