abstract: This study examined the effects of acute tobacco smoking on cerebral oxygenation
  and autonomic function in 28 male, habitual smokers of shorter young smokers (YSM)
  or longer middle-aged smokers (MSM) smoking history. Following baseline testing,
  participants undertook a smoking protocol involving the consumption of two cigarettes
  within 15 min. Measures of cerebral oxygenation and autonomic function were collected
  before, during, and 0 min, 30 min, 1 h, and 4 h post-smoking. Tissue saturation
  index (TSI) for MSM was greater than YSM during cigarette consumption (p < 0.05).
  Moreover, MSM observed significant within-group changes for TSI during and post-cigarette
  consumption (p < 0.05). Further, MSM observed an increase in low frequency (LF)
  band from 30 min to 1 h post-consumption, followed by a decline, whereas elevations
  above MSM were observed in YSM at 4 h (p < 0.05). Both MSM and YSM showed a decrease
  in high-frequency (HF) band post-cigarette, while increased LF/HF ratio post-consumption
  was observed in YSM. A decline in the standard deviation of RR intervals, post-cigarette
  consumption was evident in MSM (p < 0.05). Moreover, the root mean square of RR
  interval in both groups similarly decreased following cigarette consumption (p <
  0.05). Acute smoking affects heart rate variability, suggestive of vagal withdrawal,
  and maybe indicate an effect of smoking history. Additionally, prolonged smoking
  history alters cerebral microcirculatory responses to acute tobacco exposure in
  MSM.
