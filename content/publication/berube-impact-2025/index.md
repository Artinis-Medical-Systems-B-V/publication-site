abstract: The aim of this study was to measure the effects of chronic and acute aerobic
  exercise at two different intensities on cognitive performance and cerebrovascular
  response in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients. Thirty‐five CHD patients completed
  two exercise bouts at 30% and 70% of their respective peak aerobic power on an ergocycle
  while performing cognitive tasks, which included nonexecutive and executive conditions
  before and after a 3‐month training intervention. Variations of oxy‐ deoxy‐ and
  total hemoglobin concentrations were measured on the left prefrontal cortex at both
  intensities using near‐infrared spectroscopy. Aerobic exercise training consisted
  of linear and nonlinear periodization protocols for three sessions of 30–50 min
  per week for 12 weeks. Error rate (p textless 0.001) and reaction time (p textless 0.001)
  improved after the training program for the executive condition of the cognitive
  task, regardless of intensity and training groups. Cerebral oxygenation remained
  similar pre and post intervention for all conditions and acute exercise intensity.
  Despite the absence of conjunction between cerebral oxygenation and cognition, results
  suggest that both exercise training programs could improve cognition in CHD patients
  during acute exercise.
