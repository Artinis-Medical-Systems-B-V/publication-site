abstract: "New Findings: What is the central question of the study? Cuff-occlusion\
  \ duration may influence contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) assessments of skeletal\
  \ muscle microvascular blood flow responsiveness: what are the effects of 1, 3 and\
  \ 5\_min cuff-occlusion on the magnitude and reliability of calf muscle microvascular\
  \ blood flow responsiveness in older adults? What is the main finding and its importance?\
  \ Calf muscle microvascular blood flow responsiveness was enhanced following 5\_\
  min cuff-occlusion compared with 1\_min. The reliability of post-occlusion CEUS\
  \ measurements was also improved following 5\_min occlusion. The use of a standardized\
  \ 5\_min occlusion period should therefore be considered in future studies and clinical\
  \ practice. Abstract: Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is increasingly used in\
  \ assessments of skeletal muscle microvascular blood flow responsiveness. In response\
  \ to limb cuff-occlusion, some studies have reported significant impairments in\
  \ CEUS measurements of microvascular blood flow in older adults with cardiovascular\
  \ or metabolic disease, whereas others have failed to detect significant between-group\
  \ differences, which has brought the reliability of the technique into question.\
  \ In the absence of a standardized CEUS protocol, there is variance in the duration\
  \ of cuff-occlusion used, which is likely to influence post-occlusion measurements\
  \ of muscle microvascular blood flow. We aimed to determine the effect of cuff-occlusion\
  \ duration by comparing the magnitude and reliability of CEUS measurements of calf\
  \ muscle microvascular blood flow responsiveness in older adults (n\_=\_15, 67\_\
  \xB1\_11\_years) following 1, 3 and 5\_min occlusion periods. Microvascular blood\
  \ flow (=\_microvascular volume \xD7 microvascular velocity) within the calf muscle\
  \ was measured using real-time destruction\u2013replenishment CEUS. Measurements\
  \ were made following thigh cuff-occlusion (200\_mmHg) periods of 1, 3 and 5\_min\
  \ in a random order. Microvascular blood flow was higher following 3\_min (3.71\_\
  \xB1\_1.46\_aU\_s\u22121) and 5\_min (3.47\_\xB1\_1.48\_aU\_s\u22121) compared with\
  \ 1\_min (2.42\_\xB1\_1.27\_aU\_s\u22121, P\_=\_0.002), which corresponded with\
  \ higher microvascular volumes after 3 and 5\_min compared with 1\_min. Reliability\
  \ was good following 5\_min (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.49) compared\
  \ with poor following 1 min (ICC 0.34) and 3 min (ICC 0.35). This study demonstrates\
  \ that the magnitude and reliability of calf muscle microvascular responsiveness\
  \ is enhanced using a 5\_min cuff-occlusion protocol compared with 1 min in older\
  \ adults."
