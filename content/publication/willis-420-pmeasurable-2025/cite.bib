 abstract = {This observational cross-sectional study investigated the sensitivity of the Segmental Assessment of Trunk Control (SATCo) to detect differences in neutral vertical (NV) head and trunk control between children with neuromuscular disorders (NMD) and typically developing (TD) children. A convenience sample of 19 children with NMD (10y6m(3y7m), 2 female) and 19 TD children (7y10m(4y12m), 6 female) was tested with SATCo. Statistical analysis was performed with linear mixed-effects models (LME). Measurably different SATCo scores were found between conditions (NMD vs TD, F(1,39.6)=151.0,p\textless.001), segments (seven trunk segments, F(6,138.3)=23.3,p\textless.001), control type (static, active, and reactive control, F(2,33.0)=6.3,p=.005), and interactions condition x segment (F(6,138.3)=23.3,p\textless.001) and condition x control type (F(2,33.0)=6.3,p=.005). In a subset of 10 children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a significant inverse correlation found between active control and age confirmed measurable decline in trunk control as they age. SATCo was shown to be sensitive to differences in trunk control status in NMD vs TD. Children with NMD presented a measurable trunk control deficit at varying segments, even when still ambulant. This deficit is not identified by functional assessments but is critical to functional abilities. The potential of SATCo as an outcome measure for therapeutic interventions and treatment efficacy needs further study.},
