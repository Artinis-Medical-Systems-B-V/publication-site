abstract: This observational cross-sectional study investigated the sensitivity of
  the Segmental Assessment of Trunk Control (SATCo) to detect differences in neutral
  vertical (NV) head and trunk control between children with neuromuscular disorders
  (NMD) and typically developing (TD) children. A convenience sample of 19 children
  with NMD (10y6m(3y7m), 2 female) and 19 TD children (7y10m(4y12m), 6 female) was
  tested with SATCo. Statistical analysis was performed with linear mixed-effects
  models (LME). Measurably different SATCo scores were found between conditions (NMD
  vs TD, F(1,39.6)=151.0,ptextless.001), segments (seven trunk segments, F(6,138.3)=23.3,ptextless.001),
  control type (static, active, and reactive control, F(2,33.0)=6.3,p=.005), and interactions
  condition x segment (F(6,138.3)=23.3,ptextless.001) and condition x control type
  (F(2,33.0)=6.3,p=.005). In a subset of 10 children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy,
  a significant inverse correlation found between active control and age confirmed
  measurable decline in trunk control as they age. SATCo was shown to be sensitive
  to differences in trunk control status in NMD vs TD. Children with NMD presented
  a measurable trunk control deficit at varying segments, even when still ambulant.
  This deficit is not identified by functional assessments but is critical to functional
  abilities. The potential of SATCo as an outcome measure for therapeutic interventions
  and treatment efficacy needs further study.
