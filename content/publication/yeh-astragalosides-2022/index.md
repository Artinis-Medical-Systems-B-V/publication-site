abstract: Astragalosides have been shown to enhance endurance exercise capacity in
  vivo and promote muscular hypertrophy in vitro. However, it remains unknown whether
  astragalosides supplementation can alter inflammatory response and enhance muscle
  recovery after damage in humans. We therefore aimed to evaluate the effect of astragalosides
  supplementation on muscle’s intrinsic capacity to regenerate and repair itself after
  exercise-induced damage. Using a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over
  design, eleven male participants underwent 7 days of astragalosides supplementation
  (in total containing 4 mg of astragalosides per day) or a placebo control, following
  an eccentric exercise protocol. Serum blood samples and variables related to muscle
  function were collected prior to and immediately following the muscle damage protocol
  and also at 2 h, and 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 days of the recovery period, to assess the
  pro-inflammatory cytokine response, the secretion of muscle regenerative factors,
  and muscular strength. Astragalosides supplementation reduced biomarkers of skeletal
  muscle damage (serum CK, LDH, and Mb), when compared to the placebo, at 1, 2, and
  3 days following the muscle damage protocol. Astragalosides supplementation suppressed
  the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α, whilst increasing the release of IGF-1 during the
  initial stages of muscle recovery. Furthermore, following astragaloside supplementation,
  muscular strength returned to baseline 2 days earlier than the placebo. Astragalosides
  supplementation shortens the duration of inflammation, enhances the regeneration
  process and restores muscle strength following eccentric exercise-induced injury.
