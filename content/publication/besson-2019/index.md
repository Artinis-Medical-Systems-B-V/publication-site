abstract: Functional targeting with anodal high-definition transcranial direct current
  stimulation (HD-atDCS) of involved brain areas during performance of a motor task
  (online) may facilitate sensorimotor cortex neuroplasticity compared to performing
  the motor task after HD-atDCS (offline). The aim of this study was to employ functional
  near-infrared spectroscopy to compare the time course of motor task-related changes
  in sensorimotor cortex activation between online and offline HD-atDCS. We hypothesized
  that online HD-atDCS would have a greater effect on task-related sensorimotor cortex
  activation than offline HD-atDCS. In a within-subject sham controlled and randomized
  study design, 9 healthy participants underwent 3 HD-atDCS sessions (online, offline
  and sham) targeting the left sensorimotor cortex separated by 1 week. Functional
  near-infrared spectroscopy hemodynamic changes were measured from the left sensorimotor
  cortex during a simple finger opposition motor task before (Pre), immediately (T1)
  and 30 min after (T2) each session. The movement rates were not different between
  (online, offline, sham) or within (Pre, T1, T2) sessions. At T2, online HD-atDCS
  was associated with a significant increase (large effect size) in sensorimotor cortex
  activation (Hedges g = 1.01, p < 0.001) when compared to sham; there was a nonsignificant
  trend to increase activation between offline and sham (Hedges g = 0.52, p = 0.05)
  and between online and offline (Hedges g = 0.53, p = 0.06). Concurrent application
  of HD-atDCS during a motor task may produce larger sensorimotor cortex activation
  than sequential application.
