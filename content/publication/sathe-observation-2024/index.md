abstract: Introduction This study aimed to investigate the differences in cerebral
  cortex activation during a static balance task between sporting and non-sporting
  groups using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The Clinical Test of
  Sensory Interaction on Balance (CTSIB) was employed to assess balance performance
  in both groups. Method The study involved 70 participants, assigned into 2 equal
  groups; the sporting (N = 35) and non sporting (N = 35) group. Hemodynamic changes
  measured as oxyhemoglobin (oxy-Hb) and deoxyhemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) concentrations,
  were recorded using a portable fNIRS system. Results The results revealed significant
  differences in CTSIB scores between the sporting and non-sporting groups in five
  out of the six balance conditions. The sporting group showed superior balance performance
  compared to the non-sporting group. The fNIRS data showed activation patterns in
  various regions of interest (ROIs), including the occipito-parietal, prefrontal,
  and temporo-parietal regions. Differences in activation between the two groups were
  observed in the occipito-parietal and prefrontal cortex regions, indicating distinct
  neural responses during the balance task. Conclusion These findings suggest that
  regular participation in sports activities may contribute to improved balance control
  and associated changes in cerebral cortex activation. The activation patterns observed
  in different cortical areas provide valuable insights into the neural mechanisms
  underlying static balance and the potential effects of sporting activities on balance
  control. The research findings offer insights for targeted interventions aimed at
  improving balance in both athletes and non-athletes. These interventions have the
  potential to reduce the risk of falls and enhance overall physical performance,
  benefiting a diverse range of individuals.
