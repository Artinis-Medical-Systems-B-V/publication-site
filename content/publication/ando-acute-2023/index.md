abstract: Abstract  Hypoxia has the potential to impair cognitive function; however,
  it is still uncertain which cognitive domains are adversely affected. We examined
  the effects of acute hypoxia (∼7 h) on central executive (Go/No‐Go) and non‐executive
  (memory) tasks and the extent to which impairment was potentially related to regional
  cerebral blood flow and oxygen delivery (CDO 2 ). Twelve male participants performed
  cognitive tasks following 0, 2, 4 and 6 h of passive exposure to both normoxia and
  hypoxia (12% O 2 ), in a randomized block cross‐over single‐blinded design. Middle
  cerebral artery (MCA) and posterior cerebral artery (PCA) blood velocities and corresponding
  CDO 2 were determined using bilateral transcranial Doppler ultrasound. In hypoxia,
  MCA DO 2 was reduced during the Go/No‐Go task ( P = 0.010 vs. normoxia, main effect),
  and PCA DO 2 was attenuated during memorization ( P = 0.005 vs. normoxia) and recall
  components ( P = 0.002 vs. normoxia) in the memory task. The accuracy of the memory
  task was also impaired in hypoxia ( P = 0.049 vs. normoxia). In contrast, hypoxia
  failed to alter reaction time ( P = 0.19 vs. normoxia) or accuracy ( P = 0.20 vs.
  normoxia) during the Go/No‐Go task, indicating that selective attention and response
  inhibition were preserved. Hypoxia did not affect cerebral blood flow or corresponding
  CDO 2 responses to cognitive activity ( P textgreater 0.05 vs. normoxia). Collectively,
  these findings highlight the differential sensitivity of cognitive domains, with
  memory being selectively vulnerable in hypoxia.    New Findings     What is the
  central question of this study?  We sought to examine the effects of acute hypoxia
  on central executive (selective attention and response inhibition) and non‐executive
  (memory) performance and the extent to which impairments are potentially related
  to reductions in regional cerebral blood flow and oxygen delivery.    What is the
  main finding and its importance?  Memory was impaired in acute hypoxia, and this
  was accompanied by a selective reduction in posterior cerebral artery oxygen delivery.
  In contrast, selective attention and response inhibition remained well preserved.
  These findings suggest that memory is selectively vulnerable to hypoxia.
