abstract: 'Abstract  Purpose  According to the homeostasis model, patellofemoral pain
  (PFP) results from disturbed homeostasis due to vascular insufficiency in the anterior
  knee. Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) measures relative changes in concentrations
  (in µmol/cm 2 ) of (de-)oxygenated hemoglobine (HHb and O 2 Hb). The aims were to:
  1) investigate the characteristics of the NIRS signal derived from the patella during
  experiments affecting hemodynamics in healthy controls, and 2) determine the test–retest
  reliability of NIRS in positions clinically relevant for PFP patients.    Methods  Two
  experiments were conducted on 10 healthy controls and analysed using Student’s t
  -test. Reliability ( ICC  2,1  ) was evaluated for two activities (‘Prolonged Sitting’
  and ‘Stair Descent’) in five PFP patients and 15 healthy controls, performed twice
  within five days.    Results  The NIRS signal (HHb and O 2 Hb) showed a statistically
  significant increase ( p textless .001 – .002) on all optodes (30, 35, 40 mm) during
  ‘Venous Occlusion’ ( M = 1.0 – 2.0), while it showed no statistically significant
  change ( p = .075 – .61) during ‘Skin Compression’ ( M = -0.9 – 0.9) on the 30 and
  35 mm optode. Reliability of NIRS (HHb and O 2 Hb) ranged from moderate to almost
  perfect ( ICC  2,1  = .47 – .95) on the 30 mm optode for ‘Prolonged Sitting’, and
  from moderate to substantial ( ICC  2,1  = .50 – .68) on the 35 mm optode for ‘Stair
  Descent’.    Conclusions Patella NIRS measurements are affected by venous occlusion,
  but not by skin compression, and are sufficiently reliable as research application
  to compare real-time patellar bone hemodynamics. These insights may assist to improve
  effectiveness of evidence-based treatment strategies for PFP.   Trial registration
