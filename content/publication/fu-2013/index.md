abstract: "Background: Abnormal ventilatory/hemodynamic responses to exercise contribute\
  \ to functional impairment in patients with heart failure (HF). This study investigates\
  \ how interval and continuous exercise regimens influence functional capacity by\
  \ modulating ventilatory efficiency and hemodynamic function in HF patients. Methods:\
  \ Forty-five HF patients were randomized to perform either aerobic interval training\
  \ (AIT; 3-minute intervals at 40% and 80% VO2peak) or moderate continuous training\
  \ (MCT; sustained 60% VO 2peak) for 30 min/day, 3 days/week for 12 weeks, or to\
  \ a control group that received general healthcare (GHC). A noninvasive bio-reactance\
  \ device was adopted to measure cardiac hemodynamics, whereas a near-infrared spectroscopy\
  \ was employed to assess perfusion/O2 extraction in frontal cerebral lobe (\xE2\u0302\
  \u2020[THb]FC / \xE2\u0302\u2020[HHb]FC) and vastus lateralis (\xE2\u0302\u2020\
  [THb]VL / \xE2\u0302\u2020[HHb] VL), respectively. Results: Following the 12-week\
  \ intervention, the AIT group exhibited higher oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES)\
  \ and lower VE-VCO2 slope than the MCT and GHC groups. Furthermore, AIT, but not\
  \ MCT, boosted cardiac output (CO) and increased \xE2\u0302 \u2020[THb]FC, \xE2\u0302\
  \u2020[THb]VL, and \xE2\u0302\u2020[HHb]VL during exercise. In multivariate analyses,\
  \ CO was the dominant predictor of VO2peak. \xE2\u0302\u2020[THb]FC and \xE2\u0302\
  \u2020[THb] VL, which modulated the correlation between CO and OUES, were significantly\
  \ correlated with OUES. Simultaneously, \xE2\u0302\u2020[THb] VL was the only factor\
  \ significantly associated with V E-VCO2 slope. Additionally, AIT reduced plasma\
  \ brain natriuretic peptide, myeloperoxidase, and interleukin-6 levels and increased\
  \ the Short Form-36 physical/mental component scores and decreased the Minnesota\
  \ Living with Heart Failure questionnaire score. Conclusions: AIT effectively improves\
  \ oxygen uptake efficiency by enhancing cerebral/muscular hemodynamics and suppresses\
  \ oxidative stress/inflammation associated with cardiac dysfunction, and also promotes\
  \ generic/disease-specific qualities of life in patients with HF. \xA9 2011 Elsevier\
