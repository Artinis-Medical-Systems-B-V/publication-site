abstract: "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the composite, intra-individual,\
  \ and inter-individual patterns of responses for deoxygenated hemoglobin and myoglobin\
  \ (deoxy[heme]), oxygenated hemoglobin and myoglobin (oxy[heme]), total hemoglobin\
  \ and myoglobin (total[heme]), and tissue saturation index (StO2%) during fatiguing,\
  \ maximal, isokinetic, unilateral, and bilateral leg extensions. Methods: Nine men\
  \ (Mean \xB1 SD; age = 21.9 \xB1 2.4 years; height = 181.8 \xB1 11.9 cm; body mass\
  \ = 85.8 \xB1 6.2 kg) performed 50 unilateral and bilateral maximal, concentric,\
  \ isokinetic leg extensions at 180\xB0 s\u22121 on two separate visits. The muscle\
  \ oxygenation parameters assessed with near-infrared spectroscopy from the dominant\
  \ leg and isokinetic torque were averaged for 2 consecutive repetitions at 5 repetition\
  \ intervals. Separate 2 (Condition [Unilateral and Bilateral]) \xD7 10 (Repetition\
  \ [5\u201350]) repeated measures ANOVAs were performed to examine mean differences\
  \ for normalized isokinetic torque and each muscle oxygenation parameter. Intra-\
  \ and inter-individual differences were examined with polynomial regression analyses.\
  \ Results: For normalized isokinetic torque, the unilateral condition (56.3 \xB1\
  \ 10.5%) exhibited greater performance fatigability than the bilateral condition\
  \ (45.0 \xB1 18.7%). Collapsed across Condition, deoxy[heme] exhibited an increase\
  \ (p < 0.001), while StO2% exhibited a decrease (p < 0.001). The bilateral condition\
  \ exhibited a more sustained decline in oxy[heme] than the unilateral condition\
  \ (p = 0.005). Deoxy[heme], oxy[heme], and total[heme] exhibited substantial intra-\
  \ and inter-individual differences for the fatigue-induced patterns of response.\
  \ Conclusion: The present findings indicated that the greater performance fatigability\
  \ for unilateral versus bilateral fatiguing, maximal, isokinetic leg extensions\
  \ was not attributable to differences in muscle oxygenation. Future studies of muscle\
  \ oxygenation should report individual and composite fatigue-induced patterns of\
  \ responses due to the substantial intra- and inter-individual variabilities."
