abstract: "Purpose The purpose of this study was to compare the development and etiology\
  \ of neuromuscular fatigue of the knee extensor muscles at different muscle-tendon\
  \ unit (MTU) lengths during repeated maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC)\
  \ between boys and men. Methods Twenty-two prepubertal boys (9-11 yr) and 22 men\
  \ (18-30 yr) performed three knee extensor fatigue protocols at short (SHORT), optimal\
  \ (OPT), and long (LONG) MTU lengths, consisting of repeating 5-s MVIC interspersed\
  \ with 5-s passive recovery periods until torque reached 60% of the initial MVIC\
  \ torque. The etiology of neuromuscular fatigue was identified using noninvasive\
  \ methods such as surface electromyography, near-infrared spectroscopy, magnetic\
  \ nerve stimulation and twitch interpolation technique. Results The number of repetitions\
  \ was significantly lower in men at OPT (14.8 \xB1 3.2) and LONG (15.8 \xB1 5.8)\
  \ than boys (39.7 \xB1 18.4 and 29.5 \xB1 10.2, respectively; P < 0.001), whereas\
  \ no difference was found at SHORT between both age groups (boys, 33.7 \xB1 15.4;\
  \ men, 40.9 \xB1 14.2). At OPT and LONG boys showed a lower reduction in the single\
  \ potentiated twitch (Qtwpot) and a greater decrease in the voluntary activation\
  \ level than men. At SHORT, both populations displayed a moderate Qtwpot decrement\
  \ and a significant voluntary activation reduction (P < 0.001). The differences\
  \ in maximal torque between boys and men were almost twice greater at OPT (223.9\
  \ N\u02D9m) than at SHORT (123.3 N\u02D9m) and LONG (136.5 N\u02D9m). Conclusions\
  \ The differences in neuromuscular fatigue between children and adults are dependent\
  \ on MTU length. Differences in maximal torque could underpin differences in neuromuscular\
  \ fatigue between children and adults at OPT and SHORT. However, at LONG these differences\
  \ do not seem to be explained by differences in maximal torque. The origins of this\
  \ specific effect of MTU length remain to be determined."
