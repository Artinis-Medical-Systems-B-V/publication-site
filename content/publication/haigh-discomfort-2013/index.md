abstract: "In five experiments we measured the amplitude of the haemodynamic response\
  \ to visual patterns using near infrared spectroscopy of the visual cortex. The\
  \ patterns were gratings with bars that differed in chromaticity but not in luminance.\
  \ In all experiments, with a wide range of chromaticities of the grating bars, the\
  \ amplitude of the haemodynamic response increased with the separation of the chromaticities\
  \ in the CIE 1976 UCS diagram. The amplitude did not vary consistently with the\
  \ cone activation, or with the signal in colour difference channels. In four further\
  \ experiments, again with a wide range of chromaticities, the gratings were rated\
  \ for visual comfort. Discomfort increased consistently with the separation of the\
  \ chromaticities. Given that a large haemodynamic response to patterns is generally\
  \ associated with headache, we suggest that the discomfort may be a homeostatic\
  \ signal to reduce sustained metabolic load on the visual cortex. \xA9 2013."
