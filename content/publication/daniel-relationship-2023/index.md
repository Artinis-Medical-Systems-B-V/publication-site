abstract: 'In the scientific literature focused on surface electromyography (sEMG)
  and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), which have been described together
  and separately many times, presenting different possible applications, researchers
  have explored a diverse range of topics related to these advanced physiological
  measurement techniques. However, the analysis of the two signals and their interrelationships
  continues to be a focus of study in both static and dynamic movements. The main
  purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between signals during dynamic
  movements. To carry out the analysis described, the authors of this research paper
  chose two sports exercise protocols: the Astrand–Rhyming Step Test and the Astrand
  Treadmill Test. In this study, oxygen consumption and muscle activity were recorded
  from the gastrocnemius muscle of the left leg of five female participants. This
  study found positive correlations between EMG and fNIRS signals in all participants:
  0.343–0.788 (median-Pearson) and 0.192–0.832 (median-Spearman). On the treadmill,
  the signal correlations between the participants with the most active and least
  active lifestyle achieved the following medians: 0.788 (Pearson)/0.832 (Spearman)
  and 0.470 (Pearson)/0.406 (Spearman), respectively. The shapes of the changes in
  the EMG and fNIRS signals during exercise suggest a mutual relationship during dynamic
  movements. Furthermore, during the treadmill test, a higher correlation was observed
  between the EMG and NIRS signals in participants with a more active lifestyle. Due
  to the sample size, the results should be interpreted with caution.'
