abstract: "Objective: Increase in arterial inflow to the lower limbs is important\
  \ to obtain functional improvement in peripheral artery disease (PAD) patients with\
  \ claudication. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of electrical stimulation\
  \ of calf muscles on arterial inflow and tissue oxygen content in PAD in the area\
  \ of stimulation. Methods: Fifteen adult patients [mean (standard deviation) age,\
  \ 62 (12) years; height, 165 (8) cm; weight, 76 (13) kg; lowest ankle-brachial index\
  \ 0.66 (0.19)] with stable arterial claudication were recruited. All patients performed\
  \ a treadmill test (3.2 km/h, 10% slope) associated with a transcutaneous oximetry\
  \ test expressed as decrease from rest of oxygen pressure (DROP) index values (calf\
  \ changes minus chest changes from rest) with a maximum walking distance (median\
  \ [25th/75th percentiles]) of 295 [133-881] m. The DROP index on the symptomatic\
  \ side was -25 [-18/-34] mm Hg. On another day the patients underwent electrical\
  \ stimulation in the seated position on the leg that was the most symptomatic on\
  \ the treadmill. After resting values were recorded, the gastrocnemius was stimulated\
  \ for 20 minutes at increasing contraction rates at 5-minute steps of 60, 75, 86,\
  \ and 100 bpm on the most symptomatic side. Arterial blood inflow with duplex Doppler\
  \ ultrasound scanning of the femoral artery, DROP transcutaneous oxygen pressure\
  \ value, and oxygen concentration (O2Hb) from the near-infrared spectroscopic signal\
  \ of the calf were recorded on both sides. Patients were instructed to report eventual\
  \ contraction-induced pain in the stimulated calf. Results are given as mean (standard\
  \ deviation) or median [25th/75th percentiles] according to distribution, and the\
  \ level of statistical significance was set at P <.05 on two-tailed tests. Results:\
  \ Lower limb inflow (mL/min) was 64 [48/86] vs 63 [57/81] (P >.05) before stimulation,\
  \ 123 [75/156] vs 57 [44/92] (P <.01) at 60 bpm, 127 [91/207] vs 49 [43/68] (P <.01)\
  \ at 75 bpm, 140 [84/200] vs 57 [45/71] (P <.01) at 86 bpm, and 154 [86/185] vs\
  \ 55 [46/94] (P <.01) at 100 bpm on the stimulated vs nonstimulated limb, respectively.\
  \ No apparent decrease or significant leg difference was observed in DROP index\
  \ or O2Hb values. None of the patients reported contraction-induced pain in the\
  \ leg. Conclusions: Electrical stimulation of calf muscle with the Veinoplus device\
  \ results in a significant increase of arterial inflow without measurable muscle\
  \ ischemia or pain. Potential use of this device as an adjuvant treatment to improve\
  \ walking capacity in PAD patients remains to be evaluated. \xA9 2013 Society for\
