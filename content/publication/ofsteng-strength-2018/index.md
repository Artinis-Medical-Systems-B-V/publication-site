abstract: "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of adding strength\
  \ training with or without vibration to cross-country (XC) skiers' endurance training\
  \ on double-poling (DP) performance, physiological, and kinematic adaptations. Twenty-one\
  \ well-trained male XC-skiers combined endurance- and upper-body strength training\
  \ three times per week, either with (n\_=\_11) or without (n\_=\_10) superimposed\
  \ vibrations for 8\_weeks, whereas eight skiers performed endurance training only\
  \ (CON). Testing included 1RM in upper-body exercises, work economy, neural activation,\
  \ oxygen saturation in muscle, and DP kinematics during a prolonged submaximal DP\
  \ roller ski test which was directly followed by a time to exhaustion (TTE) test.\
  \ TTE was also performed in rested state, and the difference between the two TTE\
  \ tests (TTEdiff) determined the ability to maintain DP performance after prolonged\
  \ exercise. Vibration induced no additional effect on strength or endurance gains.\
  \ Therefore, the two strength training groups were pooled (STR, n\_=\_21). 1RM in\
  \ STR increased more than in CON (P\_<.05), and there were no differences in changes\
  \ between STR and CON in any measurements during prolonged submaximal DP. STR improved\
  \ TTE following prolonged DP (20\_\xB1\_16%, P\_<.001) and revealed a moderate effect\
  \ size compared to CON (ES\_=\_0.80; P\_=.07). Furthermore, STR improved TTEdiff\
  \ more than CON (P\_=.049). In conclusion, STR superiorly improved 1RM strength,\
  \ DP performance following prolonged submaximal DP and TTEdiff, indicating a specific\
  \ effect of improved strength on the ability to maintain performance after long-lasting\
  \ exercise."
