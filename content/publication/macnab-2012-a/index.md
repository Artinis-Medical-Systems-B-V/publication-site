abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) non-invasively detects
  changes in the concentration of the chromophores oxygenated (DeltaO(2)Hb) and deoxygenated
  hemoglobin (DeltaHHb) as the bladder detrusor muscle contracts during voiding. Such
  data provide novel information on bladder oxygenation and hemodynamics. We evaluated
  the feasibility of monitoring ambulant subjects using a wireless NIRS device. METHODS:
  The wireless device uses paired light-emitting diodes (wavelengths 760 and 850 nm)
  and a silicon photodiode detector. We monitored 14 asymptomatic subjects (10 adults,
  4 children) and 6 symptomatic children with non-neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction
  (NLUTD) during spontaneous voiding after natural filling. The device was taped to
  the abdominal skin 2 cm above the symphysis pubis across the midline. The wireless
  NIRS data (patterns of change in chromophore concentration) were compared between
  subjects and to the data obtained using a laser-powered instrument. RESULTS: Graphs
  of DeltaO(2)Hb, DeltaHHb and total hemoglobin (DeltatHb) were obtained from all
  20 patients. Data during uroflow showed reproducible patterns of bladder chromophore
  change between asymptomatic subjects (rise in DeltatHb/DeltaO (2)Hb), consistent
  with laser instrument data. In contrast, all 6 symptomatic children had a negative
  trend in DeltatHb, with falls in DeltaO(2)Hb. One adult experienced "shy" bladder
  and changes in hemodynamics/oxygenation occurred while bladder volume was unchanged.
  CONCLUSIONS: Wireless NIRS bladder monitoring is feasible in ambulant adults and
  children; wireless and laser-derived data in asymptomatic subjects are comparable.
  Pilot data suggest that subjects with symptomatic NLUTD have impaired bladder oxygenation/
  hemodynamics. The fact that chromophore changes occur when bladder volume remains
  constant supports the concept that NIRS data are a physiologic measure.'
