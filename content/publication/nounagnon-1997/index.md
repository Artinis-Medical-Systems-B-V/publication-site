abstract: "Using continuous-wave near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), this study compared\
  \ three different methods, namely the slope method (SM), the amplitude method (AM),\
  \ and the area under the curve (AUC) method to determine the variations of intramuscular\
  \ oxygenation level as a function of workload. Ten right-handed subjects (22\xB1\
  4 years) performed one isometric contraction at each of three different workloads\
  \ (30 %, 50 % and 90 % of maximal voluntary strength) during a period of twenty\
  \ seconds. Changes in oxyhemoglobin ($\u0394$[HbO2]) and deoxyhemoglobin ($\u0394\
  $[HHb]) concentrations in the superficial flexor of fingers were recorded using\
  \ continuous-wave NIRS. The results showed a strong consistency between the three\
  \ methods, with standardized Cronbach alphas of 0.87 for $\u0394$[HHb] and 0.95\
  \ for $\u0394$[HbO2]. No significant differences between the three methods were\
  \ observed concerning $\u0394$[HHb] as a function of workload. However, only the\
  \ SM showed sufficient sensitivity to detect a significant decrease in $\u0394$[HbO2]\
  \ between 30 % and 50 % of workload (p < 0.01). Among these three methods, the SM\
  \ appeared to be the only method that was well adapted and sensitive enough to determine\
  \ slight changes in $\u0394$[HbO2]. Theoretical and methodological implications\
  \ of these results are discussed."
