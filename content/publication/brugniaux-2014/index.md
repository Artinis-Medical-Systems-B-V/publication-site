abstract: "Elevated cardiorespiratory fitness improves resting cerebral perfusion,\
  \ although to what extent this is further amplified during acute exposure to exercise\
  \ stress and the corresponding implications for cerebral oxygenation remain unknown.\
  \ To examine this, we recruited 12 moderately active and 12 sedentary healthy males.\
  \ Middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv) and prefrontal cortical oxyhemoglobin\
  \ (cO 2 Hb) concentration were monitored continuously at rest and throughout an\
  \ incremental cycling test to exhaustion. Despite a subtle elevation in the maximal\
  \ oxygen uptake (active: 52\xB19 ml/kg per minute versus sedentary: 33\xB15 ml/kg\
  \ per minute, P<0.05), resting MCAv was not different between groups. However, more\
  \ marked increases in both MCAv (+28\xB113% versus +18\xB16%, P<0.05) and cO 2 Hb\
  \ (+5\xB14% versus -2\xB13%, P<0.05) were observed in the active group during the\
  \ transition from low- to moderate-intensity exercise. Collectively, these findings\
  \ indicate that the long-term benefits associated with moderate increase in physical\
  \ activity are not observed in the resting state and only become apparent when the\
  \ cerebrovasculature is challenged by acute exertional stress. This has important\
  \ clinical implications when assessing the true extent of cerebrovascular adaptation."
