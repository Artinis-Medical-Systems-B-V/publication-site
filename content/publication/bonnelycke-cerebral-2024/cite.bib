 abstract = {While existing literature covers significant detail on the physiology of human freediving, the lack of standardized protocols has hindered comparisons due to confounding variables such as exercise and depth. By accounting for these variables, direct depth-dependent impacts on cardiovascular and blood oxygen regulation can be investigated. In this study, depth-dependent effects on 1) cerebral hemodynamic and oxygenation changes, 2) arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), and 3) heart rate during breath-hold diving without confounding effects of exercise were investigated. Six freedivers (51.0 ± 12.6 years; mean ± s.d.), instrumented with continuous-wave near-infrared spectroscopy for monitoring cerebral hemodynamic and oxygenation measurements, heart rate and SpO2, performed sled-assisted breath-hold dives to 15 m and 42 m. Arterial blood gas tensions were validated through cross-sectional periodic blood sampling. Cerebral hemodynamic changes were characteristic of breath-hold diving, with changes during ascent from both depths likely driven by decreasing SpO2 due to lung expansion. While SpO2 was significantly lower following 42 m dives (t(5) = -4.183, p \textless 0.05), mean cerebral arterial-venous blood oxygen saturation remained at 74% following dives to both depths. Cerebral oxygenation during ascent from 42 m may have been maintained through increased arterial delivery. Heart rate was variable with no significant difference in minimum heart rate between both depths (t(5) = -1.017, p \textgreater 0.05). This study presents a standardized methodology, which could provide a basis for future research on human freediving physiology and uncover ways in which freedivers can reduce potential risks of the sport.},
