abstract: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a one-day sheep-rearing
  experience on motivation and anxiety levels in patients with chronic mental illness.
  The study assessed changes in oxytocin and cortisol levels and brain activity in
  the prefrontal cortex, which is known to be associated with emotion and motivation.
  The study employed a non-randomized controlled trial design, with participants receiving
  both an intervention day (sheep rearing) and a control day (usual psychiatric day
  care) in a crossover fashion. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.
  The intervention day consisted of hands-on sheep rearing activities, while the control
  day consisted of general activities available at the psychiatric day care center.
  Results showed that the sheep-raising experience had an equal effect on motivation
  and increased mean oxytocin levels. In addition, significantly more activity was
  observed in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) region of the brain compared
  to typical psychiatric daycare activities (p textless 0.032, p textless 0.043).
  Participants tended to have increased oxytocin levels after sheep rearing, and the
  activation of the DLPFC has not previously been observed in animal intervention
  studies. These are new findings in psychiatric occupational therapy that may have
  effects on social cognition and interpersonal relationships in patients with chronic
  mental illness.
