abstract: This exploratory study aimed to investigate the long-term effects of multiple
  concussions on prefrontal cortex oxygenation during a five-minute hypercapnic challenge
  using Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). 55 physically active retired contact sport
  male athletes with three or more previous concussions (mTBI) were recruited along
  with 29 physically active males with no concussions history (CTRL). Participants
  completed five minutes of seated rest prior to the five-minute hypercapnic challenge
  (20-second breath-hold, 40-second recovery breathing; five times). NIRS measured
  right and left side oxygenated (O2Hb), deoxygenated (HHb), total (tHb) haemoglobin,
  and haemoglobin difference (HbDiff) with all parameters analysed through changes
  in average maximal and minimal values (ΔMAX), Z-scores, and standard deviations.
  Right prefrontal cortex HbDiff ΔMAX was significantly higher in the mTBI compared
  to CTRL (p = 0.045) group. Left prefrontal cortex O2Hb ΔMAX (p = 0.040), HHb Z-Scores
  (p = 0.008), and HbDiff ΔMAX(p = 0.014) were significantly higher in the mTBI group.
  Within-group right vs left analyses demonstrated significantly lower left HbDiff
  ΔMAX (p = 0.048) and HbDiff Z-scores (p = 0.002) in the mTBI group, while the CTRL
  group had significantly lower left HHb Z-scores (p = 0.003) and left tHb Z-scores
  (p = 0.042). This study provides preliminary evidence that athletes with a history
  of three or more concussions may have impaired prefrontal cortex oxygenation parameters
  during a hypercapnic challenge.
