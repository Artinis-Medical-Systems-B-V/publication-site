abstract: The integration of neurophysiological techniques into Industry 5.0 represents
  a transformative approach to assessing human factors in real-world operational settings.
  This study presents a systematic review of existing literature to evaluate the application
  of neurophysiological methods in assessing cognitive and emotional states, such
  as workload, stress, attention, and trust, within industrial environments. A total
  of X peer-reviewed articles published between 2018 and 2024 were analyzed following
  a structured methodology. The findings reveal that EEG (45%), eye-tracking (30%),
  EDA (20%), and ECG (15%) are the most frequently adopted techniques for monitoring
  cognitive and emotional responses. Additionally, 60% of the studies focused on stress
  and workload assessment, while only 25% examined trust and collaboration in human–robot
  interaction, highlighting a gap in comprehensive teamwork analysis. Furthermore,
  only 35% of the studies validated their approaches in real-world industrial settings,
  emphasizing a significant limitation in ecological validity. The review also identifies
  that multimodal integration remains underexplored, with just 15% of studies combining
  multiple neurophysiological signals for a more holistic assessment. These results
  indicate a growing but still fragmented research landscape, with clear opportunities
  for expanding real-world applications, improving methodological standardization,
  and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. Future research should prioritize
  validation in dynamic, real-life work environments and explore the synergistic potential
  of multimodal neurophysiological approaches to enhance human-centred industrial
  systems.
