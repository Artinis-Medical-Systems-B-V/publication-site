abstract: "We investigated the impact of ramp and constant-load exercise on (i) respiratory\
  \ muscle fatigue and locomotor muscle oxygenation, (ii) their relationship with\
  \ the excess VO2 and VO2 slow component (SC). Fourteen male cyclists performed two\
  \ tests to exhaustion: an incremental ramp and a constant-load exercise with continuous\
  \ monitoring of expired gases and oxygenation of the vastus lateralis muscle on\
  \ two separate days. Maximal inspiratory (MIP) and expiratory (MEP) pressure measurements\
  \ were taken at rest and post- exercise. The VO2 excess represents the difference\
  \ between VO2max observed and VO2max expected using linear equation between the\
  \ VO2 and the intensity before gas-exchange threshold. During the ramp exercise,\
  \ MIP and MEP declined by 13\_\xB1\_8 and 19\_\xB1\_10%, respectively (p\_<\_0.05).\
  \ MIP and MEP were not correlated to the excess VO2 (0.09\_\xB1\_0.05\_l\_min\u2212\
  1). During the constant-load exercise, the VO2 SC (0.70\_\xB1\_0.22\_l\_min\u2212\
  1) was correlated (r\_=\_0.68, p\_<\_0.01) to deoxyhemoglobin SC (2.94\_\xB1\_1.25\_\
  A\_U) but not to the excess VO2 (r\_=\_0.30, p\_=\_0.2). Additionally, the significant\
  \ decrease in MIP (20\_\xB1\_9%) and MEP (23\_\xB1\_11%) was correlated (r\_=\_\
  0.55, p\_<\_0.05 and r\_=\_0.75, p\_<\_0.05, respectively) to the VO2 SC. Our results\
  \ show that respiratory muscle fatigue was correlated to the VO2 SC in the constant-load\
  \ exercise, whereas it was not correlated to the excess VO2 in ramp exercise may\
  \ be because of our small excess VO2."
