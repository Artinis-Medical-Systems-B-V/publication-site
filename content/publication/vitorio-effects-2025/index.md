abstract: Background Internal and external cueing strategies are often applied to
  alleviate gait deficits in Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, it remains unclear
  which type of cueing strategy is most effective at different disease stages. The
  underlying neural mechanisms of response to cueing are also unknown. Objective To
  investigate the immediate response of multiple brain cortical regions and gait to
  internal and external cueing in people at different stages of PD. Methods People
  with PD (n = 80) were split into groups dependent on their disease stage (Hoehn
  and Yahr [H&Y] stage I to III). Participants performed a baseline walk without cues
  followed by randomized cued walking conditions (internal and external [visual, auditory
  and tactile] cues). A combined functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and
  electroencephalography (EEG) system assessed cortical brain activity while walking.
  Wearable inertial sensors assessed gait. Results Cue-related gait improvements were
  not influenced by H&Y stage; moderate or large effect sizes were only observed for
  internal cueing and external visual cueing. fNIRS findings suggested cortical response
  was similar across H&Y stages, with increased activity in the prefrontal cortex
  with internal cues; and increased activity in the primary motor and visual cortices
  with external cues. However, EEG showed that people with PD in H&YIII had higher
  parietal alpha power than those in H&YI in the auditory, tactile, and visual cueing
  conditions. Conclusion Gait improvement with cueing was similar across PD stages
  and underpinned by cognitive, motor, and/or sensory neural processing within selective
  brain regions that may be influenced by PD stage (i.e., parietal cortex).
