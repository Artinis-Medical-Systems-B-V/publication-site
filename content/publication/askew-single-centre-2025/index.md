abstract: Introduction Patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) can experience
  intermittent claudication, which limits walking capacity and the ability to undertake
  daily activities. While exercise therapy is an established way to improve walking
  capacity in people with PAD, it is not feasible in all patients. Neuromuscular electrical
  stimulation (NMES) provides a way to passively induce repeated muscle contractions
  and has been widely used as a therapy for chronic conditions that limit functional
  capacity. Preliminary trials in patients with PAD demonstrate that stimulation of
  the leg muscles using a footplate-NMES device can be performed without pain and
  may lead to significant gains in walking capacity. Studies, to date, have been small
  and have not been adequately controlled to account for any potential placebo effect.
  Therefore, the current trial will compare the effect of a 12-week programme of footplate-NMES
  with a placebo-control on walking capacity (6 min walking distance) and other secondary
  outcomes in patients with Methods and analysis The Foot-PAD trial is a double-blinded,
  randomised placebo-controlled trial to determine the effect of a 12-week home-based
  programme of footplate NMES on walking capacity in people with PAD. This is a single-centre
  trial with numerous recruitment locations. A total of 180 participants with stable
  PAD and intermittent claudication will be randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive
  either footplate-NMES (intervention condition) or footplate-placebo (control condition)
  for two 30 min periods each day for 12 weeks. The footplate-NMES device will deliver
  stimulation sufficient to induce contraction of the leg muscles and repeated plantar
  and dorsiflexion at the ankles. The footplate-placebo device will deliver a momentary
  low-intensity transient stimulation that is insufficient to induce contraction of
  the leg muscles. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline (week 0), mid-intervention
  (week 6), postintervention (week 12) and 6 weeks after the completion of the intervention
  (week 18). The primary outcome is walking capacity at week 12, measured as maximum
  walking distance during the 6 min walk test. Secondary outcomes will include pain-free
  walking distance during the 6 min walk test; pain-free and maximum walking time
  during a graded treadmill walking test; disease-specific quality of life (Intermittent
  Claudication Questionnaire), self-reported walking impairment (Walking Impairment
  Questionnaire) and accelerometer-derived physical activity levels. Exploratory outcomes
  will include the Ankle-Brachial Index; leg vascular function; perception of device-use
  experience and symptom monitoring throughout the trial using the Claudication Symptom
  Instrument and a pain Visual Analogue Scale.
