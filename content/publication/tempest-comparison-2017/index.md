abstract: "The aim of this observational study was to compare head motion and prefrontal\
  \ haemodynamics during exercise using three commercial cycling ergometers. Participants\
  \ (n\_=\_12) completed an incremental exercise test to exhaustion during upright,\
  \ recumbent and semi-recumbent cycling. Head motion (using accelerometry), physiological\
  \ data (oxygen uptake, end-tidal carbon dioxide [PETCO2] and heart rate) and changes\
  \ in prefrontal haemodynamics (oxygenation, deoxygenation and blood volume using\
  \ near infrared spectroscopy [NIRS]) were recorded. Despite no difference in oxygen\
  \ uptake and heart rate, head motion was higher and PETCO2 was lower during upright\
  \ cycling at maximal exercise (P<0\u02D905). Analyses of covariance (covariates:\
  \ head motion P>0\u02D905; PETCO2, P<0\u02D901) revealed that prefrontal oxygenation\
  \ was higher during semi-recumbent than recumbent cycling and deoxygenation and\
  \ blood volume were higher during upright than recumbent and semi-recumbent cycling\
  \ (respectively; P<0\u02D905). This work highlights the robustness of the utility\
  \ of NIRS to head motion and describes the potential postural effects upon the prefrontal\
  \ haemodynamic response during upright and recumbent cycling exercise."
