abstract: "Background: Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been used to measure\
  \ oxidative capacity, but regional differences have not been identified. Piano players\
  \ are also a novel group of subjects for this lab. Methods: Controls (n = 13) and\
  \ piano players (n = 8) were tested in a seated position on the right forearm. A\
  \ fatigue test was performed for three minutes at 2, 4 and 6 Hz using electrical\
  \ stimulation, which created an endurance index (EI) as the forearm fatigued. A\
  \ six-cuff oxidative capacity test was performed using manual exercise to activate\
  \ the muscle and allow for regional specificity. A rate constant (Rc) was generated\
  \ from the mitochondrial capacity data. Results: Overall, piano players (Rc = 1.76\
  \ \xB1 0.6) and controls (Rc = 1.17 \xB1 0.3) have significant differences for the\
  \ last two fingers (p = 0.01). While controls have significant differences between\
  \ the index (Rc = 1.86 \xB1 0.5) and last two fingers (Rc = 1.17 \xB1 0.3) (p =\
  \ 0.001), this difference was not observed in piano players. Overall, piano players\
  \ (EI = 75.7 \xB1 12.3) and controls (EI = 73.0 \xB1 17.3) had no differences in\
  \ endurance index values (p = 0.71). Conclusions: Piano players have significant\
  \ differences in the mitochondrial capacity of the finger flexors that control the\
  \ last two fingers compared to controls. The lack of difference between groups in\
  \ the index fingers and overall endurance test suggests playing the piano produces\
  \ training adaptations to the finger flexor muscles of the last two digits, which\
  \ are rarely used by control subjects."
