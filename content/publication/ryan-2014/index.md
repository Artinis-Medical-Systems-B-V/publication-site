abstract: 'Introduction: Mitochondrial dysfunction in the motor neuron has been suspected
  in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). If mitochondrial abnormalities are also
  found in skeletal muscle, assessing skeletal muscle could serve as an important
  biomarker of disease progression. Methods: Using <sup>31</sup>P magnetic resonance
  (<sup>31</sup>P-MRS) and near infrared (NIRS) spectroscopy, we compared the absolute
  values and reproducibility of skeletal muscle oxidative capacity in people with
  ALS (n=6) and healthy adults (young, n=7 and age-matched, n=4). Results: ALS patients
  had slower time constants for phosphocreatine (PCr) and muscle oxygen consumption
  (mVO<inf>2</inf>) compared with young, but not age-matched controls. The coefficient
  of variation for the time constant was 10% (SD=2.8%) and 17% (SD=6.2%) for PCr and
  mVO<inf>2</inf>, respectively. Conclusions: People with ALS had, on average, a small
  but not statistically significant, impairment in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function
  measured by both <sup>31</sup>P-MRS and NIRS. Both methods demonstrated good reproducibility.'
