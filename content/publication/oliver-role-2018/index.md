abstract: Previous studies have shown right parietal activation in response to observing
  irrational actions. Behavioral studies show that people sometimes imitate irrational
  actions, a phenomenon called overimitation. However, limitations on movement in
  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) mean that the neural basis of overimitation
  has not been studied. To address this, our study employed a less restrictive neuroimaging
  technique, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Measurements were taken
  while participants observed either rational or irrational movements before performing
  movements on a computerized puzzle task. Observing irrational actions produced greater
  activation in right anterior inferior parietal lobule (aIPL), replicating results
  from the fMRI literature. This is a proof of principle that fNIRS can be used as
  an alternative to fMRI in social cognition experiments, and that parietal cortex
  has a core role in responding to irrational actions.
