abstract: "Increased oxygenated hemoglobin concentration of the prefrontal cortex\
  \ (PFC) has been observed during linear walking, particularly when there is a high\
  \ attention demand on the task, like in dual-task (DT) paradigms. Despite the knowledge\
  \ that cognitive and motor demands depend on the complexity of the motor task, most\
  \ studies have only focused on usual walking, while little is known for more challenging\
  \ tasks, such as curved paths. To explore the relationship between cortical activation\
  \ and gait biomechanics, 20 healthy young adults were asked to perform linear and\
  \ curvilinear walking trajectories in single-task and DT conditions. PFC activation\
  \ was assessed using functional near-infrared spectroscopy, while gait quality with\
  \ four inertial measurement units. The Figure-of-8-Walk-Test was adopted as the\
  \ curvilinear trajectory, with the \u201CSerial 7s\u201D test as concurrent cognitive\
  \ task. Results show that walking along curvilinear trajectories in DT led to increased\
  \ PFC activation and decreased motor performance. Under DT walking, the neural correlates\
  \ of executive function and gait control tend to be modified in response to the\
  \ cognitive resources imposed by the motor task. Being more representative of real-life\
  \ situations, this approach to curved walking has the potential to reveal crucial\
  \ information and to improve people' s balance, safety, and life's quality."
