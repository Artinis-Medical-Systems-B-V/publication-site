abstract: "Prevalence of masticatory parafunctions, such as tooth clenching and grinding,\
  \ is higher among migraineurs than non-migraineurs, and masticatory dysfunctions\
  \ may aggravate migraine. Migraine predisposes to cerebrovascular disturbances,\
  \ possibly due to impaired autonomic vasoregulation, and sensitization of the trigeminovascular\
  \ system. The relationships between clenching, migraine, and cerebral circulation\
  \ are poorly understood. We used Near-Infrared Spectroscopy to investigate bilateral\
  \ relative oxy-(%\u2206[O2 Hb]), deoxy-(%\u2206[HHb]), and total (%\u2206[tHb])\
  \ hemoglobin concentration changes in prefrontal cortex induced by maximal tooth\
  \ clenching in twelve headache-free migraineurs and fourteen control subjects. From\
  \ the start of the test, migraineurs showed a greater relative increase in right-side\
  \ %\u2206[HHb] than controls, who showed varying reactions, and right-side increase\
  \ in %\u2206[tHb] was also greater in migraineurs (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively,\
  \ time-group interactions, Linear mixed models). With multivariate regression model,\
  \ migraine predicted the magnitude of maximal blood pressure increases, associated\
  \ in migraineurs with mood scores and an intensity of both headache and painful\
  \ signs of temporomandibular disorders (pTMD). Although changes in circulatory parameters\
  \ predicted maximal NIRS responses, the between-group differences in the right-side\
  \ NIRS findings remained significant after adjusting them for systolic blood pressure\
  \ and heart rate. A family history of migraine, reported by all migraineurs and\
  \ four controls, also predicted maximal increases in both %\u2206[HHb] and %\u2206\
  [tHb]. Presence of pTMD, revealed in clinical oral examination in eight migraineurs\
  \ and eight controls, was related to maximal %\u2206[HHb] increase only in controls.\
  \ To conclude, the greater prefrontal right-side increases in cerebral %\u2206[HHb]\
  \ and %\u2206[tHb] may reflect disturbance of the tooth clenching-related cerebral\
  \ (de)oxygenation based on impaired reactivity and abnormal microcirculation processes\
  \ in migraineurs. This finding may have an impact in migraine pathophysiology and\
  \ help to explain the deleterious effect of masticatory dysfunctions in migraine\
  \ patients. However, the role of tooth clenching as a migraine trigger calls for\
  \ further studies."
