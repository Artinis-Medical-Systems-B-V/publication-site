abstract: "New Findings: What is the central question of this study? What are the\
  \ mechanisms responsible for the decline in cognitive performance following exposure\
  \ to acute normobaric hypoxia? What are the main findings and their importance?\
  \ We found that (1) performance of a complex central executive task (n-back) was\
  \ reduced at FIO2 0.12; (2) there was a strong correlation between performance of\
  \ the n-back task and reductions in SpO2 and cerebral oxygenation; and (3) plasma\
  \ adrenaline, noradrenaline, cortisol and copeptin were not correlated with cognitive\
  \ performance. Abstract: It is well established that hypoxia impairs cognitive function;\
  \ however, the physiological mechanisms responsible for these effects have received\
  \ relatively little attention. This study examined the effects of graded reductions\
  \ in fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) on oxygen saturation (SpO2), cerebral oxygenation,\
  \ cardiorespiratory variables, activity of the sympathoadrenal system (adrenaline,\
  \ noradrenaline) and hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis (cortisol, copeptin),\
  \ and cognitive performance. Twelve healthy males [mean (SD), age: 22 (4)\_years,\
  \ height: 178 (5) cm, mass: 75 (9) kg, FEV1/FVC ratio: 85 (5)%] completed a four-task\
  \ battery of cognitive tests to examine inhibition, selective attention (Eriksen\
  \ flanker), executive function (n-back) and simple and choice reaction time (Deary\u2013\
  Liewald). Tests were completed before and following 60\_min of exposure to (Formula\
  \ presented.) 0.2093, 0.17, 0.145 and 0.12. Following 60\_min of exposure, response\
  \ accuracy in the n-back task was significantly reduced in FIO2 0.12 compared to\
  \ baseline [82 (9) vs. 93 (5)%; P\_<\_0.001] and compared to all other conditions\
  \ at the same time point [FIO2 0.2093: 92 (3)%; (Formula presented.) 0.17: 91 (6)%;\
  \ FIO2 0.145: 85 (10)%; (Formula presented.) 12: 82 (9)%; all P\_<\_0.05]. The performance\
  \ of the other tasks was maintained. $\u0394$accuracy and $\u0394$reaction time\
  \ of the n-back task was correlated with both $\u0394$SpO2 [r(9)\_=\_0.66, P\_<\_\
  0.001 and r(9)\_=\_\u22120.36, P\_=\_0.037, respectively] and $\u0394$cerebral oxygenation\
  \ [r(7)\_=\_0.55, P\_<\_0.001 and r(7)\_=\_\u22120.38, P\_=\_0.045, respectively].\
  \ Plasma adrenaline, noradrenaline, cortisol and copeptin were not significantly\
  \ elevated in any condition or correlated with any of the tests of cognitive performance.\
  \ These findings suggest that reductions in peripheral oxygen saturation and cerebral\
  \ oxygenation, and not increased activity of the sympathoadrenal system and hypothalamic\u2013\
  pituitary\u2013adrenal axis, as previously speculated, are responsible for a decrease\
  \ in cognitive performance during normobaric hypoxia."
