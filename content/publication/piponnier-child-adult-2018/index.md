abstract: "The aim of the present study was t.compare the development and etiology\
  \ of neuromuscular fatigue of the knee extensor (KE) and plantar flexor (PF) muscles\
  \ during repeated maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVICs) between children\
  \ and adults. Prepubertal boys (n = 21; 9-11 yr) and men (n = 24; 18-30 yr) performed\
  \ two fatigue protocols consisting of a repetition of 5-s isometric MVIC of the\
  \ KE or PF muscles interspersed with 5-s passive recovery periods until MVIC reached\
  \ 60% of its initial value. The etiology of neuromuscular fatigue of the KE and\
  \ PF muscles was investigated by means of noninvasive methods, such as the surface\
  \ electromyography, single and doublet magnetic stimulation, twitch interpolation\
  \ technique, and near-infrared spectroscopy. The number of repetitions performed\
  \ was significantly lower in men (15.4 \xB1 3.8) than boys (38.7 \xB1 18.8) for\
  \ the KE fatigue test. In contrast, no significant difference was found for the\
  \ PF muscles between boys and men (12.1 \xB1 4.9 and 13.8 \xB1 4.9 repetitions,\
  \ respectively). Boys displayed a lower reduction in potentiated twitch torque,\
  \ low-frequency fatigue, and muscle oxygenation than men whatever the muscle group\
  \ considered. In contrast, voluntary activation level and normalized electromyography\
  \ data decreased to a greater extent in boys than men for both muscle groups. To\
  \ conclude, boys experienced less peripheral and more central fatigue during repeated\
  \ MVICs than men whatever the muscle group considered. However, child-adult differences\
  \ in neuromuscular fatigue were muscle-dependent since boys fatigued similarly to\
  \ men with the PF muscles and to a lower extent with the KE muscles. NEW & NOTEWORTHY\
  \ Child-adult differences in neuromuscular fatigue during repeated maximal voluntary\
  \ contractions are specific to the muscle group since children fatigue similarly\
  \ to adults with the plantar flexor muscles and to a lower extent with the knee\
  \ extensor muscles. Children experience less peripheral fatigue and more central\
  \ fatigue than adults, regardless of the muscle group considered."
