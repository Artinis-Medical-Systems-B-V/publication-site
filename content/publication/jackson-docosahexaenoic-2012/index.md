abstract: "A number of recent studies have assessed the impact of dietary omega-3\
  \ polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) on behavioral outcomes; however, very\
  \ little attention has been given to their impact upon brain function in physiological\
  \ terms. Sixty-five healthy adults aged 18-29. yrs took part in this double-blind,\
  \ placebo-controlled study assessing the effects of 12 weeks daily dietary supplementation\
  \ with docosahexaenoic acid-rich fish oil (1. g, 2. g) or placebo (olive oil). Relative\
  \ changes in the concentration of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin were assessed\
  \ in the prefrontal cortex using near-infrared spectroscopy during performance of\
  \ nine computerized cognitive tasks. Supplementation with both doses of fish oil,\
  \ in comparison with placebo, resulted in significantly increased concentrations\
  \ of oxyhemoglobin and total levels of hemoglobin, indicative of increased cerebral\
  \ blood flow, during the cognitive tasks. Changes in hemodynamic response to tasks\
  \ were not accompanied by consistent changes in cognitive performance. \xA9 2011\
