abstract: Studies examining dual-task gait (DTG) have used varying conditions such
  as overground or treadmill walking, however it is not known whether brain activation
  patterns differ during these conditions. Therefore, this study compared oxyhaemoglobin
  (O2Hb) responses of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during overground and treadmill
  walking. A total of 30 participants (14M/16F) were recruited in a randomized crossover
  study comparing overground and treadmill walking under single- and dual-task (STG
  and DTG) conditions. The DTG consisted of performing walking and cognitive (serial
  subtraction by 7â€²s) tasks concurrently. A portable 24-channel functional near-infrared
  spectroscopy system was placed over the PFC, corresponding the left and right dorsolateral
  PFC and frontopolar cortices (DLPFC and FPC) during overground and treadmill STG
  and DTG. Results showed a reduction in gait speed during DTG compared to STG on
  overground but not treadmill walking, while cognitive performance was maintained
  during DTG on both overground and treadmill walking. A reduction in O2Hb was seen
  in the FPC during DTG compared to a cognitive task only, and on the treadmill compared
  to overground walking. Increased activation was seen in the left and right DLPFC
  during DTG but did not differ between treadmill and overground walking. Our results
  support the concept of improved gait efficiency during treadmill walking, indicated
  by the lack of change in STG and DTG performance and concomitant with a reduction
  in FPC activation. These findings suggest different neural strategies underpinning
  treadmill and overground walking, which should be considered when designing gait
  assessment and rehabilitation interventions.
