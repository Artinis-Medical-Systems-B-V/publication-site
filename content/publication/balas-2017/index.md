abstract: "The use of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to investigate muscle oxygenation\
  \ changes during physical tasks such as rock climbing has rapidly increased within\
  \ recent years; yet, there is no known measure of reliability. The current study\
  \ aimed to determine intersession reliability and minimal detectable change (MDC)\
  \ of continuous wave NIRS parameters during intermittent handgrip contractions in\
  \ rock climbers. Thirty-two sport climbers were tested for exhaustive intermittent\
  \ handgrip exercise (8-second contraction\u20132-second relief) at 60% of maximal\
  \ voluntary contraction on 3 separate days. During each visit, continuous wave NIRS\
  \ was used to determine tissue saturation index (TSI) as the measure of tissue oxygenation\
  \ in the flexor digitorum profundus. To assess the intersession reliability, the\
  \ intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), SEM, coefficient of variation (CV),\
  \ and MDC were used. Mean deoxygenation during the contractions provided reliable\
  \ results ($\u0394$ TSI; first trial 28.9 6 2.9%, second trial 28.8 6 2.7%, and\
  \ third trial 28.4 6 2.6%; ICC = 0.692; SEM = 1.5%; CV = 17.2%; MDC = 4.2%). Mean\
  \ muscle reoxygenation during the relief periods was similarly reliable ($\u0394\
  $ TSI; first trial 9.0 6 3.1%, second trial 8.8 6 2.9%, and third trial 8.5 6 2.7%;\
  \ ICC = 0.672; SEM = 1.7%; CV = 19.0%, MDC = 4.7%). As such, continuous wave NIRS\
  \ provides a reliable measure of deoxygenation and reoxygenation during intermittent\
  \ contractions to failure in the forearm flexors of rock climbers. Differences exceeding;4.5%\
  \ for $\u0394$ TSI during contraction and relief periods should be considered meaningful."
