abstract: Background This study investigated the long-term effects of multiple concussions
  on prefrontal cortex oxygenation using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during
  a squat-stand maneuver that activated dynamic cerebral autoregulation.  Methods
  Active male retired contact sport athletes with a history of 3+ concussions (mTBI;
  n = 55), and active retired athletes with no concussion history (CTRL; n = 29) were
  recruited. Participants completed a 5-min squat-stand maneuve (10-s squat, 10-s
  stand, 0.05 Hz; 15 times). Oxygenated (O2Hb), deoxygenated (HHb), total (tHb) hemoglobin,
  and hemoglobin difference (HbDiff) were analyzed through the change in maximal and
  minimal values during the test (∆MAX), Z-scores, and standard deviations.  Results
  mTBI group showed left prefrontal cortex O2Hb ∆MAX (p = 0.046) and HbDiff ∆MAX (p
  = 0.018) were significantly higher. Within-group analyses showed significantly higher
  left HHb ∆MAX (p = 0.003) and lower left HbDiff Z-scores (p = 0.010) only in the
  mTBI group. The CTRL group demonstrated significantly lower left HbDiff SD (p =
  0.039), tHb Z-scores (p = 0.030), and HbDiff ∆MAX (p = 0.037) compared to right
  prefrontal cortex response.  Conclusion These preliminary results suggest changes
  in prefrontal cortex oxygenation potentially affecting the brain’s ability to adapt
  to changing cerebral perfusion pressure after multiple previous concussions.
