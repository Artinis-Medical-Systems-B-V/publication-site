abstract: "Objective To describe the use of a novel neuromuscular electrical stimulation\
  \ (NMES) endurance exercise protocol and its effects on skeletal muscle oxidative\
  \ capacity. Design Case report, pre/post intervention. Setting University-based\
  \ trial. Participant A 39-year-old man who suffered a motor complete spinal cord\
  \ injury (C5-6, ASIA Impairment Scale grade A). Intervention Twenty-four weeks of\
  \ endurance NMES that consisted of progressive increases in the twitch frequency,\
  \ duration of sessions, and sessions per week. Main Outcome Measure Mitochondrial\
  \ capacity was measured, in vivo, as the rate of recovery of muscle oxygen consumption\
  \ using near-infrared spectroscopy. Results The rate of recovery of muscle oxygen\
  \ consumption increased approximately 3-fold from 0.52 to 1.43, 1.46, and 1.40/min\
  \ measured on 3 separate occasions during week 12 of training, and 1.57/min after\
  \ 24 weeks of NMES endurance training. Conclusion The findings of this study suggest\
  \ that NMES endurance training using twitches can increase mitochondrial capacity\
  \ to comparable levels measured in nonparalyzed muscles of sedentary able-bodied\
  \ controls. \xA9 2013 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine."
