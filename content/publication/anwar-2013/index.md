abstract: "Brain activity can be measured using different modalities. Since most of\
  \ the modalities tend to complement each other, it seems promising to measure them\
  \ simultaneously. In to be presented research, the data recorded from Functional\
  \ Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS), simultaneously,\
  \ are subjected to causality analysis using time-resolved partial directed coherence\
  \ (tPDC). Time-resolved partial directed coherence uses the principle of state space\
  \ modelling to estimate Multivariate Autoregressive (MVAR) coefficients. This method\
  \ is useful to visualize both frequency and time dynamics of causality between the\
  \ time series. Afterwards, causality results from different modalities are compared\
  \ by estimating the Spearman correlation. In to be presented study, we used directionality\
  \ vectors to analyze correlation, rather than actual signal vectors. Results show\
  \ that causality analysis of the fMRI correlates more closely to causality results\
  \ of oxy-NIRS as compared to deoxy-NIRS in case of a finger sequencing task. However,\
  \ in case of simple finger tapping, no clear difference between oxy-fMRI and deoxy-fMRI\
  \ correlation is identified. \xA9 2013 IEEE."
