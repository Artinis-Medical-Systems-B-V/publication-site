abstract: "Background and Purpose: Gait and turning impairments are common in people\
  \ with Parkinson disease (PwPD). Tactile cues delivered in open- or closed-loop\
  \ modalities may improve gait and turning in PwPD, but underlying mechanisms are\
  \ unclear. Attention stemming from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) may play a role in\
  \ cue response, but PFC contributions to specific cue modalities are unclear. Examining\
  \ how open- and closed-loop cueing influences PFC activity during walking and turning\
  \ in PwPD may elucidate mechanisms involved in cue response, which could advance\
  \ development of effective therapeutics. We examined PFC activity during walking\
  \ and turning in response to open- and closed-loop cueing in PwPD, and explored\
  \ relationships between PFC activity and behavioral measures. Methods: A mobile\
  \ functional near-infrared spectroscopy device measured PFC activity during walking\
  \ and turning in 25 PwPD (n = 13 freezers, n = 12 nonfreezers). Participants performed\
  \ 180\xB0 and 360\xB0 turns while walking, and a 2-minute walk under single- and\
  \ dual-task (AX-CPT) conditions with and without an open- (metronome-like vibration)\
  \ or closed-loop (biofeedback vibration) tactile cue. Results: PFC activity did\
  \ not change when walking or turning in PwPD; freezing status or task demands did\
  \ not influence PFC activity. With both open- and closed-loop cueing dual-task cost\
  \ of gait significantly improved, whereas turning slowed. Discussion and Conclusions:\
  \ Our preliminary results indicate that both open- and closed-loop cueing can improve\
  \ gait without additional burden to the PFC beyond usual walking. However, turning\
  \ while walking slowed with cueing with no PFC activity change. Further investigations\
  \ are necessary to establish these findings in a larger cohort. Video Abstract available\
  \ for more insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, the Video,\
