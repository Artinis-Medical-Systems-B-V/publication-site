abstract: "PURPOSE: Evaluation of skeletal muscle oxidative capacity in people with\
  \ multiple sclerosis (MS) using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and its relationship\
  \ with measures of walking disability. METHODS: Muscle oxidative capacity was measured\
  \ in an MS and control (CON) group with near- infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during\
  \ repeated arterial occlusions to assess rate of recovery of muscle oxygen consumption\
  \ in both gastrocnemius muscles after exercise. Walking disability was assessed\
  \ by a timed 25-ft walk and fatigue questionnaires. RESULTS: Oxidative capacity\
  \ on average was lower in the MS group compared to CON group (1.13 \xB1 0.29 vs.\
  \ 1.68 \xB1 0.37 min-1, p < 0.05). 25-ft walk time was slower in patients with MS\
  \ compared to CON group (3.72 \xB1 0.40 vs. 8.50 \xB1 6.23 sec, p < 0.05). The participants\
  \ with MS who used an assistive device during the 25-ft walk test walked significantly\
  \ slower than those who used no assistive device (p < 0.01). Significant correlations\
  \ were found between oxidative capacity in the self-reported most-affected leg and\
  \ percent difference between oxidative capacity of the self-reported most-affected\
  \ and least-affected legs and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale questionnaire total\
  \ and physical score. CONCLUSION: NIRS measurements of oxidative capacity suggest\
  \ a 40% deficit in people with MS compared to healthy controls, consistent with\
  \ previous studies using 31P MRS. Preliminary evidence suggest the magnitude of\
  \ bilateral oxidative capacity deficits may be a bimodal indicator of walking dysfunction."
