abstract: 'In order to identify peripheral biomarkers of impaired oxidative metabolism
  during exercise following a 10-day bed rest, 10 males performed an incremental exercise
  (to determine peak pulmonary V̇O2 (V̇O2 p)) and moderate-intensity exercises, before
  (PRE) and after (POST) bed rest. Blood flow response was evaluated in the common
  femoral artery by Eco-Doppler during 1 min of passive leg movements (PLM). The intramuscular
  matching between O2 delivery and O2 utilization was evaluated by near-infrared spectroscopy
  (NIRS). Mitochondrial respiration was evaluated ex vivo by high-resolution respirometry
  in isolated muscle fibres, and in vivo by NIRS by the evaluation of skeletal muscle
  V̇O2 (V̇O2 m) recovery kinetics. Resting V̇O2 m was estimated by NIRS. Peak V̇O2
  p was lower in POST vs. PRE. The area under the blood flow vs. time curve during
  PLM was smaller (P = 0.03) in POST (274 ± 233 mL) vs. PRE (427 ± 291). An increased
  (P = 0.03) overshoot of muscle deoxygenation during a metabolic transition was identified
  in POST. Skeletal muscle citrate synthase activity was not different (P = 0.11)
  in POST (131 ± 16 nmol min-1 mg-1 ) vs. PRE (138 ± 19). Maximal ADP-stimulated mitochondrial
  respiration (66 ± 18 pmol s-1 mg-1 (POST) vs. 72 ± 14 (PRE), P = 0.41) was not affected
  by bed rest. Apparent Km for ADP sensitivity of mitochondrial respiration was reduced
  in POST vs. PRE (P = 0.04). The V̇O2 m recovery time constant was not different
  (P = 0.79) in POST (22 ± 6 s) vs. PRE (22 ± 6). Resting V̇O2 m was reduced by 25%
  in POST vs. PRE (P = 0.006). Microvascular-endothelial function was impaired following
  a 10-day bed rest, whereas mitochondrial mass and function (both in vivo and ex
  vivo) were unaffected or slightly enhanced. KEY POINTS: Ten days of horizontal bed
  rest impaired in vivo oxidative function during exercise. Microvascular impairments
  were identified by different methods. Mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial function
  (evaluated both in vivo and ex vivo) were unchanged or even improved (i.e. enhanced
  mitochondrial sensitivity to submaximal [ADP]). Resting muscle oxygen uptake was
  significantly lower following bed rest, suggesting that muscle catabolic processes
  induced by bed rest/inactivity are less energy-consuming than anabolic ones.'
