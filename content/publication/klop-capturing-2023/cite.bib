Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is highly prevalent in older adults and associated with dizziness, falls, lower physical and cognitive function, cardiovascular disease, and mortality. OH is currently diagnosed in a clinical setting with single-time point cuff measurements. Continuous blood pressure (BP) devices can measure OH dynamics but cannot be used for daily life monitoring. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has potential diagnostic value in measuring cerebral oxygenation continuously over a longer time period, but this needs further validation. This study aimed to compare NIRS-measured (cerebral) oxygenation with continuous BP and transcranial Doppler-measured cerebral blood velocity (CBv) during postural changes. This cross-sectional study included 41 participants between 20 and 88 years old. BP, CBv, and cerebral (long channels) and superficial (short channels) oxygenated hemoglobin (O
2
Hb) were measured continuously during various postural changes. Pearson correlations between BP, CBv, and O
2
Hb were calculated over curves and specific characteristics (maximum drop amplitude and recovery). BP and O
2
Hb only showed good curve-based correlations (0.58–0.75) in the initial 30 s after standing up. Early (30–40 s) and 1-min BP recovery associated significantly with O
2
Hb, but no consistent associations were found for maximum drop amplitude and late (60–175 s) recovery values. Associations between CBv and O
2
Hb were poor, but stronger for long-channel than short-channel measurements. BP associated well with NIRS-measured O
2
Hb in the first 30 s after postural change. Stronger associations for CBv with long-channel O
2
Hb suggest that long-channel NIRS specifically reflects cerebral blood flow during postural transitions, necessary to better understand the consequences of OH such as intolerance symptoms.},
