abstract: Abstract  Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is highly prevalent in older adults
  and associated with dizziness, falls, lower physical and cognitive function, cardiovascular
  disease, and mortality. OH is currently diagnosed in a clinical setting with single-time
  point cuff measurements. Continuous blood pressure (BP) devices can measure OH dynamics
  but cannot be used for daily life monitoring. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)
  has potential diagnostic value in measuring cerebral oxygenation continuously over
  a longer time period, but this needs further validation. This study aimed to compare
  NIRS-measured (cerebral) oxygenation with continuous BP and transcranial Doppler-measured
  cerebral blood velocity (CBv) during postural changes. This cross-sectional study
  included 41 participants between 20 and 88 years old. BP, CBv, and cerebral (long
  channels) and superficial (short channels) oxygenated hemoglobin (O 2 Hb) were measured
  continuously during various postural changes. Pearson correlations between BP, CBv,
  and O 2 Hb were calculated over curves and specific characteristics (maximum drop
  amplitude and recovery). BP and O 2 Hb only showed good curve-based correlations
  (0.58–0.75) in the initial 30 s after standing up. Early (30–40 s) and 1-min BP
  recovery associated significantly with O 2 Hb, but no consistent associations were
  found for maximum drop amplitude and late (60–175 s) recovery values. Associations
  between CBv and O 2 Hb were poor, but stronger for long-channel than short-channel
  measurements. BP associated well with NIRS-measured O 2 Hb in the first 30 s after
  postural change. Stronger associations for CBv with long-channel O 2 Hb suggest
  that long-channel NIRS specifically reflects cerebral blood flow during postural
  transitions, necessary to better understand the consequences of OH such as intolerance
  symptoms.
