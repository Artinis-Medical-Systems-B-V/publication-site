abstract: "This investigation elucidated the underlying mechanisms of functional impairments\
  \ in patients with heart failure (HF) by simultaneously comparing cardiaccerebral-\
  \ muscle hemodynamic and ventilatory responses to exercise among HF patients with\
  \ various functional capacities. One hundred one patients with HF [New York Heart\
  \ Association HF functional class II (HF-II, n = 53) and functional class III (HF-III,\
  \ n = 48) patients] and 71 normal subjects [older control (O-C, n = 39) and younger\
  \ control (Y-C, n = 32) adults] performed an incremental exercise test using a bicycle\
  \ ergometer. A recently developed noninvasive bioreactance device was adopted to\
  \ measure cardiac hemodynamics, and near-infrared spectroscopy was employed to assess\
  \ perfusions in the frontal cerebral lobe ($\u0394$[THb] FC) and vastus lateralis\
  \ muscle ($\u0394$ [THb] VL). The results demonstrated that the Y-C group had higher\
  \ levels of cardiac output, $\u0394$ [THb] FC, and $\u0394$ [THb] VL during exercise\
  \ than the O-C group. Moreover, these cardiac/peripheral hemodynamic responses to\
  \ exercise in HF-III group were smaller than those in both HF-II and O-C groups.\
  \ Although the change of cardiac output caused by exercise was normalized, the amounts\
  \ of blood distributed to frontal cerebral lobe and vastus lateralis muscle in the\
  \ HF-III group significantly declined during exercise. The HF-III patients had lower\
  \ oxygen-uptake efficiency slopes (OUES) and greater V E-VO 2 slopes than the HF-II\
  \ patients and age-matched controls. However, neither hemodynamic nor ventilatory\
  \ response to exercise differed significantly between the HF-II and O-C groups.\
  \ Cardiac output, $\u0394$ [THb] FC, and $\u0394$ [THb] VL during exercise were\
  \ directly related to the OUES and VO 2peak and inversely related to the V E-VCO\
  \ 2 slope. Moreover, cardiac output or $\u0394$ [THb] FC was an effect modifier,\
  \ which modulated the correlation status between $\u0394$ [THb]VL and V E-VCO 2\
  \ slope. We concluded that the suppression of cerebral/muscle hemodynamics during\
  \ exercise is associated with ventilatory abnormality, which reduces functional\
  \ capacity in patients with HF. \xA9 2011 the American Physiological Society."
