abstract: 'We utilized non-invasive methods and novel computational approaches to
  examine the effects of acutely varying fractional inspired O2 (FIO2) on convective
  and diffusive steps of O2 transport and muscle tissue (de)oxygenation during incremental
  cycling to exhaustion in 10 Tier 3 and 4 endurance athletes breathing either 0.152,
  0.209, or 0.298 FIO2. At submaximal work rates (100-275 W) in hypoxia, higher cardiac
  output compensated for lower arterial O2 content. At maximal work rate, convective
  O2 transport was lower in hypoxia (mean [95%CI]: 5.37 [5.14-5.59] L/min, q textless
  0.0001) and higher in hyperoxia (6.84 [6.50-7.18] L/min, q = 0.043) compared to
  normoxia (6.56 [6.16-6.95] L/min), whereas O2 diffusive conductance did not differ
  between conditions (94 [82-106], 98 [83-112], 98[87-109] mL/min/mmHg for hypoxia,
  normoxia and hyperoxia, respectively, p = 0.490). Consequently, maximal O2 uptake
  (V̇O2max) was lower in hypoxia (4.06 [3.85-4.27] L/min, q textless 0.0001) and higher
  in hyperoxia (5.02 [4.85-5.19] L/min, q = 0.003) compared to normoxia (4.83 [4.63-5.02]
  L/min). In hypoxia, muscle tissue saturation index was 1%-4%-units lower compared
  to normoxia and hyperoxia during submaximal cycling but similar at maximal work
  rate. In summary, central and peripheral compensatory mechanisms maintained O2 uptake
  despite altered FIO2 at submaximal work rates. At maximal work rate the effects
  of hypoxia and hyperoxia on V̇O2max were mediated through convective O2 transport.'
