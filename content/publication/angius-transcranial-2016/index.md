abstract: "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can increase cortical excitability\
  \ of a targeted brain area, which may affect endurance exercise performance. However,\
  \ optimal electrode placement for tDCS remains unclear. We tested the effect of\
  \ two different tDCS electrode montages for improving exercise performance. Nine\
  \ subjects underwent a control (CON), placebo (SHAM) and two different tDCS montage\
  \ sessions in a randomized design. In one tDCS session, the anodal electrode was\
  \ placed over the left motor cortex and the cathodal on contralateral forehead (HEAD),\
  \ while for the other montage the anodal electrode was placed over the left motor\
  \ cortex and cathodal electrode above the shoulder (SHOULDER). tDCS was delivered\
  \ for 10\_min at 2.0\_mA, after which participants performed an isometric time to\
  \ exhaustion (TTE) test of the right knee extensors. Peripheral and central neuromuscular\
  \ parameters were assessed at baseline, after tDCS application and after TTE. Heart\
  \ rate (HR), ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), and leg muscle exercise-induced\
  \ muscle pain (PAIN) were monitored during the TTE. TTE was longer and RPE lower\
  \ in the SHOULDER condition (P\_<\_0.05). Central and peripheral parameters, and\
  \ HR and PAIN did not present any differences between conditions after tDCS stimulation\
  \ (P\_>\_0.05). In all conditions maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) significantly\
  \ decreased after the TTE (P\_<\_0.05) while motor-evoked potential area (MEP) increased\
  \ after TTE (P\_<\_0.05). These findings demonstrate that SHOULDER montage is more\
  \ effective than HEAD montage to improve endurance performance, likely through avoiding\
  \ the negative effects of the cathode on excitability."
