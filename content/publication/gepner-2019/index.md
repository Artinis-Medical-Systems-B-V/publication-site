abstract: "The aim of this study was to compare muscle oxygenation of the vastus lateralis\
  \ during a high-volume isokinetic resistance exercise protocol (HVP) between young\
  \ adult (YA) and middle-aged adult (MA) men. Twenty recreationally trained men were\
  \ assigned to either the YA (age 21.8\xB12.0 years, body mass 90.7\xB111.6 kg, body\
  \ height 179\xB14.7 cm) or MA (age 47.0\xB14.4 years, body mass 96.1\xB121.6 kg,\
  \ body height 177\xB17.7 cm) group. The HVP consisted of eight sets of 10 repetitions\
  \ of unilateral isokinetic concentric knee extension and eccentric knee flexion\
  \ at 60\xB0\u02D9s-1. Changes in tissue hemoglobin saturation index (TSI), tissue\
  \ oxygenated hemoglobin concentration (O2Hb), deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb), and\
  \ muscle oxidation index (O2Hb-HHb) were measured during the exercise session using\
  \ the near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Data were analyzed using two-way mix factorial\
  \ analyses of variance. Prior to exercise, TSI was significantly greater (p=.024)\
  \ for YA compared to MA. Significant decreases in O2Hb and O2Hb-HHb and increases\
  \ in HHb were observed during each of the eight sets relative to the rest periods\
  \ (p<.05) for both groups. The average change during the eight sets of the HVP revealed\
  \ a significantly higher (p=.036) level of HHb and a lower (p=.029) level of O2Hb-HHb\
  \ for MA compared to YA. A significant negative correlation was also noted at baseline\
  \ between O2Hb-HHb index and the cross-sectional area of the vastus lateralis muscle\
  \ (r=-.45, p=.045). During a highvolume resistance exercise, MA experienced reduced\
  \ muscle oxygen saturation levels compared to YA. These results may be attributed\
  \ to reductions in local tissue oxidative capacity and reduced blood delivery occurring\
  \ during middle-age, and possibly due to group differences in muscle morphology."
