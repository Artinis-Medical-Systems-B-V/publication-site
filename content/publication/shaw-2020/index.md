abstract: "Dark chocolate (DC) is high in flavonoids and has been shown to increase\
  \ nitric oxide in the blood. Increased nitric oxide has the potential to improve\
  \ delivery of oxygen to muscle, especially in hypoxic conditions, such as altitude.\
  \ Our aim was to assess the impact of DC supplementation on cycling performance\
  \ at altitude. Twelve healthy, trained cyclists (n = 2 females, n = 10 males; age\
  \ = 35 [12] years; height = 177 [7] cm; mass = 75.2 [11.0] kg; VO2max = 55 [6] ml\u02D9\
  kg\u22121\u02D9min\u22121) were randomized to supplement with 60 g of DC or placebo\
  \ twice per day for 14 days in a double-blind crossover study. After the 2 weeks\
  \ of supplementation, the participants attended a laboratory session in which they\
  \ consumed 120 g of DC or placebo and then cycled for 90 min at 50% peak power output,\
  \ followed immediately by a 10-km time trial (TT) at simulated altitude (15% O2).\
  \ The plasma concentration of blood glucose and lactate were measured before and\
  \ at 15, 30, 60, and 90 min during the steady-state exercise and post TT, while\
  \ muscular and prefrontal cortex oxygenation was measured continuously throughout\
  \ exercise using near-infrared spectroscopy. DC resulted in a higher concentration\
  \ of blood glucose (5.5 [0.5] vs. 5.3 [0.9] mmol/L) throughout the trial and lower\
  \ blood lactate concentration following the TT (7.7 [1.92] vs. 10.0 [4.6] mmol/L)\
  \ compared with the placebo. DC had no effect on the TT performance (19.04 [2.16]\
  \ vs. 19.21 \xB1 1.96 min) or oxygenation status in either the prefrontal cortex\
  \ or muscle. The authors conclude that, although it provided some metabolic benefit,\
  \ DC is not effective as an ergogenic aid during TT cycling at simulated altitude."
