abstract: The relationship between the variations in ovarian hormones (i.e., estrogens
  and progesterone) and the hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) remains unclear. HVR
  is a key adaptive mechanism to high altitude and has been proposed as a predictor
  for acute mountain sickness (AMS). This study aimed to explore the effects of hormonal
  changes across the menstrual cycle on HVR. Additionally, it assessed the predictive
  capacity of HVR for AMS and examined whether a particular menstrual phase could
  enhance its predictive accuracy. Thirteen eumenorrheic women performed a pure nitrogen
  breathing test near sea level, measuring HVR and cerebral oxygenation in early follicular,
  late follicular, and mid-luteal phases. Oxidative stress and ovarian hormone levels
  were also measured. AMS symptoms were evaluated after spending 14 h, including one
  overnight, at an altitude of 3,375 m. No differences in HVR, ventilation, peripheral
  oxygen saturation, or cerebral oxygenation were observed between the three menstrual
  cycle phases. Moreover, these parameters and the oxidative stress markers did not
  differ between the women with or without AMS (31% vs 69%), regardless of the menstrual
  cycle phase. In conclusion, ventilatory responses and cerebral oxygenation in normobaric
  hypoxia were consistent across the menstrual cycle. Furthermore, these parameters
  did not differentiate women with or without AMS.
