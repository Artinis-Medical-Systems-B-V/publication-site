abstract: "Radiographic cerebral vasospasm (CVS) after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)\
  \ do not reflect cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation and may occur in the absence\
  \ of clinical deficit and vice-versa. This report is to describe preliminary findings\
  \ in further development of a non invasive method to estimate regional cerebral\
  \ oxygenation and perfusion. Measurements were performed with a technique combining\
  \ near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and indocyaningreen (ICG) dye dilution. Successful\
  \ data analysis has been performed based on the decomposition in pulsatile and non-pulsatile\
  \ components of NIRS absorption data collected before and during the passage of\
  \ ICG through the vascular bed under the NIRS-detector. First measurements in patients\
  \ with CVS suggest that the technique could become a powerful tool in the detection\
  \ and treatment of CVS. This non invasive technique can be done at the bedside,\
  \ it seems to be safe, easy to perform and less time-consuming compared to conventional\
  \ techniques. The influence of extracerebral bone and surface tissue on cerebral\
  \ NIRS signal has not been clarified yet. Therefore a new subdural NIRS probe has\
  \ been developed, which gives the opportunity to measure directly the concentration\
  \ of the chromophores in the brain without the influence of extracerebral contamination.\
  \ In future comparative measurements with conventional NIRS probes on the scalp\
  \ will allow to quantify and eliminate extracerebral contamination from the NIRS\
  \ signal. \xA9 Springer-Verlag 2002."
