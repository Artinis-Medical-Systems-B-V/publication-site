abstract: 'Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been used to measure reactive hyperemia
  following a vascular occlusion. However, the procedures and methods of analysis
  used have varied. The purpose of the present study is to identify reproducible methods
  for measuring reactive hyperemia using HbO2 NIRS signals in the calf and foot. Healthy
  participants (10 male, 10 female) aged 19 to 28 years performed one of two tests:
  reproducibility trials or elevation protocol (30 and 60 cm limb elevation above
  the heart). The time to 50% reperfusion (T1/2) and the second (R2q) quartile rates
  of reperfusion were found to be the most reproducible parameters (coefficient of
  variation= 7.12 to 14.1%). The time to 95% reperfusion (T95) was 12.7% more reproducible
  on average than the previously reported parameter of time to peak hyperemia. Measures
  of reperfusion time and rate slowed with increasing limb elevation. Correlations
  were identified between the calf and foot in the measurements of R2q (R2 = 0.713,
  p = 0.021), T1/2 (R2 = 0.673, p = 0.033), and T95 (R2 = 0.792, p = 0.006). Half
  and 95% recovery times and second and third quartile rates expressed good reproducibility
  and sensitivity to change with reduced perfusion pressure. NIRS measures of reactive
  hyperemia have the potential to evaluate microvascular perfusion in clinical populations.'
