abstract: Pre-term birth elicits long-lasting physiological effects in various organ
  systems, potentially modulating exercise- and environmental-stress responses. To
  establish whether adult survivors of pre-term birth respond uniquely to sub-acute
  high-altitude exposure at rest and during exercise, 17 prematurely-born healthy
  adults (gestational age textless 32 weeks) and 17 term-born, age- and aerobic-capacity-matched,
  control participants completed a three-day high-altitude sojourn (3375 m). Whole-body
  oxygen uptake, pulmonary ventilation and haemodynamic responses, as well as pulse
  oxygen saturation, brain tissue saturation index (TSI) and skeletal muscle TSI,
  were measured daily at rest and during moderate-intensity steady-state exercise
  bouts. In general, the prematurely-born group displayed comparable acclimatisation
  responses to their term-born counterparts at rest, with similar ventilation and
  cardiac output observed between groups at each timepoint. Resting brain TSI was
  however higher in the pre-term than the term-born group upon arrival at high altitude
  (72 ± 7% vs. 68 ± 3%; d = 1.20). Across all timepoints, pre-term adults displayed
  lower exercising cardiac output, underpinned by reduced stroke volume (both p =
  0.035). Nevertheless, exercising brain TSI (70 ± 6% vs. 66 ± 3%; d = 1.35) and pulse
  oxygen saturation (85 ± 3% vs. 82 ± 5%; d = 1.52) were higher in the pre-term participants.
  These findings suggest that healthy prematurely-born adults better maintain brain
  TSI and pulse oxygen saturation during exercise at high altitude, and that they
  exhibit comparable sub-acute acclimatisation patterns to their term-born peers in
  other respects. Importantly, prematurely-born adults should not be discouraged from
  high-altitude sojourns involving physical activity.
