abstract: "New Findings: What is the central question of this study? Is there an association\
  \ of plasma concentration of asymmetric dimethylarginine, which is related to exercise\
  \ capacity in patients with cardiovascular diseases, with oxygen delivery and subsequently\
  \ exercise capacity in healthy subjects in the absence of the potentially confounding\
  \ influence of inflammation and oxidative stress? What is the main finding and its\
  \ importance? Plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine concentrations are not related\
  \ to exercise capacity in healthy subjects, while O2 delivery in the working skeletal\
  \ muscle during the maximal graded-exercise test is not associated with any of the\
  \ l-arginine analogues. ADMA alone does not play a crucial role in local muscle\
  \ perfusion and in maintaining exercise capacity. Abstract: Asymmetric dimethylarginine\
  \ (ADMA) is an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis that could limit\
  \ oxygen (O2) delivery in the working skeletal muscles by altering endothelium-dependent\
  \ vasodilatation. Exercise capacity is associated with plasma ADMA concentrations\
  \ in patients with cardiovascular diseases, but this issue has still not been investigated\
  \ in healthy subjects. We aimed to determine whether plasma ADMA concentrations\
  \ were negatively associated with exercise capacity in young healthy male subjects.\
  \ Ten men with maximal oxygen uptake ((Formula presented.))\_> 65\_mL\_kg\u2212\
  1\_min\u22121 were included in the high exercise capacity group (HI-FIT), and 10\
  \ men with (Formula presented.) < 45\_mL\_kg\u22121\_min\u22121 were included in\
  \ the low exercise capacity group (LO-FIT). Plasma ADMA and other l-arginine analogue\
  \ concentrations were measured before and after a maximal graded-exercise test by\
  \ liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry. Microvascular O2 delivery\
  \ during exercise was estimated through the pattern from the sigmoid model of muscle\
  \ deoxygenation in the vastus lateralis measured by near infrared spectroscopy.\
  \ (Formula presented.) was 60% higher in the HI-FIT group (median: 70.2\_mL\_kg\u2212\
  1\_min\u22121; IQR: 68.0\u201371.9\_mL\_kg\u22121\_min\u22121) than in the LO-FIT\
  \ group (median: 43.8\_mL\_kg\u22121\_min\u22121; IQR: 34.8\u201345.3\_mL\_kg\u2212\
  1\_min\u22121). Plasma ADMA concentrations did not differ between the LO-FIT and\
  \ HI-FIT groups before (0.50\_\xB1 0.06 vs. 0.54\_\xB1 0.07\_$\u03BC$mol\_L\u2212\
  1, respectively) and after the maximal incremental exercise test (0.49\_\xB1 0.08\
  \ vs. 0.55\_\xB1 0.03\_$\u03BC$mol\_L\u22121, respectively). There was no significant\
  \ association of plasma ADMA concentrations with the pattern of local muscle deoxygenation\
  \ and exercise capacity. Exercise capacity and microvascular O2 delivery are not\
  \ related to plasma ADMA concentrations in young healthy male subjects. Our findings\
  \ show that ADMA does not play a crucial role in local muscle perfusion and in maintaining\
  \ exercise capacity without pathological conditions."
