abstract: "Although acute hypoxia is of utmost pathophysiologic relevance in health\
  \ and disease, studies on its effects on both the macro- and microcirculation are\
  \ scarce. Herein, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the effects of acute normobaric\
  \ hypoxia on human macro- and microcirculation. 20 healthy participants were enrolled\
  \ in this study. Hypoxia was induced in a normobaric hypoxia chamber by decreasing\
  \ the partial pressure of oxygen in inhaled air stepwisely (pO2; 21.25\_kPa (0\_\
  k), 16.42\_kPa (2\_k), 12.63\_kPa (4\_k) and 9.64\_kPa (6\_k)). Macrocirculatory\
  \ effects were assessed by cardiac output measurements, microcirculatory changes\
  \ were investigated by sidestream dark-field imaging in the sublingual capillary\
  \ bed and videocapillaroscopy at the nailfold. Exposure to hypoxia resulted in a\
  \ decrease of systemic vascular resistance (p < 0.0001) and diastolic blood pressure\
  \ (p = 0.014). Concomitantly, we observed an increase in heart rate (p < 0.0001)\
  \ and an increase of cardiac output (p < 0.0001). In the sublingual microcirculation,\
  \ exposure to hypoxia resulted in an increase of total vessel density, proportion\
  \ of perfused vessels and perfused vessel density. Furthermore, we observed an increase\
  \ in peripheral capillary density. Exposure to acute hypoxia results in vasodilatation\
  \ of resistance arteries, as well as recruitment of microvessels of the central\
  \ and peripheral microcirculation. The observed macro- and microcirculatory effects\
  \ are most likely a result from compensatory mechanisms to ensure adequate tissue\
  \ oxygenation."
