abstract: The cognitive‐enhancing effects of peppermint have been widely reported.
  Vasodilation, causing an increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the prefrontal
  cortex, has been implicated as a possible mediator. We tested this here. A total
  of N = 25 individuals, all aged over 18 years, were recruited via convenience sampling.
  A randomized, single blind placebo‐controlled, independent groups design was used
  to assess whether groups (peppermint vs. placebo control) could be differentiated
  with respect to change in cognition, assessed via a computerized battery, and change
  in cerebral blood flow, assessed with Near‐Infrared‐Spectroscopy (NIRS), from pre‐post
  intervention. Groups disparities in both cognitive and cerebrovascular change scores
  (from pre‐post intervention) emerged. Improvements in cognitive performance were
  better in the peppermint group. Increases in hemodynamic activity, indexed by Oxygenated
  (Oxy‐Hb) and Total hemoglobin (Total‐Hb), were also greater in the peppermint group.
  Cerebrovascular changes from pre‐to post‐intervention were unrelated to cognitive
  changes over the same period, ruling out mediation effects. In conclusion, 200 mL
  of peppermint, consumed as tea, effectively boosted cognition and cerebral blood
  flow in otherwise healthy adults. Increased cerebral blood flow, however, did not
  mediate the cognitive‐enhancing effects of peppermint. Future research incorporating
  larger samples and exploring other neurophysiological mediators is encouraged.
