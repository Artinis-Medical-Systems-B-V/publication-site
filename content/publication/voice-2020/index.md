abstract: "Rightly emphasized by Pascal Belin \u201CVoices are everywhere\u201D. From\
  \ music to social conversation, the human voice has indeed the extraordinary power\
  \ to communicate our everyday emotions. Shaped by millions of years of evolution,\
  \ the vocal recognition of emotions guides individuals in the best decision to take.\
  \ The capacity to vocally express and then identify an emotion is not a distinctive\
  \ characteristic of Homo sapiens. In fact, most species in the animal kingdom have\
  \ such abilities that maximize their chances of survival and reproductive success.\
  \ Despite homologous traits between humans and other animals, rare are the studies\
  \ using a comparative approach to better understand emotional processing in voices.\
  \ To fill this gap, the present thesis aims to investigate perceptual decision-making\
  \ mechanisms through emotional vocalizations expressed by humans and non-human primates\
  \ (NHP), our closest relatives. According to this goal, six complementary studies\
  \ were performed using imaging as well as behavioral paradigms. Reference"
