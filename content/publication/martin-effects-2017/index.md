abstract: "Background: We sought to determine if a pre-workout supplement (PWS), containing\
  \ multiple ingredients thought to enhance blood flow, increases hyperemia associated\
  \ with resistance training compared to placebo (PBO). Given the potential interaction\
  \ with training loads/time-under-tension, we evaluated the hyperemic response at\
  \ two different loads to failure. Methods: Thirty males participated in this double-blinded\
  \ study. At visit 1, participants were randomly assigned to consume PWS (Reckless\u2122\
  ) or PBO (maltodextrin and glycine) and performed four sets of leg extensions to\
  \ failure at 30% or 80% of their 1-RM 45-min thereafter. 1-wk. later (visit 2),\
  \ participants consumed the same supplement as before, but exercised at the alternate\
  \ load. Heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), femoral artery blood flow, and plasma\
  \ nitrate/nitrite (NOx) were assessed at baseline (BL), 45-min post-PWS/PBO consumption\
  \ (PRE), and 5-min following the last set of leg extensions (POST). Vastus lateralis\
  \ near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was employed during leg extension exercise.\
  \ Repeated measures ANOVAs were performed with time, supplement, and load as independent\
  \ variables and Bonferroni correction applied for multiple post-hoc comparisons.\
  \ Data are reported as mean\xB1SD. Results: With the 30% training load compared\
  \ to 80%, significantly more repetitions were performed (p<0.05), but there was\
  \ no difference in total volume load (p>0.05). NIRS derived minimum oxygenated hemoglobin\
  \ (O2Hb) was lower in the 80% load condition compared to 30% for all rest intervals\
  \ between sets of exercise (p<0.0167). HR and BP did not vary as a function of supplement\
  \ or load. Femoral artery blood flow at POST was higher independent of exercise\
  \ load and treatment. However, a time*supplement*load interaction was observed revealing\
  \ greater femoral artery blood flow with PWS compared to PBO at POST in the 80%\
  \ (+56.8%; p=0.006) but not 30% load condition (+12.7%; p=0.476). Plasma NOx was\
  \ $\u223C$3-fold higher with PWS compared to PBO at PRE and POST (p<0.001). Conclusions:\
  \ Compared to PBO, the PWS consumed herein augmented hyperemia following multiple\
  \ sets to failure at 80% of 1-RM, but not 30%. This specificity may be a product\
  \ of interaction with local perturbations (e.g., reduced tissue oxygenation levels\
  \ [minimum O2Hb] in the 80% load condition) and/or muscle fiber recruitment."
