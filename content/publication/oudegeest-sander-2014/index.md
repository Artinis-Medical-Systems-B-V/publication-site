abstract: "New Findings: What is the central question in this study? It is unknown\
  \ to what extent increasing age influences the dynamic adaptations of cerebral blood\
  \ flow velocity and cortical oxygenation in response to changes in blood pressure\
  \ (cerebral autoregulation) and to changes in carbon dioxide (cerebrovascular CO2\
  \ reactivity). What is the main finding and its importance? We have shown that ageing\
  \ up to 86 years is associated with an overall preservation of dynamic cerebral\
  \ autoregulation and cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity, leading to a sufficiency of\
  \ cerebral cortical oxygenation during daily life activities, despite the decrease\
  \ in absolute cerebral blood flow velocity and increase in cerebrovascular resistance\
  \ with advancing age. With ageing, cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) decreases;\
  \ however, to what extent dynamic cerebral autoregulation and cerebrovascular CO2\
  \ reactivity are influenced by ageing is unknown. The aim was to examine the dynamic\
  \ responses of CBFV and cortical oxygenation to changes in blood pressure (BP) and\
  \ arterial CO2 across different ages. Fifty-eight participants in three age groups\
  \ were included, as follows: young (n = 20, 24 \xB1 2 years old), elderly (n = 20,\
  \ 66 \xB1 1 years old), and older elderly (n = 18, 78 \xB1 3 years old). The CBFV\
  \ was measured using transcranial Doppler ultrasound, simultaneously with oxyhaemoglobin\
  \ (O2Hb) using near-infrared spectroscopy and beat-to-beat BP measurements using\
  \ Finapres. Postural manoeuvres were performed to induce haemodynamic fluctuations.\
  \ Cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity was tested with hyperventilation and CO2 inhalation.\
  \ With age, CBFV decreased (young 59 \xB1 12 cm s-1, elderly 48 \xB1 7 cm s-1 and\
  \ older elderly 42 \xB1 9 cm s-1, P < 0.05) and cerebrovascular resistance increased\
  \ (1.46 \xB1 0.58, 1.81 \xB1 0.36 and 1.98 \xB1 0.52 mmHg cm-1 s-1, respectively,\
  \ P < 0.05). Normalized gain (autoregulatory damping) increased with age for BP-CBFV\
  \ (0.88 \xB1 0.18, 1.31 \xB1 0.30 and 1.06 \xB1 0.34, respectively, P < 0.05) and\
  \ CBFV-O2Hb (0.10 \xB1 0.09, 0.12 \xB1 0.04 and 0.17 \xB1 0.08, respectively, P\
  \ < 0.05) during the repeated sit-stand manoeuvre at 0.05 Hz. Even though the absolute\
  \ changes in CBFV and cerebrovascular resistance index during the cerebrovascular\
  \ CO2 reactivity were higher in the young group, the percentage changes in CBFV,\
  \ cerebrovascular resistance index and O2Hb were similar in all age groups. In conclusion,\
  \ there was no decline in dynamic cerebral autoregulation and cerebrovascular CO2\
  \ reactivity with increasing age up to 86 years. Despite the decrease in cerebral\
  \ blood flow velocity and increase in cerebrovascular resistance with advancing\
  \ age, CBFV and cortical oxygenation were not compromised in these elderly humans\
  \ during manoeuvres that mimic daily life activities. \xA9 2013 The Physiological\
