abstract: "Changes in physical performance were assessed in response to two successive\
  \ doubles badminton matches with implementation of ischemic pre-conditioning (IPC)\
  \ or sham treatment during recovery period between matches. Eight French national\
  \ team badminton players (4 males, 4 females) performed two successive doublesmatches\
  \ (2 \xD7 45 min), with 60 min of recovery in-between, during which they received\
  \ three 5-min cycles of either an IPC (220 mmHg) or a sham (SHAM) (50 mmHg) intervention.\
  \ A series of physical tests was performed immediately following the first (Post\
  \ 1) and second (Post 2) match. Jump height (squat and countermovement jumps), leg\
  \ power (multi-rebound jumps) and sprint time (L-test) remained unchanged from Post\
  \ 1 to Post 2 (all P>0.193), and did not differ between conditions (all P>0.173).\
  \ During a badminton-specific repeated-agility test, neither performance-related\
  \ variables (i.e., best time, total time and sprint decrement score) nor vastus\
  \ lateralis muscle tissue saturation index displayed a main effect for condition\
  \ (all P>0.116), time (all P>0.091) or time \xD7 condition interaction (all P>0.730).\
  \ Implementing IPC during the recovery period between successive doubles badminton\
  \ demonstrated no beneficial effect on physical performance and muscle oxygenation\
  \ trends."
