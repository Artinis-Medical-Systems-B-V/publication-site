abstract: Introduction  Glycated hemoglobin can interfere with oxygen delivery and
  CO 2 removal during exercise. Additionally, pancreatic insufficiency increases oxidative
  stress and exacerbates exercise intolerance in people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF).
  This investigation sought to test the hypotheses that elevated Hemoglobin A 1c (HbA
  1c ) can negatively affect exercise parameters in PwCF and that reductions in oxidative
  stress can improve tissue oxygenation in individuals with elevated HbA 1c .    Methods  Twenty
  four PwCF were divided into two groups; normal HbA1c textless5.7% (N-HbA 1c ) and
  elevated HbA 1c textgreater5.7% (E-HbA 1c ). A maximal exercise test was conducted
  to obtain peak oxygen uptake (VO 2 peak), VO 2 at ventilatory threshold (VT), ventilatory
  parameters (V E /VCO 2 slope and end-tidal CO 2 (petCO 2 )). Near-Infrared Spectroscopy
  (NIRS) was used to assess muscle oxygenated/deoxygenated hemoglobin during exercise.
  A subset of individuals with E-HbA 1c were given an antioxidant cocktail (AOC) for
  4 weeks to determine the effects on tissue oxygenation during exercise.    Results  A
  negative relationship between HbA 1c and VO 2 peak at VT was observed (r = −0.511;
  p = 0.018). In addition, a positive relationship between HbA 1c and V E /VCO 2 slope
  ( r = 0.587; p = 0.005) and a negative relationship between HbA 1c and petCO 2 at
  maximal exercise ( r = −0.472 ;p = 0.031) was observed. N-HbA 1c had greater VO
  2 peak ( p = 0.021), VO 2 at VT ( p = 0.004), petCO 2 ( p = 0.002), and lower V
  E /VCO 2 slope ( p = 0.004) compared with E-HbA 1c . Muscle deoxygenated hemoglobin
  at VT was higher in N-HbA 1c vs. E-HbA 1c and 4 weeks of AOC improved skeletal muscle
  utilization of oxygen.    Conclusion Findings demonstrate that glycated hemoglobin
  may lead to tissue oxygenation impairment and ventilation inefficiency during exercise
  in PwCF. In addition, antioxidant supplementation may lead to improved tissue oxygenation
  during exercise.
