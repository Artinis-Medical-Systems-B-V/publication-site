Glycated hemoglobin can interfere with oxygen delivery and CO
2
removal during exercise. Additionally, pancreatic insufficiency increases oxidative stress and exacerbates exercise intolerance in people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF). This investigation sought to test the hypotheses that elevated Hemoglobin A
1c
(HbA
1c
) can negatively affect exercise parameters in PwCF and that reductions in oxidative stress can improve tissue oxygenation in individuals with elevated HbA
1c
.



Methods

Twenty four PwCF were divided into two groups; normal HbA1c \textless5.7% (N-HbA
1c
) and elevated HbA
1c
\textgreater5.7% (E-HbA
1c
). A maximal exercise test was conducted to obtain peak oxygen uptake (VO
2
peak), VO
2
at ventilatory threshold (VT), ventilatory parameters (V
E
/VCO
2
slope and end-tidal CO
2
(petCO
2
)). Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to assess muscle oxygenated/deoxygenated hemoglobin during exercise. A subset of individuals with E-HbA
1c
were given an antioxidant cocktail (AOC) for 4 weeks to determine the effects on tissue oxygenation during exercise.



Results

A negative relationship between HbA
1c
and VO
2
peak at VT was observed (r = −0.511; p = 0.018). In addition, a positive relationship between HbA
1c
and V
E
/VCO
2
slope ( r = 0.587; p = 0.005) and a negative relationship between HbA
1c
and petCO
2
at maximal exercise ( r = −0.472 ;p = 0.031) was observed. N-HbA
1c
had greater VO
2
peak ( p = 0.021), VO
2
at VT ( p = 0.004), petCO
2
( p = 0.002), and lower V
E
/VCO
2
slope ( p = 0.004) compared with E-HbA
1c
. Muscle deoxygenated hemoglobin at VT was higher in N-HbA
1c
vs. E-HbA
1c
and 4 weeks of AOC improved skeletal muscle utilization of oxygen.



Conclusion
Findings demonstrate that glycated hemoglobin may lead to tissue oxygenation impairment and ventilation inefficiency during exercise in PwCF. In addition, antioxidant supplementation may lead to improved tissue oxygenation during exercise.},
