abstract: Older adults typically perform more poorly than younger adults in free recall
  memory tests. This age-related deficit has been linked to decline of brain activation
  and brain prefrontal lateralization, which may be the result of compensatory mechanisms.
  In the present pilot study, we investigated the effect of age on prefrontal cortex
  (PFC) activation during performance of a task that requires memory associations
  (temporal vs. spatial clustering), using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS).
  Ten younger adults, ten cognitively high-performing older individuals, and ten low-performing
  older individuals completed a free recall task, where either a temporal or spatial
  strategy (but not both simultaneously) could be employed to retrieve groups of same-category
  stimuli, whilst changes in PFC hemodynamics were recorded by means of a 12-channel
  fNIRS system. The results suggest PFC activation, and right lateralization specific
  to younger adults. Moreover, age did not affect use of memory organization, given
  that temporal clustering was preferred over spatial clustering in all groups. These
  findings are in line with previous literature on the aging brain and on temporal
  organization of memory. Our results also suggest that the PFC may be specifically
  involved in memory for temporal associations. Future research may consider whether
  age-related deficits in temporal organization may be an early sign of PFC pathology
  and possible neurodegeneration.
