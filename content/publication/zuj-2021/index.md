abstract: "Purpose: Orthostatic hypotension, leading to cerebral hypoperfusion, can\
  \ result in postural instability and falls in older adults. We determined the efficacy\
  \ of a novel, intermittent pneumatic compression system, applying pressure around\
  \ the lower legs, as a countermeasure against orthostatic stress in older adults.\
  \ Methods: Data were collected from 13 adults (4 male) over 65\_years of age. Non-invasive\
  \ ultrasound measured middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv) and finger photoplethysmography\
  \ measured mean arterial blood pressure (MAP). Intermittent lower leg compression\
  \ was applied in a peristaltic manner in the local diastolic phase of each cardiac\
  \ cycle to optimize venous return during 1-min of seated rest and during a sit-to-stand\
  \ transition to 1-min of quiet standing with compression initiated 15\_s before\
  \ transition. Results: During seated rest, compression resulted in a 4.5 \xB1 6.5\_\
  mmHg increase in MAP, and 2.3 \xB1 2.1\_cm/s increase in MCAv (p < 0.05). MAP and\
  \ MCAv increased during the 15\_s of applied compression before the posture transition\
  \ (2.3 \xB1 7.2\_mmHg and 2.1 \xB1 4.0\_cm/s, respectively, p < 0.05) with main\
  \ effects for both variables confirming continued benefit during the transition\
  \ and quiet stand periods. Conclusions: Application of carefully timed, intermittent\
  \ compression to the lower legs of older adults increased MAP and MCAv during seated\
  \ rest and maintained an elevated MAP and MCAv during a transition to standing posture.\
  \ Future research could assess the benefits of this technology for persons at risk\
  \ for orthostatic hypotension on standing and while walking in an effort to reduce\
  \ injurious, unexplained falls in older adults."
