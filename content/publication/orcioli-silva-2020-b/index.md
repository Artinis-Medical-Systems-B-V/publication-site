abstract: "Background. Although dopaminergic medication improves dual task walking\
  \ in people with Parkinson disease (PD), the underlying neural mechanisms are not\
  \ yet fully understood. As prefrontal cognitive resources are involved in dual task\
  \ walking, evaluation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is required. Objective. To\
  \ investigate the effect of dopaminergic medication on PFC activity and gait parameters\
  \ during dual task walking in people with PD. Methods. A total of 20 individuals\
  \ with PD (69.8 \xB1 5.9 years) and 30 healthy older people (68.0 \xB1 5.6 years)\
  \ performed 2 walking conditions: single and dual task (walking while performing\
  \ a digit vigilance task). A mobile functional near infrared spectroscopy system\
  \ and an electronic sensor carpet were used to analyze PFC activation and gait parameters,\
  \ respectively. Relative concentrations of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) from the\
  \ left and right PFC were measured. Results. People with PD in the off state did\
  \ not present changes in HbO2 level in the left PFC across walking conditions. In\
  \ contrast, in the on state, they presented increased HbO2 levels during dual task\
  \ compared with single task. Regardless of medication state, people with PD presented\
  \ increased HbO2 levels in the right PFC during dual task walking compared with\
  \ single task. The control group demonstrated increased PFC activity in both hemispheres\
  \ during dual task compared with single task. People with PD showed increases in\
  \ both step length and velocity in the on state compared with the off state. Conclusions.\
  \ PD limits the activation of the left PFC during dual task walking, and dopaminergic\
  \ medication facilitates its recruitment."
