abstract: 'Background: Exercise capacity is markedly impaired in patients with end-stage
  renal disease (ESRD) due to neuromuscular dysfunction and reduced oxygen delivery.
  This study aimed to investigate the effects of NMES during HD on exercise capacity
  in patients with ESRD. It specifically examined neuromuscular and hemodynamic adaptations.
  Methods: Twenty-two patients with ESRD were randomized to a neuromuscular electrical
  stimulation training group (NSTG, n = 11) or a control group (CG, n = 11). The NSTG
  underwent intradialytic quadriceps NMES three times per week for 12 weeks (40 min/session).
  Exercise capacity was evaluated via sustained isometric contraction at 50% of maximal
  voluntary contraction (MVC) until exhaustion. Neuromuscular function was assessed
  through voluntary activation (ΔVA) and potentiated twitch force (ΔQtw,pot), while
  muscle oxygenation (ΔO2Hb, ΔHHb, ΔTHb) of the vastus lateralis was continuously
  monitored using near-infrared spectroscopy. Results: After the intervention, the
  NSTG showed a significant +20% increase in Tlim (103.9 ± 14.4 s to 123.3 ± 16.6
  s; p = 0.01) and +30% improvement in MVC (421.3 ± 24.9 N to 550.4 ± 20.3 N; p textless
  0.01), while no improvements were observed in CG. Resting VA increased by ≈7% in
  NSTG (90.2 ± 3.7% to 96.8 ± 2.5%; p = 0.012). Improved muscle oxygenation and reduced
  twitch force suggest enhanced oxidative capacity and greater peripheral fatigue
  tolerance. Conclusions: Intradialytic NMES elicited robust improvements in exercise
  capacity, muscle strength, and oxygen utilization in ESRD patients by enhancing
  both central activation and peripheral oxidative adaptations. These findings support
  NMES as a feasible and effective rehabilitative strategy to counteract fatigue and
  functional decline in the ESRD population.'
