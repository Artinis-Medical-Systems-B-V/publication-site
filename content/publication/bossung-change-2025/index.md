abstract: Purpose This study investigated the change in mitochondrial capacity and
  VO2max in elite triathlon, cycling, and Greco-Roman wrestling athletes over a 28-day
  training period. Methods Sixteen elite athletes (23 ± 2.5 years; 176 ± 6 cm; 76 ± 8
  kg; 65 ± 6.9 ml/min/kg) participated. Mitochondrial capacity was assessed before
  (pre) and after (post) a 28-day training period by measuring the increase in deoxygenated
  hemoglobin (HHb) in the m. vastus lateralis during three consecutive one-minute
  rapid cuff occlusion periods using near-infrared spectroscopy. VO2max was measured
  via a treadmill ramp test at the same time points. Results The analyses revealed
  significant differences between pre- and post-measurements, with significant improvements
  in the second (Δτ2 = − 3.4 ± 2.7 s, p = 0.001) and third (Δτ3 = − 5.0 ± 5.1 s, p = 0.006)
  occlusion period. Correlation analyses demonstrated a moderate negative relationship
  between the first occlusion tau (τ) rate and VO2max at pre-test (r = − 0.58, p = 0.02)
  and an even stronger negative correlation at post-test (r = − 0.62, p = 0.01). Within-subject
  analysis identified 14 athletes as responders. Conclusion The changes in τ rates
  indicate significant improvements in mitochondrial capacity over a period of 28
  days in elite athletes, underscoring the utility of NIRS-derived τ rates for monitoring
  changes in elite athletes.
