abstract: "Purpose: In this study, we investigated the effects of vibration of the\
  \ whole lower leg on the content and the oxygenation of hemoglobin in the unloaded\
  \ relaxed lateral gastrocnemius muscle. Vibration was applied orthogonal to and\
  \ in parallel with leg axis to examine whether the extrusion of blood depends on\
  \ an alignment of main vessel direction, axis of vibration and gravity. Method:\
  \ The blood volume in the muscles was altered by horizontal and 30\xB0 upright body\
  \ posture. Fifteen male subjects were exposed to 4 sets of experiments with both\
  \ vibration directions and both tilt angles applied in permutated order. The absence\
  \ of voluntary muscular activity and the potential occurrence of compound action\
  \ potentials by stretch reflexes were monitored using electromyography. Total hemoglobin\
  \ and tissue saturation index were measured with near infrared spectroscopy. Changes\
  \ of lower leg circumference were measured with strain gauge system placed around\
  \ the calf. Result: Vibration caused decrease in tHb and increase in TSI indicating\
  \ extrusion of predominantly venous blood from the muscle. In 30\xB0 tilted position,\
  \ muscles contained more blood at baseline and vibration ejected more blood from\
  \ the muscle compared with horizontal posture (p < 0.01). At 30\xB0 tilting deeper\
  \ drop in tHb and steeper increase in TSI (p < 0.01) were observed when vibration\
  \ was applied in parallel with the length axis of muscle. Conclusion: It is concluded\
  \ that the vibration extrudes more blood in 30\xB0 head up posture and the vibration\
  \ applied in parallel with the length axis of the muscle is more effective than\
  \ orthogonal vibration."
