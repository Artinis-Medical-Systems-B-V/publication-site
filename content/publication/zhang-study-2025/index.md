abstract: 'Background: Hemiplegic cerebral palsy (HCP) is a motor dysfunction disorder
  resulting from perinatal developmental brain injury, predominantly impairing upper
  limb function in children. Nonetheless, there has been insufficient research on
  the brain activation patterns and inter-brain coordination mechanisms of HCP children
  when performing motor control tasks, especially in contrast to children with typical
  development(CD). Objective: This cross-sectional study employed functional near-infrared
  spectroscopy (fNIRS) to systematically compare the cerebral blood flow dynamics
  and brain network characteristics of HCP children and CD children while performing
  upper-limb mirror training tasks. Methods: The study ultimately included 14 HCP
  children and 28 CD children. fNIRS technology was utilized to record changes in
  oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) signals in the bilateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC/RPFC)
  and motor cortex (LMC/RMC) of the subjects while they performed mirror training
  tasks. Generalized linear model (GLM) analysis was used to compare differences in
  activation intensity between HCP children and CD children in the prefrontal cortex
  and motor cortex. Finally, conditional Granger causality (GC) analysis was applied
  to construct a directed brain network model, enabling directional analysis of causal
  interactions between different brain regions. Results: Brain activation: HCP children
  showed weaker LPFC activation than CD children in the NMR task (t = −2.032, p =
  0.049); enhanced LMC activation in the NML task (t = 2.202, p = 0.033); and reduced
  RMC activation in the MR task (t = −2.234, p = 0.031). Intragroup comparisons revealed
  significant differences in LMC activation between the NMR and NML tasks (M = −1.128
  ± 2.764, t = −1.527, p = 0.025) and increased separation in RMC activation between
  the MR and ML tasks (M = −1.674 ± 2.584, t = −2.425, p = 0.031). Cortical effective
  connectivity: HCP group RPFC → RMC connectivity was weaker than that in CD children
  in the NMR/NML tasks (NMR: t = −2.491, p = 0.018; NML: t = −2.386, p = 0.023); RMC
  → LMC connectivity was weakened in the NMR task (t = −2.395, p = 0.022). Conclusions:
  This study reveals that children with HCP exhibit distinct abnormal characteristics
  in both cortical activation patterns and effective brain network connectivity during
  upper limb mirror training tasks, compared to children with CD. These characteristic
  alterations may reflect the neural mechanisms underlying motor control deficits
  in HCP children, involving deficits in prefrontal regulatory function and compensatory
  reorganization of the motor cortex. The identified fNIRS indicators provide new
  insights into understanding brain dysfunction in HCP and may offer objective evidence
  for research into personalized, precision-based neurorehabilitation intervention
  strategies.'
