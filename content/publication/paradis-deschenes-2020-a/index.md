abstract: 'This study investigated the efficacy of ischemic preconditioning (IPC)
  on the recovery of maximal aerobic performance and physiological responses compared
  with commonly used techniques. Nine endurance athletes performed two 5-km cycling
  time trials (TT) interspersed by 45 minutes of recovery that included either IPC,
  active recovery (AR) or neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) in a randomized
  crossover design. Performance, blood markers, arterial O2 saturation (SpO2), heart
  rate (HR), near-infrared spectroscopy-derived muscle oxygenation parameters and
  perceptual measures were recorded throughout TTs and re-covery. Differences were
  analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVAs and Cohen''s effect size (ES). The decrement
  in chron-ometric performance from TT1 to TT2 was similar between recovery modalities
  (IPC:-6.1 sec, AR:-7.9 sec, NMES:-5.4 sec, p = 0.84, ES 0.05). The modalities induced
  similar increases in blood volume before the start of TT2 (IPC: 13.3%, AR: 14.6%,
  NMES: 15.0%, p = 0.79, ES 0.06) and similar changes in lactate concentration and
  pH. There were negligible differences between conditions in bicarbonate concentration,
  base excess of blood and total concentration of carbon dioxide, and no difference
  in SpO2, HR and muscle O2 extraction during exercise (all p > 0.05). We interpreted
  these findings to suggest that IPC is as effective as AR and NMES to enhance muscle
  blood volume, metabolic by-prod-ucts clearance and maximal endurance performance.
  IPC could therefore complement the athlete''s toolbox to promote recovery.'
