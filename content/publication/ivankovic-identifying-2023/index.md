abstract: Aim To identify specific activities associated with high cognitive load
  during simulated pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (POHCA) resuscitation
  using physiological monitoring with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).  Methods
  We recruited teams of emergency medical services (EMS) responders from fire departments
  located throughout the Portland, OR metropolitan area to participate in POHCA simulations.
  Teams consisted of both paramedics and emergency medical technicians (EMTs), with
  one paramedic serving as the person in charge (PIC). The PIC was outfitted with
  the OctaMon to collect fNIRS signals from the prefrontal cortex. Signals reported
  changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin concentrations, which were used
  to determine moments of increased cognitive activity. Increased cognitive activity
  was determined by significant increases in oxygenated hemoglobin and decreases in
  deoxygenated hemoglobin. Significant changes in fNIRS signals were associated with
  specific concurrent clinical tasks recorded by two independent researchers using
  video review.  Results We recorded cognitive activity of EMS providers in 18 POHCA
  simulations. We found that a proportion of PICâ€™s experienced relatively high cognitive
  load during medication administration, defibrillation, and rhythm checks compared
  to other events.  Conclusion EMS providers commonly experienced increased cognitive
  activity during key resuscitation tasks that were related to safely coordinating
  team members around calculating and administering medications, defibrillation, and
  rhythm and pulse checks. Understanding more about activities that require high cognitive
  demand can inform future interventions that reduce cognitive load.
