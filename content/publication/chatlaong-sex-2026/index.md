abstract: Abstract Sex differences in near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) reactive hyperemia
  outcomes have been previously reported, with females generally having a lower reperfusion
  slope. Sex differences have also been reported for adipose tissue thickness (ATT),
  which affects the NIRS signal, and desaturation during occlusion, which may act
  on reperfusion slopes. We aimed to compare statistically adjusted and unadjusted
  sex differences in reperfusion slope during reactive hyperemia. Methods 23 female
  and 22 male participants completed forearm and thigh vascular occlusion tests. ATT
  was measured via ultrasound. Reperfusion slopes (StO2%/s) were compared between
  sexes using linear models with and without desaturation slope (StO2%/s) and ATT
  as covariates. Results are mean or mean difference [95 % CI]. Results In both limbs,
  females had greater ATT (p textless 0.001). Desaturation rate was lower in females
  for the leg (−0.02 [−0.03, −0.01]), but not the arm (0.00 [−0.01, 0.02]). Unadjusted,
  males had greater reperfusion slope in the leg (females = 0.91 [0.70, 1.11], males
  = 1.59 [1.33, 1.85], p textless 0.001) but not the arm (females = 1.60 [1.36, 1.84],
  males = 1.57 [1.29, 1.86], p = 0.874). Sex differences were not observed in adjusted
  models (both p ≥ 0.631). ATT and desaturation slope explained unique variance in
  the leg (both p ≤ 0.001), but only desaturation slope did in the arm (p textless
  0.001). Conclusion Sex differences may have been related to differing ATT and desaturation
  rates. Researchers may consider adjusting for ATT and/or desaturation rate when
  estimating sex differences with NIRS reactive hyperemia.
