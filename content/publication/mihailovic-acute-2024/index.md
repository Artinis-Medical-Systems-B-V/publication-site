abstract: 'Purpose :  This study aimed to investigate acute psychophysiological responses
  to repeated-sprint training in hypoxia (RSH) combined with whole-body cryotherapy
  (WBC).  Method :  Sixteen trained cyclists performed 3 sessions in randomized order:
  RSH, WBC-RSH (WBC pre-RSH), and RSH-WBC (WBC post-RSH). RSH consisted of 3 sets
  of 5 × 10-second sprints with 20-second recovery at a simulated altitude of 3000 m.
  Power output, muscle oxygenation (tissue saturation index), heart-rate variability,
  and recovery perception were analyzed. Sleep quality was assessed on the nights
  following test sessions and compared with a control night using nocturnal ActiGraphy
  and heart-rate variability.  Results :  Power output did not differ between the
  conditions ( P = .27), while the decrease in tissue saturation index was reduced
  for WBC-RSH compared to RSH-WBC in the last set. In both conditions with WBC, the
  recovery perception was higher compared to RSH (WBC-RSH: +15.4%, and RSH-WBC: +21.9%,
  P textless .05). The number of movements during the RSH-WBC night was significantly
  lower than for the control night (−18.7%, P textless .01) and WBC-RSH (−14.9%, P
  textless .05). RSH led to a higher root mean square of the successive differences
  of R-R intervals and high-frequency band during the first hour of sleep compared
  to the control night ( P textless .05) and RSH-WBC ( P textless .01).  Conclusions
  :  Inclusion of WBC in an RSH session did not modify the power output but could
  improve prolonged performance in hypoxia by maintaining muscle oxygenation. A single
  RSH session did not deteriorate sleep quality. WBC, particularly when performed
  after RSH, positively influenced recovery perception and sleep.'
